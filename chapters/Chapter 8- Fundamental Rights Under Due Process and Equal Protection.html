<div id="fc09928e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc09928f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>THE CONCEPT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fc099290-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has held that some liberties are so important that they are deemed to be “fundamental rights” and that generally the government cannot infringe them unless strict scrutiny is met; that is, the government’s action must be necessary to achieve a compelling purpose. This chapter examines many of these liberties, including rights protecting family autonomy, procreation, sexual activity and sexual orientation, medical care decision making, travel, voting, and access to the courts. This chapter concludes by examining procedural due process. Freedom of speech and religious freedom also are deemed fundamental rights and are considered in Chapters 9 and 10, respectively. Criminal procedure protections—such as the Fourth Amendment’s safeguard from unreasonable searches and seizure, the Fifth Amendment’s protection from self-incrimination and double jeopardy, the Sixth Amendment’s assurance of a speedy trial before an impartial jury, and the Eighth Amendment’s right to bail and prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment—are beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p id="fc099291-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relatively few claims of rights listed above trigger heightened scrutiny and require the government to meet strict scrutiny. Most claims of rights under equal protection or due process only receive minimal judicial scrutiny; that is, the government’s action only has to meet the rational basis test and be shown to be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. For example, as discussed in Chapter 6, claims of economic liberties under the Due Process Clause only receive rational basis review.</p>
<p id="fc099292-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter, though, examines those rights that are deemed fundamental. Of course, this chapter also will consider many examples where the Court has refused to recognize a particular right as fundamental and thus has used only rational basis review in upholding a law. The rights considered in this chapter share much in common. Almost all of these rights are not mentioned in the <span title="904" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-904">p. 904</span>text of the Constitution.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10040_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10040_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> Thus, all raise the important issue of how the Court should decide whether a liberty should be regarded as a fundamental right. Also, for almost all of these rights, the Supreme Court has indicated that strict scrutiny should be used, which means that the government must justify its interference by proving that its action is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.</p>
<p id="fc09b9a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost all of these rights have been protected by the Court under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and/or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Some of the rights have been protected solely under the Due Process Clause. For example, thus far, the Supreme Court has considered a constitutional right to refuse medical care as an aspect of the “liberty” protected in the Due Process Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10050_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10050_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> Other rights have so far been protected under the Equal Protection Clause. For example, the right to travel has been safeguarded under equal protection.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10058_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10058_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> Also, the right to vote has been protected both under this clause and the Fifteenth Amendment that prohibits government racial discrimination concerning voting.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10066_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10066_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span></p>
<p id="fc09b9a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of these rights, though, have been protected by the Court under both due process and equal protection. For example, the Court has invalidated state laws restricting access to contraceptives both as violating equal protection and as infringing the right to privacy.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10074_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10074_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span> In some cases, the justices disagree among themselves as to whether the right is protected under due process or equal protection. In Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978), presented below, the majority opinion found the right to marry to be a fundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause, but the concurring opinion used a due process approach. In United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013), the Court relied solely on equal protection to strike down a key provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, but in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), the Court found that state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage violate the right to marry under both due process and equal protection.</p>
<p id="fc09b9aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relatively little depends on whether the Court uses due process or equal protection as the basis for protecting a fundamental right. Under either provision, the Court must decide whether a claimed liberty is sufficiently important to be regarded as fundamental, even though it is not mentioned in the text of the <span title="905" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-905">p. 905</span>Constitution. Also, once a right is deemed fundamental, under due process or equal protection, strict scrutiny is generally used.</p>
<p id="fc09b9ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The major difference between due process and equal protection as the basis for protecting fundamental rights is in how the constitutional arguments are phrased. If a right is safeguarded under due process, the constitutional issue is whether the government’s interference is justified by a sufficient purpose. But if the right is protected under equal protection, the issue is whether the government’s discrimination as to who can exercise the right is justified by a sufficient purpose. Although the difference is generally just semantics and phrasing, there can be a real distinction: If a law denies the right to everyone, then due process would be the best grounds for analysis, but if a law denies a right to some, while allowing it to others, the discrimination can be challenged as offending equal protection or the violation of the right can be objected to under due process.</p>

<p id="fc09e0be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Amendment is often mentioned in discussions of fundamental rights, especially rights not expressly mentioned in the text of the Constitution. The Ninth Amendment states: “The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights, shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people.” The Supreme Court rarely has invoked the Ninth Amendment. A notable exception is Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), presented below, in which Justice Goldberg, in a concurring opinion, reviewed the history of the Ninth Amendment and relied on it to justify invalidating a law prohibiting use of contraceptives.</p>
<p id="fc09e0bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Amendment generally is not seen as the source of rights in that rights are not protected under it; there are no Ninth Amendment rights. Rather, the Ninth Amendment is used to provide a textual justification for the Court to protect nontextual rights, such as the right to privacy. From this perspective, the Ninth Amendment is not a repository of rights or even a provision that is itself interpreted but instead is a justification for the Court to safeguard unenumerated liberties.</p>

<p id="fc09e0c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of a right triggers two distinct burdens on the government. One is substantive; the government must justify an infringement by showing that its action is sufficiently related to an adequate justification. For example, when strict scrutiny is used, the substantive burden on the government is demonstrating that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose. The other burden on the government is procedural. When the government takes away a person’s life, liberty, or property, it must provide adequate procedures. Procedural due process is discussed in the final section of this chapter.</p>
<p id="fc09e0c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A simple example illustrates the concepts of substantive and procedural due process. As discussed below in section C, the Supreme Court has interpreted the word “liberty” in the Due Process Clause to mean that parents have a fundamental right to custody of their children. Substantive due process, as explained below, requires that the government show that terminating custody is necessary <span title="906" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-906">p. 906</span>to achieve a compelling purpose. Procedural due process, as discussed in the final section, requires that the government provide notice and a hearing—procedures—before terminating custody.</p>
<p id="fc09e0c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Except for the final section on procedural due process, this chapter focuses on protection of substantive rights under due process and equal protection. In other words, the issue in all of these cases is whether the government adequately justifies its actions allegedly infringing fundamental rights.</p>

<p id="fc09e0c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Litigation and judicial decision making in cases about individual rights can be understood as addressing one or more of four questions. First, is there a fundamental right? Second, is the right infringed? Third, is the government’s action justified by a sufficient purpose? And fourth, are the means sufficiently related to the goal sought? These four questions arise in all areas concerning rights, including economic liberties discussed in Chapter 6 and First Amendment rights discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. Because these issues arise in cases throughout this chapter, the four questions are briefly examined here before consideration of particular rights.</p>


<div id="fc09e0c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc09e0c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>FIRST ISSUE: IS THERE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT?</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fc0a07da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a right is deemed fundamental, the government usually will be able to prevail only if it meets strict scrutiny, but if the right is not fundamental, generally only the rational basis test is applied. This is the framework for judicial review articulated in the famous <i>Carolene Products</i> more than a half century ago: The judiciary will defer to the legislature unless there is discrimination against a “discrete and insular” minority or infringement of a fundamental right.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span></p>
<p id="fc0a07dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997), discussed hereafter, the crucial question was whether there was a fundamental right to physician-assisted death. If the Court had found such a right in the liberty of the Due Process Clause for terminally ill patients, a Washington law prohibiting aiding and abetting a suicide would have been upheld only if the state had met strict scrutiny. But the Court’s refusal to find such a right meant that only rational basis review was used.</p>
<p id="fc0a07dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional interpretation debate, discussed in more detail in Chapter 1, has been primarily about how the Court should decide what rights are fundamental and particularly whether it should find fundamental rights that are not supported by the text or the clear intent of the framers. Many different theories have been advanced to explain when the Court should or shouldn’t deem rights to be fundamental.</p>
<p id="fc0a07de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="907" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-907">p. 907</span>For example, originalists take the position that fundamental rights are limited to those liberties explicitly stated in the text or clearly intended by the framers. An originalist would say that the Court acts impermissibly and usurps the democratic process if it finds other rights to be fundamental. Nonoriginalism, in contrast, is the view that it is permissible for the Court to protect fundamental rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution or intended by its drafters.</p>
<p id="fc0a07df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although, as described in Chapter 1, the debate often has been characterized as a dispute between originalists and nonoriginalists, many other theories also have been advanced for identifying fundamental rights. For example, in addition to strict originalism that limits the Court to rights stated in the text or intended by the framers, there also is moderate originalism, which is the view that the judiciary should implement the framers’ general intent, but not necessarily their specific views.</p>
<p id="fc0a07e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, at times, the Court often has looked to history and tradition in deciding what rights not mentioned in the text are fundamental. For instance, the Supreme Court has said that fundamental rights include those liberties that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100F5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span> In addition to the difficulty of deciding what counts as a sufficient tradition for recognizing a right as fundamental, there also is the question of the abstraction at which the right is stated. At a sufficiently general level of abstraction, any liberty can be justified as consistent with the nation’s traditions. At a very specific level of abstraction, few nontextual rights would be justified.</p>
<p id="fc0a07e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many other theories as well for deciding what is a fundamental right. Some argue that the Court’s preeminent role is perfecting the processes of government and that the Court should only recognize nontextual rights that concern ensuring adequate representation and the effective operation of the political process.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100FF_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100FF_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span> Others argue that the Court should use natural law principles in deciding what rights to protect as fundamental.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010D_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1010D_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span> Still other scholars maintain that the Court should recognize nontextual fundamental rights that are supported by a deeply embedded moral consensus that exists in society.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1011B_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1011B_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span></p>
<p id="fc0a2ef6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These theories, and the arguments for and against them, are discussed in Chapter 1. Throughout this chapter an underlying question is whether a particular liberty should be deemed a fundamental right, and that raises the methodological question of how the Court should decide this issue. Inevitably, it provokes debate about the proper role of an unelected judiciary in a democratic society and also about what activities are so important that the courts should find a fundamental right to exist.</p>

<p id="fc0a2ef9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If there is a fundamental right, the next question must be: Has the government infringed the right?

For example, if there is a fundamental right to purchase and use contraceptives, a law that outlaws all distribution and use of birth control obviously is an infringement. But when is burdening the exercise of a fundamental right also to be considered an infringement requiring the application of strict scrutiny?</p>
<p id="fc0a2efa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has said that in evaluating whether there is a violation of a right it considers “[t]he directness and substantiality of the interference.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10144_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10144_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span> But there has been surprisingly little discussion of what constitutes a direct and substantial interference with a right.</p>

<p id="fc0a5614-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under strict scrutiny it is not enough for the government to prove a compelling purpose behind a law; the government also must show that the law is <i>necessary</i> to achieve the objective. This requires that the government prove that it could not attain the goal through any means less restrictive of the right. In comparison, under rational basis review, the means only has to be a reasonable way to achieve the goal and the government is not required to use the least restrictive alternative.</p>
<p id="fc0a5615-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no formula for deciding whether a means is necessary or whether a less restrictive means can suffice.

<p id="fc0a561e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents a constitutional question never addressed by this Court: whether a statutory scheme adopted by the State of Virginia to prevent marriages between persons solely on the basis of racial classifications violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p id="fc0a561f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1958, two residents of Virginia, Mildred Jeter, a Negro woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were married in the District of Columbia pursuant to its laws. Shortly after their marriage, the Lovings returned to Virginia and established their marital abode in Caroline County. At the October Term, 1958, of the Circuit Court of Caroline County, a grand jury issued an indictment charging the Lovings with violating Virginia’s ban on interracial marriages. On January 6, 1959, the Lovings pleaded guilty to the charge and were sentenced to one year in jail; however, the trial judge suspended the sentence for a period of 25 years on the condition that the Lovings leave the State and not return to Virginia together for 25 years. He stated in an opinion that:</p>

<p id="fc0a5621-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After their convictions, the Lovings took up residence in the District of Columbia. On November 6, 1963, they filed a motion in the state trial court to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence on the ground that the statutes which they had violated were repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the antimiscegenation statutes and, after modifying the sentence, affirmed the convictions.</p>
<p id="fc0a5622-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia is now one of 16 States which prohibit and punish marriages on the basis of racial classifications.

State of Oklahoma (1942). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.</p>

<p id="fc0a7d37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 378 (1978), the Court again struck down a law as infringing the right to marry. A Wisconsin law prevented an individual from obtaining a marriage license without court approval if the person had a minor child not in his or her custody for whom there was a court order to pay support. The court could grant permission to marry only if there was proof that all child support payments were up to date.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d38-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court began by reviewing the cases where it had spoken of the right to marry as a fundamental right and said that “[i]t is not surprising that the decision to marry has been placed on the same level of importance as decisions relating to procreation, childbirth, child rearing, and family relationships.” The Court explained that “it would make little sense to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.”</p>
<p id="fc0a7d39-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the Court said that if the “right to procreate means anything at all, it must imply some right to enter the only relationship in which the State of Wisconsin allows sexual relations legally to take place.”</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court accepted the state’s claim that it had a substantial state interest in ensuring that child support was paid for minor children. But the Court found that the law was not sufficiently related to that end and thus concluded that it violated equal protection. The Court explained that the law prevented individuals who were unable to pay the owed child support from getting married, but “without delivering any money at all into the hands of the applicant’s prior children.” Also, the Court noted that the state had many alternative ways of ensuring that child support was paid that were less restrictive of the right to marry, such as through wage garnishment, civil contempt, and criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Stewart and Powell wrote separate concurring opinions in <i>Zablocki</i> and argued that the case should have been decided under due process rather than equal protection analysis. Although they would have used a different constitutional basis for finding the right to marry, their conclusion was the same: The law impermissibly interfered with the right to marry.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinions in <i>Zablocki</i> discuss two earlier cases, one of which, Boddie v. Connecticut, protected the right to marry, and the other, Califano v. Jobst, found that a state law did not interfere with that right. In Boddie v. Connecticut, <span title="911" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-911">p. 911</span>401 U.S. 371 (1971), the Court ruled that a state law requiring the payment of filing fees and court costs to receive a divorce violated indigent individuals’ due process rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Supreme Court observed, “As this Court on more than one occasion has recognized, marriage involves interests of basic importance in our society.” Obviously, preventing individuals from obtaining a divorce precludes them from exercising their right to marry someone else.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not every law that impacts on the right to marry has been declared unconstitutional. As explained above, the Supreme Court has said that there must be a direct and substantial interference with the right in order to trigger heightened scrutiny. In Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47 (1977), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a provision of the Social Security Act that terminated benefits for disabled children, who were covered as dependents of wage earners, at the time they got married. The law had an exception if a child married a person who also was entitled to benefits under the act.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court acknowledged that the termination of benefits might have an impact on a person’s desire to marry, but the Court said that a “general rule is not rendered invalid simply because some persons who might otherwise have married were deterred by the rule or because some who did marry were burdened thereby.” The Court unanimously concluded that it was permissible for Congress to assume that “a married person is less likely to be dependent on his parents for support than one who is unmarried.”</p>
<p id="fc0a7d3f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Bowen v. Owens, 476 U.S. 340 (1986), the Court rejected a challenge to another provision of the Social Security Act. The act provided survivor benefits from a wage earner’s account to a widowed spouse who remarried after age 60 but denied such benefits to a similarly situated divorced widowed spouse. The law in essence created a divorce penalty allowing nondivorced widowed spouses to continue to receive benefits but denying continuing benefits to divorced spouses who remarried.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d40-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that “it was rational for Congress to assume that divorced widowed spouses are generally less dependent upon the resources of their former spouses than are widows and widowers.” Thus, “[p]resumably Congress concluded that remarriage sufficiently reduced that lesser dependency to the point where it could conclude that benefits no longer were appropriate.”</p>
<p id="fc0a7d41-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Califano v. Jobst and Bowen v. Owens reflect the principle that a right is not violated unless there has been a direct and substantial interference. Also, cases such as <i>Califano</i> and <i>Bowen</i> undoubtedly are, in part, about judicial deference to legislative decisions about how to allocate scarce funds in a program such as Social Security. Lines inevitably must be drawn, and the Court is understandably reluctant to second-guess the legislature unless there is discrimination against a suspect class or a clear infringement of a fundamental right. These cases, however, in no way deny that the right to marry is regarded as a fundamental right and that generally the government must meet strict scrutiny before interfering with this basic liberty.</p>
<p id="fc0a7d42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The scope of the right to marry came before the Court in two recent cases concerning marriage equality for gays and lesbians. In United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013), the Court declared unconstitutional as denying equal protection Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which provided that for federal law purposes marriage must be between a man and a woman. Section 3 of DOMA stated:</p>

<p id="fc0a7d43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="912" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-912">p. 912</span>In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word “marriage” means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.</p>
</div>
<p id="fc0a7d44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, in a 5-4 decision, emphasized that traditionally marriage has been regulated by the states: “In order to assess the validity of that intervention it is necessary to discuss the extent of the state power and authority over marriage as a matter of history and tradition. State laws defining and regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons, but, subject to those guarantees, ‘regulation of domestic relations’ is ‘an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States.’ . . . Here the State’s decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import. When the State used its historic and essential authority to define the marital relation in this way, its role and its power in making the decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the class in their own community. DOMA, because of its reach and extent, departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage. ‘[D]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional provision.’”</p>
<p id="fc0aa455-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concluded that DOMA violated due process and equal protection:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc0aa456-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect. By doing so it violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government. The Constitution’s guarantee of equality “must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot” justify disparate treatment of that group. In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or purpose, “‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’” especially require careful consideration. DOMA cannot survive under these principles. The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.</p>
<p id="fc0aa457-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of DOMA’s enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence. The House Report announced its conclusion that “it is both appropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can to defend the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage. . . . H.R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the ‘Defense of Marriage Act.’ The effort to redefine ‘marriage’ to extend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that would fundamentally alter the institution of marriage.” The House concluded that DOMA expresses “both moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality.” The stated purpose of the law was to promote an “interest in protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in heterosexual-only marriage laws.” Were there any doubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act confirms it: The Defense of Marriage.</p>
<p id="fc0aa458-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act’s demonstrated purpose is to ensure that if any State decides to recognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated as second-class marriages for purposes of federal law. This raises a most serious question under the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc0aa459-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="913" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-913">p. 913</span>Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible and public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound.</p>
<p id="fc0aa45a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What has been explained to this point should more than suffice to establish that the principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex marriage. This requires the Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
</div>

<p id="fc0aa45b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Roberts wrote a dissent and said that “Interests in uniformity and stability amply justified Congress’s decision to retain the definition of marriage that, at that point, had been adopted by every State in our Nation, and every nation in the world. The majority sees a more sinister motive, pointing out that the Federal Government has generally (though not uniformly) deferred to state definitions of marriage in the past. At least without some more convincing evidence that the Act’s principal purpose was to codify malice, and that it furthered no legitimate government interests, I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry.”</p>
<p id="fc0aa45c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Scalia dissented and declared:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc0aa45d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to pronounce the law. Today’s opinion aggrandizes the latter, with the predictable consequence of diminishing the former. We have no power to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. The Court’s errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in America.</p>
<p id="fc0aa45e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As I have observed before, the Constitution does not forbid the government to enforce traditional moral and sexual norms. I will not swell the U.S. Reports with restatements of that point. It is enough to say that the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our society to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it neither requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce, polygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.</p>
<p id="fc0aa45f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, even setting aside traditional moral disapproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex), there are many perfectly valid—indeed, downright boring—justifying rationales for this legislation. Their existence ought to be the end of this case. To choose just one of these defenders’ arguments, DOMA avoids difficult choice-of-law issues that will now arise absent a uniform federal definition of marriage. Imagine a pair of women who marry in Albany and then move to Alabama, which does not “recognize as valid any marriage of parties of the same sex.” When the couple files their next federal tax return, may it be a joint one? Which State’s law controls, for federal-law purposes: their State of celebration (which recognizes the marriage) or their State of domicile (which does not)? (Does the answer depend on whether they were just visiting in Albany?) Are these questions to be answered as a matter of federal common law, or perhaps by borrowing a State’s choice-of-law rules? If so, which State’s? And what about States where the status of an out-of-state same-sex marriage is an unsettled question under local law? DOMA avoided all of this uncertainty by specifying which marriages would be recognized for federal purposes. That is a classic purpose for a definitional provision.</p>
<p id="fc0aa460-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the majority’s telling, this story is black-and-white: Hate your neighbor or come along with us. The truth is more complicated. It is hard to admit that one’s political opponents are not monsters, especially in a struggle like this one, and <span title="914" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-914">p. 914</span>the challenge in the end proves more than today’s Court can handle. Too bad. A reminder that disagreement over something so fundamental as marriage can still be politically legitimate would have been a fit task for what in earlier times was called the judicial temperament. We might have covered ourselves with honor today, by promising all sides of this debate that it was theirs to settle and that we would respect their resolution. We might have let the People decide.</p>
<p id="fc0aa461-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that the majority will not do. Some will rejoice in today’s decision, and some will despair at it; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many. But the Court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat. We owed both of them better. I dissent.</p>
</div>


<p id="fc0aa462-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Alito also dissented and wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc0aa463-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our Nation is engaged in a heated debate about same-sex marriage. That debate is, at bottom, about the nature of the institution of marriage. Respondent Edith Windsor, supported by the United States, asks this Court to intervene in that debate, and although she couches her argument in different terms, what she seeks is a holding that enshrines in the Constitution a particular understanding of marriage under which the sex of the partners makes no difference. The Constitution, however, does not dictate that choice. It leaves the choice to the people, acting through their elected representatives at both the federal and state levels. I would therefore hold that Congress did not violate Windsor’s constitutional rights by enacting §3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines the meaning of marriage under federal statutes that either confer upon married persons certain federal benefits or impose upon them certain federal obligations.</p>
<p id="fc0aa464-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same-sex marriage presents a highly emotional and important question of public policy—but not a difficult question of constitutional law. The Constitution does not guarantee the right to enter into a same-sex marriage. Indeed, no provision of the Constitution speaks to the issue.</p>
<p id="fc0aa465-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has sometimes found the Due Process Clauses to have a substantive component that guarantees liberties beyond the absence of physical restraint. And the Court’s holding that “DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution” suggests that substantive due process may partially underlie the Court’s decision today. But it is well established that any “substantive” component to the Due Process Clause protects only “those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.’”</p>
<p id="fc0aa466-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition. In this country, no State permitted same-sex marriage until the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held in 2003 that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the State Constitution. Nor is the right to same-sex marriage deeply rooted in the traditions of other nations. No country allowed same-sex couples to marry until the Netherlands did so in 2000.</p>
<p id="fc0aa467-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What Windsor and the United States seek, therefore, is not the protection of a deeply rooted right but the recognition of a very new right, and they seek this innovation not from a legislative body elected by the people, but from unelected judges. Faced with such a request, judges have cause for both caution and humility.</p>
<p id="fc0aa468-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At present, no one—including social scientists, philosophers, and historians—can predict with any certainty what the long-term ramifications of widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage will be. And judges are certainly not equipped to make such an assessment. The Members of this Court have the authority and the responsibility to interpret and apply the Constitution. Thus, if the Constitution contained a provision guaranteeing the right to marry a person <span title="915" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-915">p. 915</span>of the same sex, it would be our duty to enforce that right. But the Constitution simply does not speak to the issue of same-sex marriage. In our system of government, ultimate sovereignty rests with the people, and the people have the right to control their own destiny. Any change on a question so fundamental should be made by the people through their elected officials.</p>

<p id="fc0acb85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before addressing the principles and precedents that govern these cases, it is appropriate to note the history of the subject now before the Court.</p>
<p id="fc0acb86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From their beginning to their most recent page, the annals of human history reveal the transcendent importance of marriage. The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations.</p>
<p id="fc0acb87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The centrality of marriage to the human condition makes it unsurprising that the institution has existed for millennia and across civilizations. Since the dawn of history, marriage has transformed strangers into relatives, binding <span title="916" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-916">p. 916</span>families and societies together. It is fair and necessary to say these references were based on the understanding that marriage is a union between two persons of the opposite sex.</p>
<p id="fc0acb88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That history is the beginning of these cases. The respondents say it should be the end as well. To them, it would demean a timeless institution if the concept and lawful status of marriage were extended to two persons of the same sex. Marriage, in their view, is by its nature a gender-differentiated union of man and woman. This view long has been held—and continues to be held—in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.</p>
<p id="fc0acb89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioners acknowledge this history but contend that these cases cannot end there. Far from seeking to devalue marriage, the petitioners seek it for themselves because of their respect—and need—for its privileges and responsibilities. And their immutable nature dictates that same-sex marriage is their only real path to this profound commitment.</p>
<p id="fc0acb8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner James Obergefell, a plaintiff in the Ohio case, met John Arthur over two decades ago. They fell in love and started a life together, establishing a lasting, committed relation. In 2011, however, Arthur was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. This debilitating disease is progressive, with no known cure. Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided to commit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthur died. To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled from Ohio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. It was difficult for Arthur to move, and so the couple were wed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on the tarmac in Baltimore. Three months later, Arthur died. Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate. By statute, they must remain strangers even in death, a state-imposed separation Obergefell deems “hurtful for the rest of time.” He brought suit to be shown as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate.</p>
<p id="fc0acb8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution—even as confined to opposite-sex relations—has evolved over time.</p>
<p id="fc0acb8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These new insights have strengthened, not weakened, the institution of marriage. Indeed, changed understandings of marriage are characteristic of a Nation where new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new generations, often through perspectives that begin in pleas or protests and then are considered in the political sphere and the judicial process.</p>
<p id="fc0acb8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This dynamic can be seen in the Nation’s experiences with the rights of gays and lesbians. Until the mid-20th century, same-sex intimacy long had been condemned as immoral by the state itself in most Western nations, a belief often embodied in the criminal law. For this reason, among others, many persons did not deem homosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity. A truthful declaration by same-sex couples of what was in their hearts had to remain unspoken. Even when a greater awareness of the humanity and integrity of homosexual persons came in the period after World War II, the argument that gays and lesbians had a just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread social conventions. Same-sex intimacy remained a crime in many States. Gays and lesbians were prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate.</p>

When the American Psychiatric Association published the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952, homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, a position adhered to until 1973. Only in more recent years have psychiatrists and others recognized that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable.</p>

<p id="fc0af2a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In addition these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The identification and protection of fundamental rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret the Constitution. That responsibility, however, “has not been reduced to any formula.” Poe v. Ullman (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Rather, it requires courts to exercise reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord them its respect. That process is guided by many of the same considerations relevant to analysis of other constitutional provisions that set forth broad principles rather than specific requirements. History and tradition guide and discipline this inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries. That method respects our history and learns from it without allowing the past alone to rule the present.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these established tenets, the Court has long held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. In Loving v. Virginia (1967), which invalidated bans on interracial unions, a unanimous Court held marriage is “one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” The Court reaffirmed that holding in Zablocki v. Redhail (1978), which held the right to marry was burdened by a law prohibiting fathers who were behind on child support from marrying. The Court again applied this principle in Turner v. Safley (1987), which held the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry. Over time and in other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be denied that this Court’s cases describing the right to marry presumed a relationship involving opposite-sex partners. The Court, like many institutions, has made assumptions defined by the world and time of which it is a part.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still, there are other, more instructive precedents. This Court’s cases have expressed constitutional principles of broader reach. In defining the right to <span title="918" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-918">p. 918</span>marry these cases have identified essential attributes of that right based in history, tradition, and other constitutional liberties inherent in this intimate bond. And in assessing whether the force and rationale of its cases apply to same-sex couples, the Court must respect the basic reasons why the right to marry has been long protected.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This analysis compels the conclusion that same-sex couples may exercise the right to marry. The four principles and traditions to be discussed demonstrate that the reasons marriage is fundamental under the Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A first premise of the Court’s relevant precedents is that the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy. This abiding connection between marriage and liberty is why Like choices concerning contraception, family relationships, procreation, and childrearing, all of which are protected by the Constitution, decisions concerning marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make. Indeed, the Court has noted it would be contradictory “to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.”</p>
<p id="fc0af2a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Choices about marriage shape an individual’s destiny. The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation. There is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound choices.</p>
<p id="fc0af2a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second principle in this Court’s jurisprudence is that the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals. This point was central to Griswold v. Connecticut [1965], which held the Constitution protects the right of married couples to use contraception.</p>
<p id="fc0af2aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there. It offers the hope of companionship and understanding and assurance that while both still live there will be someone to care for the other.</p>
<p id="fc0af2ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As this Court held in <i>Lawrence,</i> same-sex couples have the same right as opposite-sex couples to enjoy intimate association. <i>Lawrence</i> invalidated laws that made same-sex intimacy a criminal act. But while <i>Lawrence</i> confirmed a dimension of freedom that allows individuals to engage in intimate association without criminal liability, it does not follow that freedom stops there. Outlaw to outcast may be a step forward, but it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.</p>
<p id="fc0af2ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that it safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education. By giving recognition and legal structure to their parents’ relationship, marriage allows children “to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.” Marriage also affords the permanency and stability important to children’s best interests.</p>
<p id="fc0af2ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As all parties agree, many same-sex couples provide loving and nurturing homes to their children, whether biological or adopted. And hundreds of thousands of children are presently being raised by such couples. Most States have allowed gays and lesbians to adopt, either as individuals or as couples, and many <span title="919" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-919">p. 919</span>adopted and foster children have same-sex parents. This provides powerful confirmation from the law itself that gays and lesbians can create loving, supportive families.</p>
<p id="fc0af2ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Excluding same-sex couples from marriage thus conflicts with a central premise of the right to marry. Without the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, their children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser. They also suffer the significant material costs of being raised by unmarried parents, relegated through no fault of their own to a more difficult and uncertain family life. The marriage laws at issue here thus harm and humiliate the children of same-sex couples.</p>
<p id="fc0b19bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is not to say the right to marry is less meaningful for those who do not or cannot have children. An ability, desire, or promise to procreate is not and has not been a prerequisite for a valid marriage in any State. In light of precedent protecting the right of a married couple not to procreate, it cannot be said the Court or the States have conditioned the right to marry on the capacity or commitment to procreate. The constitutional marriage right has many aspects, of which childbearing is only one.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth and finally, this Court’s cases and the Nation’s traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of our social order. For that reason, just as a couple vows to support each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition and material benefits to protect and nourish the union. Indeed, while the States are in general free to vary the benefits they confer on all married couples, they have throughout our history made marriage the basis for an expanding list of governmental rights, benefits, and responsibilities. These aspects of marital status include: taxation; inheritance and property rights; rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege in the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decisionmaking authority; adoption rights; the rights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates; professional ethics rules; campaign finance restrictions; workers’ compensation benefits; health insurance; and child custody, support, and visitation rules.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle. Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation’s society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek fulfillment in its highest meaning.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest. With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification and new groups could not invoke rights once denied. This Court has rejected that approach, both with respect to the right to marry and the rights of gays and lesbians.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="920" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-920">p. 920</span>The right of same-sex couples to marry that is part of the liberty promised by the Fourteenth Amendment is derived, too, from that Amendment’s guarantee of the equal protection of the laws. It is now clear that the challenged laws burden the liberty of same-sex couples, and it must be further acknowledged that they abridge central precepts of equality. Here the marriage laws enforced by the respondents are in essence unequal: same-sex couples are denied all the benefits afforded to opposite-sex couples and are barred from exercising a fundamental right. Especially against a long history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm. The imposition of this disability on gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them. And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the fundamental right to marry.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them.</p>

<p id="fc0b19c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There may be an initial inclination in these cases to proceed with caution—to await further legislation, litigation, and debate. Yet there has been far more deliberation than this argument acknowledges. There have been referenda, legislative debates, and grassroots campaigns, as well as countless studies, papers, books, and other popular and scholarly writings. There has been extensive litigation in state and federal courts.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.</p>
<p id="fc0b19c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right. The Nation’s courts are open to injured individuals who come to them to vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic charter. An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act.</p>
<p id="fc0b19ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same-sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex.</p>
<p id="fc0b19cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="921" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-921">p. 921</span>No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.</p>

<p id="fc0b19cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners make strong arguments rooted in social policy and considerations of fairness. They contend that same-sex couples should be allowed to affirm their love and commitment through marriage, just like opposite-sex couples. That position has undeniable appeal; over the past six years, voters and legislators in eleven States and the District of Columbia have revised their laws to allow marriage between two people of the same sex.</p>
<p id="fc0b19ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But this Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be.</p>
<p id="fc0b19cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State’s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.</p>
<p id="fc0b19d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority’s approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.</p>
<p id="fc0b40e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s decision is an act of will, not legal judgment. The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this Court’s precedent. The majority expressly disclaims judicial “caution” and omits even a pretense of humility, openly relying on its desire to remake society according to its own “new insight” into the “nature of injustice.” As a result, the Court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the States and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs. Just who do we think we are?</p>
<p id="fc0b40e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="922" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-922">p. 922</span>It can be tempting for judges to confuse our own preferences with the requirements of the law. But as this Court has been reminded throughout our history, the Constitution “is made for people of fundamentally differing views.” Lochner v. New York (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Accordingly, “courts are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of legislation.” The majority today neglects that restrained conception of the judicial role. It seizes for itself a question the Constitution leaves to the people, at a time when the people are engaged in a vibrant debate on that question. And it answers that question based not on neutral principles of constitutional law, but on its own “understanding of what freedom is and must become.” I have no choice but to dissent.</p>
<p id="fc0b40e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.</p>
<p id="fc0b40e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is striking how much of the majority’s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage. If “[t]here is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound choices,” why would there be any less dignity in the bond between three people who, in exercising their autonomy, seek to make the profound choice to marry? If a same-sex couple has the constitutional right to marry because their children would otherwise “suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser,” why wouldn’t the same reasoning apply to a family of three or more persons raising children? If not having the opportunity to marry “serves to disrespect and subordinate” gay and lesbian couples, why wouldn’t the same “imposition of this disability,” serve to disrespect and subordinate people who find fulfillment in polyamorous relationships?</p>
<p id="fc0b40e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not mean to equate marriage between same-sex couples with plural marriages in all respects. There may well be relevant differences that compel different legal analysis. But if there are, petitioners have not pointed to any. When asked about a plural marital union at oral argument, petitioners asserted that a State “doesn’t have such an institution.” But that is exactly the point: the States at issue here do not have an institution of same-sex marriage, either.</p>
<p id="fc0b40e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s understanding of due process lays out a tantalizing vision of the future for Members of this Court: If an unvarying social institution enduring over all of recorded history cannot inhibit judicial policymaking, what can? But this approach is dangerous for the rule of law. The purpose of insisting that implied fundamental rights have roots in the history and tradition of our people is to ensure that when unelected judges strike down democratically enacted laws, they do so based on something more than their own beliefs. The Court today not only overlooks our country’s entire history and tradition but actively repudiates it, preferring to live only in the heady days of the here and now. I agree with the majority that the “nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times.” As petitioners put it, “times can blind.” But to blind yourself to history is both prideful and unwise. “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” W. Faulkner, Requiem for a Nun 92 (1951).</p>

<p id="fc0b40eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who founded our country would not recognize the majority’s conception of the judicial role. They after all risked their lives and fortunes for the precious right to govern themselves. They would never have imagined yielding that right on a question of social policy to unaccountable and unelected judges. And they certainly would not have been satisfied by a system empowering judges to override policy judgments so long as they do so after “a quite extensive discussion.” In our democracy, debate about the content of the law is not an exhaustion requirement to be checked off before courts can impose their will.</p>
<p id="fc0b40ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s accumulation of power does not occur in a vacuum. It comes at the expense of the people. And they know it. Here and abroad, people are in the midst of a serious and thoughtful public debate on the issue of same-sex marriage. They see voters carefully considering same-sex marriage, casting ballots in favor or opposed, and sometimes changing their minds. They see political leaders similarly reexamining their positions, and either reversing course or explaining adherence to old convictions confirmed anew. They see governments and businesses modifying policies and practices with respect to same-sex couples, and participating actively in the civic discourse. They see countries overseas democratically accepting profound social change, or declining to do so. This deliberative process is making people take seriously questions that they may not have even regarded as questions before.</p>
<p id="fc0b40ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are—in the tradition of our political culture—reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. In addition, they can gear up to raise the issue later, hoping to persuade enough on the winning side to think again. “That is exactly how our system of government is supposed to work.”</p>
<p id="fc0b40ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide. As a thoughtful commentator observed about another issue, “The political process was moving . . ., not swiftly enough for advocates of quick, complete change, <span title="924" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-924">p. 924</span>but majoritarian institutions were listening and acting. Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.” Ginsburg, Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to Roe v. Wade, 63 N.C. L. Rev. 375, 385-386 (1985). Indeed, however heartened the proponents of same-sex marriage might be on this day, it is worth acknowledging what they have lost, and lost forever: the opportunity to win the true acceptance that comes from persuading their fellow citizens of the justice of their cause. And they lose this just when the winds of change were freshening at their backs.</p>
<p id="fc0b40ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal courts are blunt instruments when it comes to creating rights. They have constitutional power only to resolve concrete cases or controversies; they do not have the flexibility of legislatures to address concerns of parties not before the court or to anticipate problems that may arise from the exercise of a new right. Today’s decision, for example, creates serious questions about religious liberty. Many good and decent people oppose same-sex marriage as a tenet of faith, and their freedom to exercise religion is—unlike the right imagined by the majority—actually spelled out in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc0b40f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respect for sincere religious conviction has led voters and legislators in every State that has adopted same-sex marriage democratically to include accommodations for religious practice. The majority’s decision imposing same-sex marriage cannot, of course, create any such accommodations. The majority graciously suggests that religious believers may continue to “advocate” and “teach” their views of marriage. The First Amendment guarantees, however, the freedom to “<i>exercise”</i> religion. Ominously, that is not a word the majority uses.</p>
<p id="fc0b40f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision.

The law can recognize as marriage whatever sexual attachments and living arrangements it wishes, and can accord them favorable civil consequences, from tax treatment to rights of inheritance. Those civil consequences—and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences—can perhaps have adverse social effects, but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws. So it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today’s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact—and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court’s claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention. This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.</p>

Individuals on both sides of the issue passionately, but respectfully, attempted to persuade their fellow citizens to accept their views. Americans considered the arguments and put the question to a vote. The electorates of 11 States, either directly or through their representatives, chose to expand the traditional definition of marriage. Many more decided not to. Win or lose, advocates for both sides continued pressing their cases, secure in the knowledge that an electoral loss can be negated by a later electoral win. That is exactly how our system of government is supposed to work.</p>
<p id="fc0b6807-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution places some constraints on self-rule—constraints adopted <i>by the People themselves</i> when they ratified the Constitution and its Amendments. These cases ask us to decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment contains a limitation that requires the States to license and recognize marriages between two people of the same sex. Does it remove <i>that</i> issue from the political process?</p>
<p id="fc0b6808-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course not. It would be surprising to find a prescription regarding marriage in the Federal Constitution since, as the author of today’s opinion reminded us only two years ago (in an opinion joined by the same Justices who join him today): “[R]egulation of domestic relations is an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States.” “[T]he Federal Government, through our history, has deferred to state-law policy decisions with respect to domestic relations.”</p>
<p id="fc0b6809-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we need not speculate. When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868, every State limited marriage to one man and one woman, and no one doubted the constitutionality of doing so. That resolves these cases. We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification. Since there is no doubt whatever that the People never decided to prohibit the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples, the public debate over same-sex marriage must be allowed to continue.</p>
<p id="fc0b680a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court ends this debate, in an opinion lacking even a thin veneer of law. Buried beneath the mummeries and straining-to-be-memorable passages of the opinion is a candid and startling assertion: No matter <i>what</i> it was the People ratified, the Fourteenth Amendment protects those rights that the Judiciary, in its “reasoned judgment,” thinks the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect.</p>
<p id="fc0b680b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a naked judicial claim to legislative—indeed, <i>super-</i>legislative—power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government. Except as limited by a constitutional prohibition agreed to by the People, the States are free to adopt whatever laws they like, even those that offend the esteemed Justices’ “reasoned judgment.” A system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.</p>

They have discovered in the Fourteenth Amendment a “fundamental right” overlooked by every person alive at the time of ratification, and almost everyone else in the time since. They see what lesser legal minds—minds like Thomas Cooley, John Marshall Harlan, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Learned Hand, Louis Brandeis, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Cardozo, Hugo Black, Felix Frankfurter, Robert Jackson, and Henry Friendly—could not.</p>

The Judiciary is the “least dangerous” of the federal branches because it has “neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm” and the States, “even for the efficacy of its judgments.” With each decision of ours that takes from the People a question properly left to them—with each decision that is unabashedly based not on law, but on the “reasoned judgment” of a bare majority of this Court—we move one step closer to being reminded of our impotence.</p>

<p id="fc0b6810-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decision today is at odds not only with the Constitution, but with the principles upon which our Nation was built. Since well before 1787, liberty has been understood as freedom from government action, not entitlement to government benefits. The Framers created our Constitution to preserve that understanding of liberty. Yet the majority invokes our Constitution in the name of a “liberty” that the Framers would not have recognized, to the detriment of the liberty they sought to protect. Along the way, it rejects the idea—captured in our Declaration of Independence—that human dignity is innate and suggests instead that it comes from the Government. This distortion of our Constitution not only ignores the text, it inverts the relationship between the individual and the state in our Republic. I cannot agree with it.</p>
<p id="fc0b6811-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s decision today will require States to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages entered in other States largely based on a constitutional provision guaranteeing “due process” before a person is deprived of his “life, liberty, or property.” I have elsewhere explained the dangerous fiction of treating the Due Process Clause as a font of substantive rights. It distorts the constitutional text, which guarantees only whatever “process” is “due” before a person is deprived of life, liberty, and property. Worse, it invites judges to do exactly what the majority has done here—“‘roa[m] at large in the constitutional field’ guided only by their personal views” as to the “‘fundamental rights’” protected by that document.</p>
<p id="fc0b6812-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By straying from the text of the Constitution, substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. But the result petitioners seek is far less democratic. They ask nine judges on this Court to enshrine their definition of marriage in the Federal Constitution and thus put it beyond the reach of the normal democratic process for the entire Nation. That a “bare majority” of this Court, is able to grant this wish, wiping out with a stroke of the keyboard the results of the political process in over 30 States, based on a provision that guarantees only “due process” is but further evidence of the danger of substantive due process.</p>
<p id="fc0b6813-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="927" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-927">p. 927</span>Even if the doctrine of substantive due process were somehow defensible—it is not—petitioners still would not have a claim. To invoke the protection of the Due Process Clause at all—whether under a theory of “substantive” or “procedural” due process—a party must first identify a deprivation of “life, liberty, or property.” The majority claims these state laws deprive petitioners of “liberty,” but the concept of “liberty” it conjures up bears no resemblance to any plausible meaning of that word as it is used in the Due Process Clauses.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming that the “liberty” in those Clauses encompasses something more than freedom from physical restraint, it would not include the types of rights claimed by the majority. In the American legal tradition, liberty has long been understood as individual freedom <i>from</i> governmental action, not as a right <i>to</i> a particular governmental entitlement.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether we define “liberty” as locomotion or freedom from governmental action more broadly, petitioners have in no way been deprived of it. Petitioners cannot claim, under the most plausible definition of “liberty,” that they have been imprisoned or physically restrained by the States for participating in same-sex relationships. To the contrary, they have been able to cohabitate and raise their children in peace. They have been able to hold civil marriage ceremonies in States that recognize same-sex marriages and private religious ceremonies in all States. They have been able to travel freely around the country, making their homes where they please. Far from being incarcerated or physically restrained, petitioners have been left alone to order their lives as they see fit.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor, under the broader definition, can they claim that the States have restricted their ability to go about their daily lives as they would be able to absent governmental restrictions. Petitioners do not ask this Court to order the States to stop restricting their ability to enter same-sex relationships, to engage in intimate behavior, to make vows to their partners in public ceremonies, to engage in religious wedding ceremonies, to hold themselves out as married, or to raise children. The States have imposed no such restrictions. Nor have the States prevented petitioners from approximating a number of incidents of marriage through private legal means, such as wills, trusts, and powers of attorney.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, the States have refused to grant them governmental entitlements. Petitioners claim that as a matter of “liberty,” they are entitled to access privileges and benefits that exist solely <i>because of</i> the government. They want, for example, to receive the State’s <i>imprimatur</i> on their marriages—on state issued marriage licenses, death certificates, or other official forms. And they want to receive various monetary benefits, including reduced inheritance taxes upon the death of a spouse, compensation if a spouse dies as a result of a work-related injury, or loss of consortium damages in tort suits. But receiving governmental recognition and benefits has nothing to do with any understanding of “liberty” that the Framers would have recognized.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our Constitution—like the Declaration of Independence before it—was predicated on a simple truth: One’s liberty, not to mention one’s dignity, was something to be shielded from—not provided by—the State. Today’s decision casts that truth aside. In its haste to reach a desired result, the majority misapplies a clause focused on “due process” to afford substantive rights, disregards the most plausible understanding of the “liberty” protected by that clause, and distorts the principles on which this Nation was founded. Its decision will have inestimable consequences for our Constitution and our society. I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc0b8f2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until the federal courts intervened, the American people were engaged in a debate about whether their States should recognize same-sex marriage. The question in these cases, however, is not what States <i>should</i> do about same-sex marriage but whether the Constitution answers that question for them. It does not. The Constitution leaves that question to be decided by the people of each State.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term “liberty” in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right. To prevent five unelected Justices from imposing their personal vision of liberty upon the American people, the Court has held that “liberty” under the Due Process Clause should be understood to protect only those rights that are “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Washington v. Glucksberg (1997). And it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights. See United States v. Windsor (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="fc0b8f2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For today’s majority, it does not matter that the right to same-sex marriage lacks deep roots or even that it is contrary to long-established tradition. The Justices in the majority claim the authority to confer constitutional protection upon that right simply because they believe that it is fundamental.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attempting to circumvent the problem presented by the newness of the right found in these cases, the majority claims that the issue is the right to equal treatment. Noting that marriage is a fundamental right, the majority argues that a State has no valid reason for denying that right to same-sex couples. This reasoning is dependent upon a particular understanding of the purpose of civil marriage. This understanding of marriage, which focuses almost entirely on the happiness of persons who choose to marry, is shared by many people today, but it is not the traditional one. For millennia, marriage was inextricably linked to the one thing that only an opposite-sex couple can do: procreate.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision usurps the constitutional right of the people to decide whether to keep or alter the traditional understanding of marriage. The decision will also have other important consequences.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy. In the course of its opinion, the majority compares traditional marriage laws to laws that denied equal treatment for African-Americans and women. The implications of this analogy will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps recognizing how its reasoning may be used, the majority attempts, toward the end of its opinion, to reassure those who oppose same-sex marriage that their rights of conscience will be protected. We will soon see whether this proves to be true. I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The system of federalism established by our Constitution provides a way for people with different beliefs to live together in a single nation. If the issue of same-sex marriage had been left to the people of the States, it is likely that some States would recognize same-sex marriage and others would not. It is also possible that some States would tie recognition to protection for conscience rights. The majority today makes that impossible. By imposing <span title="929" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-929">p. 929</span>its own views on the entire country, the majority facilitates the marginalization of the many Americans who have traditional ideas. Recalling the harsh treatment of gays and lesbians in the past, some may think that turnabout is fair play. But if that sentiment prevails, the Nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision will also have a fundamental effect on this Court and its ability to uphold the rule of law. If a bare majority of Justices can invent a new right and impose that right on the rest of the country, the only real limit on what future majorities will be able to do is their own sense of what those with political power and cultural influence are willing to tolerate. Even enthusiastic supporters of same-sex marriage should worry about the scope of the power that today’s majority claims.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f33-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision shows that decades of attempts to restrain this Court’s abuse of its authority have failed. A lesson that some will take from today’s decision is that preaching about the proper method of interpreting the Constitution or the virtues of judicial self-restraint and humility cannot compete with the temptation to achieve what is viewed as a noble end by any practicable means. I do not doubt that my colleagues in the majority sincerely see in the Constitution a vision of liberty that happens to coincide with their own. But this sincerity is cause for concern, not comfort. What it evidences is the deep and perhaps irremediable corruption of our legal culture’s conception of constitutional interpretation.</p>
<p id="fc0b8f34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most Americans—understandably—will cheer or lament today’s decision because of their views on the issue of same-sex marriage. But all Americans, whatever their thinking on that issue, should worry about what the majority’s claim of power portends.</p>

The Court explained that “the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage ‘on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.’” The Court said that under Arkansas law, the state would not “issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State.” The Court said that was unconstitutional “[b]ecause that differential treatment infringes <i>Obergefell</i>’s commitment to provide same-sex couples ‘the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage.’”</p>

The Court has remarked that a “natural parent’s desire for and right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of <span title="930" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-930">p. 930</span>his or her children is an interest far more precious than any property right.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N104DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> The Court has made it clear that there must be a very substantial reason before parental custody can be terminated. The Court observed, “We have little doubt that the Due Process Clause would be offended ‘if a State were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family, over the objection of the parents and their children, without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children’s best interest.’”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104E1_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N104E1_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span></p>

<p id="fc0bb54d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">STANLEY v. ILLINOIS, 405 U.S. 645 (1972): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc0bb54e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joan Stanley lived with Peter Stanley intermittently for 18 years, during which time they had three children. When Joan Stanley died, Peter Stanley lost not only her but also his children. Under Illinois law, the children of unwed fathers become wards of the State upon the death of the mother. Accordingly, upon Joan Stanley’s death, in a dependency proceeding instituted by the State of Illinois, Stanley’s children were declared wards of the State and placed with court-appointed guardians. Stanley appealed, claiming that he had never been shown to be an unfit parent and that since married fathers and unwed mothers could not be deprived of their children without such a showing, he had been deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court accepted the fact that Stanley’s own unfitness had not been established but rejected the equal protection claim, holding that Stanley could properly be separated from his children upon proof of the single fact that he and the dead mother had not been married. Stanley’s actual fitness as a father was irrelevant. Stanley presses his equal protection claim here. The State continues to respond that unwed fathers are presumed unfit to raise their children and that it is unnecessary to hold individualized hearings to determine whether particular fathers are in fact unfit parents before they are separated from their children.</p>
<p id="fc0bb54f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has frequently emphasized the importance of the family. The rights to conceive and to raise one’s children have been deemed “essential,” Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), “basic civil rights of man,” Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson (1942), and “(r)ights far more precious . . . than property rights,” May v. Anderson (1953). “It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.” Prince v. Massachusetts (1944). The integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Ninth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc0bb550-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor has the law refused to recognize those family relationships unlegitimized by a marriage ceremony. The Court has declared unconstitutional a state statute denying natural, but illegitimate, children a wrongful-death action for the death of their mother, emphasizing that such children cannot be denied the right of other children because familial bonds in such cases were often as warm, enduring, and important as those arising within a more formally organized family unit. Levy v. Louisiana (1968). These authorities make it clear that, at the least, Stanley’s interest in retaining custody of his children is cognizable and substantial.</p>
<p id="fc0bb551-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="931" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-931">p. 931</span>We do not question the assertion that neglectful parents may be separated from their children. But we are here not asked to evaluate the legitimacy of the state ends, rather, to determine whether the means used to achieve these ends are constitutionally defensible. What is the state interest in separating children from fathers without a hearing designed to determine whether the father is unfit in a particular disputed case? We observe that the State registers no gain towards its declared goals when it separates children from the custody of fit parents. Indeed, if Stanley is a fit father, the State spites its own articulated goals when it needlessly separates him from his family.</p>
<p id="fc0bb552-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be, as the State insists, that most unmarried fathers are unsuitable and neglectful parents. It may also be that Stanley is such a parent and that his children should be placed in other hands. But all unmarried fathers are not in this category; some are wholly suited to have custody of their children. This much the State readily concedes, and nothing in this record indicates that Stanley is or has been a neglectful father who has not cared for his children. Given the opportunity to make his case, Stanley may have been seen to be deserving of custody of his offspring. Had this been so, the State’s statutory policy would have been furthered by leaving custody in him.</p>
<p id="fc0bb553-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedure by presumption is always cheaper and easier than individualized determination. But when, as here, the procedure forecloses the determinative issues of competence and care, when it explicitly disdains present realities in deference to past formalities, it needlessly risks running roughshod over the important interests of both parent and child. It therefore cannot stand.</p>

<p id="fc0bdc65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other cases, however, the Supreme Court has ruled that the government can terminate the rights of unmarried fathers without being required to provide due process. Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983), involved a nonmarital father who had not supported his two-year-old child and had not registered his interest in paternity in a putative father’s registry maintained by the state. The Supreme Court held that the state could terminate the father’s parental rights without providing notice or a hearing.</p>
<p id="fc0bdc66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court distinguished <i>Stanley</i> because in that case the father had been actively involved in his children’s lives. The Court observed, “When an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by coming forward to participate in the rearing of his child, his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the due process clause. . . . But the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection.”</p>

The presumption of legitimacy may be rebutted only by the husband or wife, and then only in limited circumstances. The instant appeal presents the claim that this presumption infringes upon the due process rights of a man who wishes to establish his paternity of a child born to the wife of another man, and the claim that it infringes upon the constitutional right of the child to maintain a relationship with her natural father.</p>

<p id="fc0bdc70-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of this case are, we must hope, extraordinary. On May 9, 1976, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Carole D., an international model, and Gerald D., a top executive in a French oil company, were married. The couple established a home in Playa del Rey, California, in which they resided as husband and wife when one or the other was not out of the country on business. In the summer of 1978, Carole became involved in an adulterous affair with a neighbor, Michael H. In September 1980, she conceived a child, Victoria D., who was born on May 11, 1981. Gerald was listed as father on the birth certificate and has always held Victoria out to the world as his daughter. Soon after delivery of the child, however, Carole informed Michael that she believed he might be the father.</p>
<p id="fc0bdc71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first three years of her life, Victoria remained always with Carole, but found herself within a variety of quasi-family units. In October 1981, Gerald moved to New York City to pursue his business interests, but Carole chose to remain in California. At the end of that month, Carole and Michael had blood tests of themselves and Victoria, which showed a 98.07% probability that Michael was Victoria’s father. In January 1982, Carole visited Michael in St. Thomas, where his primary business interests were based. There Michael held Victoria out as his child. In March, however, Carole left Michael and returned to California, where she took up residence with yet another man, Scott K. Later that spring, and again in the summer, Carole and Victoria spent time with Gerald in New York City, as well as on vacation in Europe. In the fall, they returned to Scott in California.</p>
<p id="fc0bdc72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 1982, rebuffed in his attempts to visit Victoria, Michael filed a filiation action in California Superior Court to establish his paternity and right to visitation. In March 1983, the court appointed an attorney and guardian ad litem to represent Victoria’s interests. Victoria then filed a cross-complaint asserting that if she had more than one psychological or de facto father, she was entitled to maintain her filial relationship, with all of the attendant rights, duties, and obligations, with both.</p>
<p id="fc0c0383-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 1983, Carole filed a motion for summary judgment. During this period, from March through July 1983, Carole was again living with Gerald in New York. In August, however, she returned to California, became involved once again with Michael, and instructed her attorneys to remove the summary judgment motion from the calendar. For the ensuing eight months, when Michael was not in St. Thomas he lived with Carole and Victoria in Carole’s apartment in Los Angeles and held Victoria out as his daughter. In April 1984, Carole and Michael signed a stipulation that Michael was Victoria’s natural father. Carole left Michael the next month, however, and instructed her attorneys not to file the stipulation. In June 1984, Carole reconciled with Gerald and joined him in <span title="933" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-933">p. 933</span>New York, where they now live with Victoria and two other children since born into the marriage.</p>
<p id="fc0c0384-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 1984, Michael and Victoria, through her guardian ad litem, sought visitation rights for Michael. To assist in determining whether visitation would be in Victoria’s best interests, the Superior Court appointed a psychologist to evaluate Victoria, Gerald, Michael, and Carole. The psychologist recommended that Carole retain sole custody, but that Michael be allowed continued contact with Victoria pursuant to a restricted visitation schedule.</p>
<p id="fc0c0385-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 19, 1984, Gerald, who had intervened in the action, moved for summary judgment on the ground that under Cal. Evid. Code §621 there were no triable issues of fact as to Victoria’s paternity. This law provides that “the issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband, who is not impotent or sterile, is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.” The presumption may be rebutted by blood tests, but only if a motion for such tests is made, within two years from the date of the child’s birth, either by the husband or, if the natural father has filed an affidavit acknowledging paternity, by the wife.</p>
<p id="fc0c0386-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 28, 1985, having found that affidavits submitted by Carole and Gerald sufficed to demonstrate that the two were cohabiting at conception and birth and that Gerald was neither sterile nor impotent, the Superior Court granted Gerald’s motion for summary judgment, rejecting Michael’s and Victoria’s challenges to the constitutionality of §621. The court also denied their motions for continued visitation.</p>

<p id="fc0c0388-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We address first the claims of Michael. At the outset, it is necessary to clarify what he sought and what he was denied. California law, like nature itself, makes no provision for dual fatherhood. Michael was seeking to be declared the father of Victoria. The immediate benefit he evidently sought to obtain from that status was visitation rights. But if Michael were successful in being declared the father, other rights would follow—most importantly, the right to be considered as the parent who should have custody, a status which “embrace[s] the sum of parental rights with respect to the rearing of a child, including the child’s care; the right to the child’s services and earnings; the right to direct the child’s activities; the right to make decisions regarding the control, education, and health of the child; and the right, as well as the duty, to prepare the child for additional obligations, which includes the teaching of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good citizenship.”</p>
<p id="fc0c0389-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Michael contends as a matter of substantive due process that, because he has established a parental relationship with Victoria, protection of Gerald’s and Carole’s marital union is an insufficient state interest to support termination of that relationship. This argument is, of course, predicated on the assertion that Michael has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his relationship with Victoria.</p>
<p id="fc0c038a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is an established part of our constitutional jurisprudence that the term “liberty” in the Due Process Clause extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. Without that core textual meaning as a limitation, defining the scope of the Due Process Clause “has at times been a treacherous field for this Court,” giving <span title="934" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-934">p. 934</span>“reason for concern lest the only limits to . . . judicial intervention become the predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court.”</p>
<p id="fc0c038b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an attempt to limit and guide interpretation of the Clause, we have insisted not merely that the interest denominated as a “liberty” be “fundamental” (a concept that, in isolation, is hard to objectify), but also that it be an interest traditionally protected by our society. As we have put it, the Due Process Clause affords only those protections “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” Snyder v. Massachusetts (1934) (Cardozo, J.). Our cases reflect “continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history [and] solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society. . . .” Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p id="fc0c038c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This insistence that the asserted liberty interest be rooted in history and tradition is evident, as elsewhere, in our cases according constitutional protection to certain parental rights. Michael reads the landmark case of Stanley v. Illinois (1972), and the subsequent cases as establishing that a liberty interest is created by biological fatherhood plus an established parental relationship—factors that exist in the present case as well. We think that distorts the rationale of those cases. As we view them, they rest not upon such isolated factors but upon the historic respect—indeed, sanctity would not be too strong a term—traditionally accorded to the relationships that develop within the unitary family.</p>
<p id="fc0c038d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the legal issue in the present case reduces to whether the relationship between persons in the situation of Michael and Victoria has been treated as a protected family unit under the historic practices of our society, or whether on any other basis it has been accorded special protection. We think it impossible to find that it has. In fact, quite to the contrary, our traditions have protected the marital family (Gerald, Carole, and the child they acknowledge to be theirs) against the sort of claim Michael asserts.</p>
<p id="fc0c038e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The presumption of legitimacy was a fundamental principle of the common law. H. Nicholas, Adulturine Bastardy 1 (1836). Traditionally, that presumption could be rebutted only by proof that a husband was incapable of procreation or had had no access to his wife during the relevant period. We have found nothing in the older sources, nor in the older cases, addressing specifically the power of the natural father to assert parental rights over a child born into a woman’s existing marriage with another man.</p>
<p id="fc0c038f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What Michael asserts here is a right to have himself declared the natural father and thereby to obtain parental prerogatives. What he must establish, therefore, is not that our society has traditionally allowed a natural father in his circumstances to establish paternity, but that it has traditionally accorded such a father parental rights, or at least has not traditionally denied them. Even if the law in all States had always been that the entire world could challenge the marital presumption and obtain a declaration as to who was the natural father, that would not advance Michael’s claim. Thus, it is ultimately irrelevant, even for purposes of determining current social attitudes towards the alleged substantive right Michael asserts, that the present law in a number of States appears to allow the natural father—including the natural father who has not established a relationship with the child—the theoretical power to rebut the marital presumption. What counts is whether the States in fact award substantive parental rights to the natural father of a child conceived within, and born into, an extant marital union that wishes to embrace the child. We are not aware of a single <span title="935" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-935">p. 935</span>case, old or new, that has done so. This is not the stuff of which fundamental rights qualifying as liberty interests are made.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105A5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105A5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span></p>
<p id="fc0c2aa2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not accept Justice Brennan’s criticism that this result “squashes” the liberty that consists of “the freedom not to conform.” It seems to us that reflects the erroneous view that there is only one side to this controversy—that one disposition can expand a “liberty” of sorts without contracting an equivalent “liberty” on the other side. Such a happy choice is rarely available. Here, to provide protection to an adulterous natural father is to deny protection to a marital father, and vice versa. If Michael has a “freedom not to conform” (whatever that means), Gerald must equivalently have a “freedom to conform.” One of them will pay a price for asserting that “freedom”—Michael by being unable to act as father of the child he has adulterously begotten, or Gerald by being unable to preserve the integrity of the traditional family unit he and Victoria have established. Our disposition does not choose between these two “freedoms,” but leaves that to the people of California. Justice Brennan’s approach chooses one of them as the constitutional imperative, on no apparent basis except that the unconventional is to be preferred.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aa3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have never had occasion to decide whether a child has a liberty interest, symmetrical with that of her parent, in maintaining her filial relationship. We need not do so here because, even assuming that such a right exists, Victoria’s claim must fail. Victoria’s due process challenge is, if anything, weaker than Michael’s.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aa4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]hatever the merits of the guardian ad litem’s belief that such an arrangement can be of great psychological benefit to a child, the claim that a State must recognize multiple fatherhood has no support in the history or traditions of this country. Moreover, even if we were to construe Victoria’s argument as forwarding the lesser proposition that, whatever her status vis-à-vis Gerald, she has a liberty interest in maintaining a filial relationship with her natural father, Michael, we find that, at best, her claim is the obverse of Michael’s and fails for the same reasons.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aa5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> join, dissenting.</p>

<p id="fc0c2aa7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once we recognized that the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses more than freedom from bodily restraint, today’s plurality opinion emphasizes, the concept was cut loose from one natural limitation on its meaning. This innovation paved the way, so the plurality hints, for judges to substitute their own preferences for those of elected officials. Dissatisfied with this supposedly unbridled and uncertain state of affairs, the plurality casts about for another limitation on the concept of liberty.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aa8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It finds this limitation in “tradition.” Apparently oblivious to the fact that this concept can be as malleable and as elusive as “liberty” itself, the plurality pretends that tradition places a discernible border around the Constitution. The pretense is seductive; it would be comforting to believe that a search for “tradition” involves nothing more idiosyncratic or complicated than poring through dusty volumes on American history. Even if we could agree, moreover, on the content and significance of particular traditions, we still would be forced to identify the point at which a tradition becomes firm enough to be relevant to our definition of liberty and the moment at which it becomes too obsolete to be relevant any longer. The plurality supplies no objective means by which we might make these determinations.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aa9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is ironic that an approach so utterly dependent on tradition is so indifferent to our precedents. Citing barely a handful of this Court’s numerous decisions defining the scope of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause to support its reliance on tradition, the plurality acts as though English legal treatises and the American Law Reports always have provided the sole source for our constitutional principles. They have not. Just as common-law notions no longer define the “property” that the Constitution protects, see Goldberg v. Kelly (1970), neither do they circumscribe the “liberty” that it guarantees.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aaa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s plurality, however, does not ask whether parenthood is an interest that historically has received our attention and protection; the answer to that question is too clear for dispute. Instead, the plurality asks whether the specific variety of parenthood under consideration—a natural father’s relationship with a child whose mother is married to another man—has enjoyed such protection.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we had looked to tradition with such specificity in past cases, many a decision would have reached a different result. Surely the use of contraceptives by unmarried couples, Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), or even by married couples, Griswold v. Connecticut (1965); the freedom from corporal punishment in schools, Ingraham v. Wright (1977); the freedom from an arbitrary transfer from a prison to a psychiatric institution, Vitek v. Jones (1980); and even the right to raise one’s natural but illegitimate children, Stanley v. Illinois (1972), were not “interest[s] traditionally protected by our society,” at the time of their consideration by this Court. If we had asked, therefore, in <i>Eisenstadt</i>, <i>Griswold</i>, <i>Ingraham</i>, <i>Vitek</i>, or <i>Stanley</i> itself whether the specific interest under consideration had been traditionally protected, the answer would have been a resounding “no.” That we did not ask this question in those cases highlights the novelty of the interpretive method that the plurality opinion employs today.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality’s interpretive method is more than novel; it is misguided. It ignores the good reasons for limiting the role of “tradition” in interpreting the <span title="937" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-937">p. 937</span>Constitution’s deliberately capacious language. In the plurality’s constitutional universe, we may not take notice of the fact that the original reasons for the conclusive presumption of paternity are out of place in a world in which blood tests can prove virtually beyond a shadow of a doubt who sired a particular child and in which the fact of illegitimacy no longer plays the burdensome and stigmatizing role it once did. Moreover, by describing the decisive question as whether Michael’s and Victoria’s interest is one that has been “traditionally protected by our society,” rather than one that society traditionally has thought important (with or without protecting it), and by suggesting that our sole function is to “discern the society’s views,” the plurality acts as if the only purpose of the Due Process Clause is to confirm the importance of interests already protected by a majority of the States. Transforming the protection afforded by the Due Process Clause into a redundancy mocks those who, with care and purpose, wrote the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In construing the Fourteenth Amendment to offer shelter only to those interests specifically protected by historical practice, moreover, the plurality ignores the kind of society in which our Constitution exists. We are not an assimilative, homogeneous society, but a facilitative, pluralistic one, in which we must be willing to abide someone else’s unfamiliar or even repellent practice because the same tolerant impulse protects our own idiosyncrasies. Even if we can agree, therefore, that “family” and “parenthood” are part of the good life, it is absurd to assume that we can agree on the content of those terms and destructive to pretend that we do. In a community such as ours, “liberty” must include the freedom not to conform. The plurality today squashes this freedom by requiring specific approval from history before protecting anything in the name of liberty.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The document that the plurality construes today is unfamiliar to me. It is not the living charter that I have taken to be our Constitution; it is instead a stagnant, archaic, hidebound document steeped in the prejudices and superstitions of a time long past. This Constitution does not recognize that times change, does not see that sometimes a practice or rule outlives its foundations. I cannot accept an interpretive method that does such violence to the charter that I am bound by oath to uphold.</p>
<p id="fc0c2aaf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, to describe the issue in this case as whether the relationship existing between Michael and Victoria “has been treated as a protected family unit under the historic practices of our society, or whether on any other basis it has been accorded special protection,” is to reinvent the wheel. On four prior occasions, we have considered whether unwed fathers have a constitutionally protected interest in their relationships with their children. Though different in factual and legal circumstances, these cases have produced a unifying theme: although an unwed father’s biological link to his child does not, in and of itself, guarantee him a constitutional stake in his relationship with that child, such a link combined with a substantial parent-child relationship will do so. The evidence is undisputed that Michael, Victoria, and Carole did live together as a family; that is, they shared the same household, Victoria called Michael “Daddy,” Michael contributed to Victoria’s support, and he is eager to continue his relationship with her.</p>
<p id="fc0c2ab0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The atmosphere surrounding today’s decision is one of make-believe. Beginning with the suggestion that the situation confronting us here does not repeat itself every day in every corner of the country, moving on to the claim that <span title="938" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-938">p. 938</span>it is tradition alone that supplies the details of the liberty that the Constitution protects, and passing finally to the notion that the Court always has recognized a cramped vision of “the family,” today’s decision lets stand California’s pronouncement that Michael—whom blood tests show to a 98 percent probability to be Victoria’s father—is not Victoria’s father. When and if the Court awakes to reality, it will find a world very different from the one it expects.</p>

<p id="fc0c51ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">East Cleveland’s housing ordinance, like many throughout the country, limits occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family. But the ordinance contains an unusual and complicated definitional section that recognizes as a “family” only a few categories of related individuals. Because her family, living together in her home, fits none of those categories, appellant stands convicted of a criminal offense. The question in this case is whether the ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fc0c51cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Mrs. Inez Moore, lives in her East Cleveland home together with her son, Dale Moore Sr., and her two grandsons, Dale, Jr., and John Moore, Jr. The two boys are first cousins rather than brothers; we are told that John came to live with his grandmother and with the elder and younger Dale Moores after his mother’s death. In early 1973, Mrs. Moore received a notice of violation from the city, stating that John was an “illegal occupant” and directing her to comply with the ordinance. When she failed to remove him from her home, the city filed a criminal charge. Mrs. Moore moved to dismiss, claiming that the ordinance was constitutionally invalid on its face. Her motion was overruled, and upon conviction she was sentenced to five days in jail and a $25 fine.</p>

<p id="fc0c51ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city argues that our decision in Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas (1974), requires us to sustain the ordinance attacked here. Belle Terre, like East Cleveland, imposed limits on the types of groups that could occupy a single <span title="939" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-939">p. 939</span>dwelling unit. [W]e sustained the Belle Terre ordinance on the ground that it bore a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.</p>
<p id="fc0c51cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But one overriding factor sets this case apart from Belle Terre. The ordinance there affected only unrelated individuals. It expressly allowed all who were related by “blood, adoption, or marriage” to live together, and in sustaining the ordinance we were careful to note that it promoted “family needs” and “family values.” East Cleveland, in contrast, has chosen to regulate the occupancy of its housing by slicing deeply into the family itself. This is no mere incidental result of the ordinance. On its face it selects certain categories of relatives who may live together and declares that others may not. In particular, it makes a crime of a grandmother’s choice to live with her grandson in circumstances like those presented here.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a city undertakes such intrusive regulation of the family, neither Belle Terre nor Euclid governs; the usual judicial deference to the legislature is inappropriate. “This Court has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Of course, the family is not beyond regulation. But when the government intrudes on choices concerning family living arrangements, this Court must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When thus examined, this ordinance cannot survive. The city seeks to justify it as a means of preventing overcrowding, minimizing traffic and parking congestion, and avoiding an undue financial burden on East Cleveland’s school system. Although these are legitimate goals, the ordinance before us serves them marginally, at best. For example, the ordinance permits any family consisting only of husband, wife, and unmarried children to live together, even if the family contains a half dozen licensed drivers, each with his or her own car. At the same time it forbids an adult brother and sister to share a household, even if both faithfully use public transportation. The ordinance would permit a grandmother to live with a single dependent son and children, even if his school-age children number a dozen, yet it forces Mrs. Moore to find another dwelling for her grandson John, simply because of the presence of his uncle and cousin in the same household. We need not labor the point. Section 1341.08 has but a tenuous relation to alleviation of the conditions mentioned by the city.</p>

<p id="fc0c51d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city suggests that any constitutional right to live together as a family extends only to the nuclear family, essentially a couple and their dependent children. But unless we close our eyes to the basic reasons why certain rights associated with the family have been accorded shelter under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, we cannot avoid applying the force and rationale of these precedents to the family choice involved in this case.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding those reasons requires careful attention to this Court’s function under the Due Process Clause. Substantive due process has at times been a treacherous field for this Court. There are risks when the judicial branch gives enhanced protection to certain substantive liberties without the guidance of the more specific provisions of the Bill of Rights. As the history of the Lochner <span title="940" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-940">p. 940</span>era demonstrates, there is reason for concern lest the only limits to such judicial intervention become the predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court. That history counsels caution and restraint. But it does not counsel abandonment, nor does it require what the city urges here: cutting off any protection of family rights at the first convenient, if arbitrary boundary—the boundary of the nuclear family.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appropriate limits on substantive due process come not from drawing arbitrary lines but rather from careful “respect for the teachings of history [and], solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society.” Our decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition. It is through the family that we inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values, moral and cultural.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ours is by no means a tradition limited to respect for the bonds uniting the members of the nuclear family. The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially grandparents sharing a household along with parents and children has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition. Over the years millions of our citizens have grown up in just such an environment, and most, surely, have profited from it. Even if conditions of modern society have brought about a decline in extended family households, they have not erased the accumulated wisdom of civilization, gained over the centuries and honored throughout our history, that supports a larger conception of the family. Out of choice, necessity, or a sense of family responsibility, it has been common for close relatives to draw together and participate in the duties and the satisfactions of a common home. Especially in times of adversity, such as the death of a spouse or economic need, the broader family has tended to come together for mutual sustenance and to maintain or rebuild a secure home life. This is apparently what happened here.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not such a household is established because of personal tragedy, the choice of relatives in this degree of kinship to live together may not lightly be denied by the State. By the same token the Constitution prevents East Cleveland from standardizing its children and its adults by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc0c51d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, the Court considered a New York village ordinance that restricted land use within the village to single-family dwellings. That ordinance defined “family” to include all persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage who lived and cooked together as a single-housekeeping unit; it forbade occupancy by any group of three or more persons who were not so related. We held that the ordinance was a valid effort by the village government to promote the general community welfare, and that it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or infringe any other rights or freedoms protected by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc0c51da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, the ordinance involved in Belle Terre did not prevent blood relatives from occupying the same dwelling, and the Court’s decision in that case does not, therefore, foreclose the appellant’s arguments based specifically on the ties of kinship present in this case. Nonetheless, I would hold that the existence of those ties does not elevate either the appellant’s claim of associational freedom or her claim of privacy to a level invoking constitutional protection.</p>
<p id="fc0c51db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="941" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-941">p. 941</span>Although the appellant’s desire to share a single-dwelling unit also involves “private family life” in a sense, that desire can hardly be equated with any of the interests protected in the cases just cited. The ordinance about which the appellant complains did not impede her choice to have or not to have children, and it did not dictate to her how her own children were to be nurtured and reared. The ordinance clearly does not prevent parents from living together or living with their unemancipated offspring.</p>
<p id="fc0c51dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obviously, East Cleveland might have as easily and perhaps as effectively hit upon a different definition of “family.” The point is that any definition would produce hardships in some cases without materially advancing the legislative purpose. That this ordinance also does so is no reason to hold it unconstitutional, unless we are to use our power to interpret the United States Constitution as a sort of generalized authority to correct seeming inequity wherever it surfaces. It is not for us to rewrite the ordinance, or substitute our judgment for the discretion of the prosecutor who elected to initiate this litigation.</p>

<p id="fc0c51dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has emphasized that individuals must be related to one another to be considered a family. For example, in <i>Moore</i>, the Court distinguished the earlier decision in Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), where the Court had upheld a similar zoning ordinance that limited the number of unrelated people who could live together in one household. In <i>Belle Terre</i>, a group of college students who wanted to share a house brought a constitutional challenge to the ordinance. The Court in <i>Moore</i> emphasized that <i>Belle Terre</i> had involved only “<i>unrelated</i> individuals” and, in fact, the zoning ordinance there had an exception for “all who were related by ‘blood, adoption, or marriage.’”</p>
<p id="fc0c78ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court invoked the same distinction between relatives and non-relatives in Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, 431 U.S. 816 (1977), which concerned the rights of foster parents. The Supreme Court held that the state did not violate due process in providing preremoval hearings only to foster parents who had been with a child for 18 months or more. The Court observed that although its prior decisions had involved a biological relationship, “[n]o one would seriously dispute that a deeply loving and interdependent relationship between an adult and a child in his or her care may exist even in the absence of a blood relationship.”</p>
<p id="fc0c78ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Court also saw key differences between biological parents and foster parents. The Court said that “whatever emotional ties may develop between foster parent and foster child have their origins in an arrangement in which the State has been a partner from the outset.” Also, the Court stressed that protecting a liberty interest for foster parents often would be at the expense of the liberty of natural parents.</p>
<p id="fc0c78f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concluded that it did not need to resolve the nature of the liberty interest of foster parents because the state law provided adequate protections even assuming rights of foster parents. The Court said that due process did not require that there be a hearing every time a child was removed from a foster home and that it was sufficient for the government to provide pre-removal due process for those foster parents who had been with a child for more than 18 months.</p>

<p id="fc0c78f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first Supreme Court cases recognizing family autonomy involved the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children. It is notable that they were decided during the <i>Lochner</i> era and expressly use substantive due process to protect this right. Although economic substantive due process was abandoned in 1937, as discussed in Chapter 6, the Supreme Court’s decisions of that era protecting parental decision making are very much still followed.</p>

The information is based upon “An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska,” approved April 9, 1919, which follows:</p>

</div>

<p id="fc0c78fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment of conviction. While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect. Determination by the Legislature of what constitutes proper exercise of police power is not final or conclusive but is subject to supervision by the courts.</p>

Although such measures have been deliberately approved by men of great genius, their ideas touching the relation between individual and state were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any Legislature could impose such restrictions upon the people of a state without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc0ca014-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The desire of the Legislature to foster a homogeneous people with American ideals prepared readily to understand current discussions of civic matters is easy to appreciate. Unfortunate experiences during the late war and aversion toward every character of truculent adversaries were certainly enough to quicken that aspiration. But the means adopted, we think, exceed the limitations upon the power of the state and conflict with rights assured to plaintiff in error. The interference is plain enough and no adequate reason therefore in time of peace and domestic tranquility has been shown. It is well known that proficiency in a foreign language seldom comes to one not instructed at an early age, and experience shows that this is not injurious to the health, morals or understanding of the ordinary child.</p>

The challenged act, effective September 1, 1926, requires every parent, guardian, or other person having control or charge or custody of a child between 8 and 16 years to send him “to a public school for the period of time a public school shall be held during the current year” in the district where the child resides; and failure so to do is declared a misdemeanor.</p>
<p id="fc0ca018-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inevitable practical result of enforcing the act under consideration would be destruction of appellees’ primary schools, and perhaps all other private primary schools for normal children within the state of Oregon.

<p id="fc0ca019-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the doctrine of Meyer v. Nebraska, we think it entirely plain that the Act of 1922 unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. As often heretofore pointed out, rights guaranteed by the Constitution may not be abridged by legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state. The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.</p>

<p id="fc0ca01b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court also has recognized that the right to make parenting decisions is not absolute and can be interfered with by the state if necessary to protect a child. For example, in Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Court upheld the application of child labor laws to a nine-year-old girl who was soliciting for the Jehovah’s Witnesses religion at the direction of her parents. The Court acknowledged that there is a “private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” But the Court said that “the family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest. . . . Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent’s control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor and in many other ways.” The Court said that the need to protect children from being exploited and harmed justified upholding laws prohibiting child labor, even if the work was at the direction of the parents and even if it was undertaken for religious purposes.</p>

The Court said that “a State’s interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children.”</p>
<p id="fc0ca01e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court gave great weight to the parents’ claim that additional education would threaten their children’s religious beliefs and to the uniquely insulated nature of the Amish culture. The Court accepted the argument that applying <span title="945" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-945">p. 945</span>the mandatory schooling law to 14- and 15-year-old Amish children would interfere with free exercise of religion and with the ability of parents to make decisions concerning their children. The Court noted that there was no evidence of “any harm to the physical or mental health of the child or to the public safety, peace, order, or welfare.” The Court thus concluded that “[u]nder the doctrine of Meyer v. Nebraska we think it entirely plain that the Act . . . interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.”</p>
<p id="fc0ca01f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s substantial deference to parents also is reflected in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979). <i>Parham</i> presented the question of what type of procedural due process must be accorded to children when their parents commit them to an institution. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that except in an emergency, before an adult can be committed to an institution there must be notice and a hearing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10771_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10771_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span> But the Court said that the assumption must be that a parent is acting in the best interests of a child when making a commitment decision.</p>
<p id="fc0ca021-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court recognized that some parents might abuse the power to institutionalize a child but said that this was not a sufficient basis for treating commitment of children like commitment of adults. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, stated, “That some parents may at times be acting against the interests of their children . . . creates a basis for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child’s best interests. The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in <i>all</i> cases because <i>some</i> parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.”</p>
<p id="fc0ca022-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the Court concluded that before a parent can institutionalize a child, there only need be a screening by a doctor or other neutral fact finder. A child, unlike an adult, did not have to be given notice and an evidentiary hearing. The dissenting opinion by Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall and Stevens, emphasized the “massive curtailment of liberty” inherent to institutionalization and the need to protect children from the possibility of erroneous commitment. The dissent said that “[c]hildren incarcerated in public mental institutions are constitutionally entitled to a fair opportunity to contest the legitimacy of their confinement. They are entitled to some champion who can speak on their behalf and who stands ready to oppose a wrongful commitment. . . . And fairness demands that children abandoned by their supposed protectors to the rigors of institutional confinement be given the help of some separate voice.”</p>
<p id="fc0cc733-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s most recent decision in this area, albeit almost 20 years ago, strongly reaffirmed the constitutional right of parents to control the upbringing of their children.</p>

Respondent Tommie Granville, the mother of Isabella and Natalie, opposed the petition. The case ultimately reached the Washington Supreme Court, which held that §26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally interferes with the fundamental right of parents to rear their children.</p>

<p id="fc0cc73c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel shared a relationship that ended in June 1991. The two never married, but they had two daughters, Isabelle and Natalie. Jenifer and Gary Troxel are Brad’s parents, and thus the paternal grandparents of Isabelle and Natalie. After Tommie and Brad separated in 1991, Brad lived with his parents and regularly brought his daughters to his parents’ home for weekend visitation. Brad committed suicide in May 1993. Although the Troxels at first continued to see Isabelle and Natalie on a regular basis after their son’s death, Tommie Granville informed the Troxels in October 1993 that she wished to limit their visitation with her daughters to one short visit per month. In December 1993, the Troxels commenced the present action by filing, in the Washington Superior Court for Skagit County, a petition to obtain visitation rights with Isabelle and Natalie.</p>

<p id="fc0cc73e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The demographic changes of the past century make it difficult to speak of an average American family. The composition of families varies greatly from household to household. While many children may have two married parents and grandparents who visit regularly, many other children are raised in single-parent households. In 1996, children living with only one parent accounted for 28 percent of all children under age 18 in the United States. Understandably, in these single-parent households, persons outside the nuclear family are called upon with increasing frequency to assist in the everyday tasks of child rearing. In many cases, grandparents play an important role. For example, in 1998, approximately 4 million children—or 5.6 percent of all children under age 18—lived in the household of their grandparents.</p>
<p id="fc0cee4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nationwide enactment of nonparental visitation statutes is assuredly due, in some part, to the States’ recognition of these changing realities of the American family. Because grandparents and other relatives undertake duties of a parental nature in many households, States have sought to ensure the welfare of the children therein by protecting the relationships those children form with such third parties. The States’ nonparental visitation statutes are further supported by a recognition, which varies from State to State, that children should have the opportunity to benefit from relationships with statutorily specified persons—for example, their grandparents. The extension of statutory rights in this area to persons other than a child’s parents, however, comes with an obvious <span title="947" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-947">p. 947</span>cost. For example, the State’s recognition of an independent third-party interest in a child can place a substantial burden on the traditional parent-child relationship.</p>
<p id="fc0cee50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court. Section 26.10.160(3), as applied to Granville and her family in this case, unconstitutionally infringes on that fundamental parental right. The Washington nonparental visitation statute is breathtakingly broad. According to the statute’s text, “[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time,” and the court may grant such visitation rights whenever “visitation may serve the best interest of the child.”</p>
<p id="fc0cee51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That language effectively permits any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent’s children to state-court review. Once the visitation petition has been filed in court and the matter is placed before a judge, a parent’s decision that visitation would not be in the child’s best interest is accorded no deference. Section 26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a court accord the parent’s decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge. Should the judge disagree with the parent’s estimation of the child’s best interests, the judge’s view necessarily prevails. Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge’s determination of the child’s best interests. The Washington Supreme Court had the opportunity to give §26.10.160(3) a narrower reading, but it declined to do so.</p>
<p id="fc0cee52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the facts of this case, the record reveals that the Superior Court’s order was based on precisely the type of mere disagreement we have just described and nothing more. The Superior Court’s order was not founded on any special factors that might justify the State’s interference with Granville’s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the rearing of her two daughters. To be sure, this case involves a visitation petition filed by grandparents soon after the death of their son—the father of Isabelle and Natalie—but the combination of several factors here compels our conclusion that §26.10.160(3), as applied, exceeded the bounds of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc0cee53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the Troxels did not allege, and no court has found, that Granville was an unfit parent. That aspect of the case is important, for there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. [S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent’s children.</p>
<p id="fc0cee54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem here is not that the Washington Superior Court intervened, but that when it did so, it gave no special weight at all to Granville’s determination of her daughters’ best interests. More importantly, it appears that the Superior Court applied exactly the opposite presumption. In an ideal world, parents might always seek to cultivate the bonds between grandparents and their grandchildren. Needless to say, however, our world is far from perfect, and in it the decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance. <span title="948" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-948">p. 948</span>And, if a fit parent’s decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent’s own determination.</p>
<p id="fc0cee55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we note that there is no allegation that Granville ever sought to cut off visitation entirely. Rather, the present dispute originated when Granville informed the Troxels that she would prefer to restrict their visitation with Isabelle and Natalie to one short visit per month and special holidays[, w]hile the Troxels requested two weekends per month and two full weeks in the summer.</p>
<p id="fc0cee56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considered together with the Superior Court’s reasons for awarding visitation to the Troxels, the combination of these factors demonstrates that the visitation order in this case was an unconstitutional infringement on Granville’s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her two daughters. The Washington Superior Court failed to accord the determination of Granville, a fit custodial parent, any material weight.</p>
<p id="fc0cee57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold that §26.10.160(3), as applied in this case, is unconstitutional. Because we rest our decision on the sweeping breadth of §26.10.160(3) and the application of that broad, unlimited power in this case, we do not consider the primary constitutional question passed on by the Washington Supreme Court—whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to granting visitation. We do not, and need not, define today the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context. In this respect, the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best “elaborated with care.”</p>
<p id="fc0cee58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc0cee59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I concur in the judgment affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington, whose facial invalidation of its own state statute is consistent with this Court’s prior cases addressing the substantive interests at stake. I would say no more. The issues that might well be presented by reviewing a decision addressing the specific application of the state statute by the trial court, are not before us and do not call for turning any fresh furrows in the “treacherous field” of substantive due process.</p>
<p id="fc0cee5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Washington invalidated its state statute based on the text of the statute alone, not its application to any particular case. Its ruling rested on two independently sufficient grounds: the failure of the statute to require harm to the child to justify a disputed visitation order, and the statute’s authorization of “any person” at “any time” to petition and to receive visitation rights subject only to a free-ranging best-interests-of-the-child standard. I see no error in the second reason, that because the state statute authorizes any person at any time to request (and a judge to award) visitation rights, subject only to the State’s particular best-interests standard, the state statute sweeps too broadly and is unconstitutional on its face. Consequently, there is no need to decide whether harm is required or to consider the precise scope of the parent’s right or its necessary protections.</p>
<p id="fc0cee5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc0cee5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write separately to note that neither party has argued that our substantive due process cases were wrongly decided and that the original understanding of <span title="949" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-949">p. 949</span>the Due Process Clause precludes judicial enforcement of unenumerated rights under that constitutional provision. As a result, I express no view on the merits of this matter, and I understand the plurality as well to leave the resolution of that issue for another day.</p>
<p id="fc0d156d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consequently, I agree with the plurality that this Court’s recognition of a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children resolves this case. Our decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) holds that parents have a fundamental constitutional right to rear their children, including the right to determine who shall educate and socialize them. The opinions of the plurality, Justice Kennedy<span class="epub-small-caps">,</span> and Justice Souter recognize such a right, but curiously none of them articulates the appropriate standard of review. I would apply strict scrutiny to infringements of fundamental rights. Here, the State of Washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest—to say nothing of a compelling one—in second-guessing a fit parent’s decision regarding visitation with third parties. On this basis, I would affirm the judgment below.</p>

<p id="fc0d156f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today wisely declines to endorse either the holding or the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Washington. In my opinion, the Court would have been even wiser to deny certiorari. Given the problematic character of the trial court’s decision and the uniqueness of the Washington statute, there was no pressing need to review a State Supreme Court decision that merely requires the state legislature to draft a better statute.</p>
<p id="fc0d1570-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having decided to address the merits, however, the Court should begin by recognizing that the State Supreme Court rendered a federal constitutional judgment holding a state law invalid on its face. In light of that judgment, I believe that we should confront the federal questions presented directly. For the Washington statute is not made facially invalid either because it may be invoked by too many hypothetical plaintiffs, or because it leaves open the possibility that someone may be permitted to sustain a relationship with a child without having to prove that serious harm to the child would otherwise result.</p>
<p id="fc0d1571-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc0d1572-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, a right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is among the “unalienable Rights” with which the Declaration of Independence proclaims “all Men . . . are endowed by their Creator.” And in my view that right is also among the “othe[r][rights] retained by the people” which the Ninth Amendment says the Constitution’s enumeration of rights “shall not be construed to deny or disparage.” The Declaration of Independence, however, is not a legal prescription conferring powers upon the courts; and the Constitution’s refusal to “deny or disparage” other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges’ list against laws duly enacted by the people. Consequently, while I would think it entirely compatible with the commitment to representative democracy set forth in the founding documents to argue, in legislative chambers or in electoral campaigns, that the state has no power to interfere with parents’ authority over the rearing of their children, I do not believe that the power which the Constitution confers upon me as a judge entitles me to deny legal effect to laws that (in my view) infringe upon what is (in my view) that unenumerated right.</p>
<p id="fc0d1573-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="950" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-950">p. 950</span>If we embrace this unenumerated right, I think it obvious—whether we affirm or reverse the judgment here, that we will be ushering in a new regime of judicially prescribed, and federally prescribed, family law. I have no reason to believe that federal judges will be better at this than state legislatures; and state legislatures have the great advantages of doing harm in a more circumscribed area, of being able to correct their mistakes in a flash, and of being removable by the people.</p>

It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.</p>

<p id="fc0d63ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case touches a sensitive and important area of human rights. Oklahoma deprives certain individuals of a right which is basic to the perpetuation of a race—the right to have offspring. The statute involved is Oklahoma’s Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act. That Act defines an “habitual criminal” as a person who, having been convicted two or more times for crimes “amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude” either in an Oklahoma court or in a court of any other State, is thereafter convicted of such a felony in Oklahoma and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in an Oklahoma penal institution.</p>

He was confined there in 1935 when the Act was passed. In 1936 the Attorney General instituted proceedings against him. Petitioner in his answer challenged the Act as unconstitutional by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. A jury trial was had. The court instructed the jury that the crimes of which petitioner had been convicted were felonies involving moral turpitude and that the only question for the jury was whether the operation of vasectomy could be performed on petitioner without detriment to his general health. The jury found that it could be. A judgment directing that the operation of vasectomy be performed on petitioner was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma by a five to four decision.</p>
<p id="fc0d63ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, farreaching and devastating effects. In evil or reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear. There is no redemption for the individual whom the law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his irreparable injury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty. We mention these matters not to reexamine the scope of the police power of the States. We advert to them merely in emphasis of our view that strict scrutiny of the classification which a State makes in a sterilization law is essential, lest unwittingly or otherwise invidious discriminations are made against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and equal laws.</p>
<p id="fc0d63ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sterilization of those who have thrice committed grand larceny with immunity for those who are embezzlers is a clear, pointed, unmistakable discrimination. Oklahoma makes no attempt to say that he who commits larceny by trespass or trick or fraud has biologically inheritable traits which he who commits embezzlement lacks. We have not the slightest basis for inferring that that line has any significance in eugenics nor that the inheritability of criminal traits follows the neat legal distinctions which the law has marked between those two offenses. In terms of fines and imprisonment the crimes of larceny and embezzlement rate the same under the Oklahoma code. Only when it comes to sterilization are the pains and penalties of the law different. The equal protection clause would indeed be a formula of empty words if such conspicuously artificial lines could be drawn.</p>

If Oklahoma may resort generally to the sterilization of criminals on the assumption that their propensities are transmissible to future generations by inheritance, I seriously doubt that the equal protection clause requires it to apply the measure to all criminals in the first instance, or to none. And so I think the real question we have to consider is not one of equal protection, but whether the wholesale condemnation of a class to such an invasion of personal liberty, without opportunity to any individual to show that his is not the type of case which would justify resort to it, satisfies the demands of due process.</p>

Overtones of some arguments suggest that Lochner v. State of New York should be our guide. But we decline that invitation as we did in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish; Olsen v. State of Nebraska; Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Co.; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. This law, however, operates directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation.</p>
<p id="fc0d8ace-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights. The right to educate a child in a school of the parents’ choice—whether public or private or parochial—is also not mentioned. Nor is the right to study any particular subject or any foreign language. Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain of those rights.</p>
<p id="fc0d8acf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the right to educate one’s children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. By Meyer v. State of Nebraska, the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school. In other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.</p>
<p id="fc0d8ad0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another <span title="954" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-954">p. 954</span>facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” We have had many controversies over these penumbral rights of “privacy and repose.”</p>
<p id="fc0d8ad1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that a “governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.” Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</p>
<p id="fc0d8ad2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.</p>

<p id="fc0d8ad4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that Connecticut’s birth-control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of marital privacy, and I join in its opinion and judgment. My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted and that it embraces the right of marital privacy though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution is supported both by numerous decisions of this Court, referred to in the Court’s opinion, and by the language and history of the Ninth Amendment. I add these words to emphasize the relevance of that Amendment to the Court’s holding.</p>
<p id="fc0d8ad5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Amendment reads, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” The Amendment is almost entirely the work of James Madison. It was introduced in Congress by him and passed the House and Senate with little or no debate and virtually no change in language. It was proffered to quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights could not be sufficiently broad to cover all essential rights and that the specific mention of certain rights would be interpreted as a denial that others were protected.</p>
<p id="fc0db1e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment, “[i]t cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.” Marbury v. Madison. In interpreting the Constitution, “real effect should be given to all the words it uses.” Myers v. United States. The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution may be regarded by some as a recent <span title="955" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-955">p. 955</span>discovery and may be forgotten by others, but since 1791 it has been a basic part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold. To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever. Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment, which specifically states that “[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”</p>
<p id="fc0db1e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the “liberty” protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.</p>
<p id="fc0db1e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining which rights are fundamental, judges are not left at large to decide cases in light of their personal and private notions. Rather, they must look to the “traditions and [collective] conscience of our people” to determine whether a principle is “so rooted [there] . . . as to be ranked as fundamental.” The inquiry is whether a right involved “is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those ‘fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.’ . . .”</p>
<p id="fc0db1e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree fully with the Court that, applying these tests, the right of privacy is a fundamental personal right, emanating “from the totality of the constitutional scheme under which we live.” While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy, in my view it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size, which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts. Yet, if upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality, a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid, then, by the same reasoning, a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid. In my view, however, both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected.</p>
<p id="fc0db1ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State, at most, argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concern—the discouraging of extra-marital relations. It says that preventing the use of birth-control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extra-marital relations. The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut, unmarried as well as married, of birth-control devices for the prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception. But, in any event, it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute, which does not, like the present one, sweep unnecessarily broadly, reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples. The State of Connecticut does have statutes, the constitutionality of which is beyond doubt, which prohibit adultery and fornication. These statutes demonstrate that means for achieving the same basic purpose of protecting marital fidelity are available to Connecticut without the need to “invade the area of protected freedoms.”</p>
<p id="fc0db1eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="956" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-956">p. 956</span>Finally, it should be said of the Court’s holding today that it in no way interferes with a State’s proper regulation of sexual promiscuity or misconduct. As my Brother Harlan so well stated in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, “Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids . . . but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected. It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extra-marital sexuality . . . or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy.”</p>
<p id="fc0db1ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic—a personal right “retained by the people” within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment. Connecticut cannot constitutionally abridge this fundamental right, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States. I agree with the Court that petitioners’ convictions must therefore be reversed.</p>
<p id="fc0db1ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Harlan,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc0db1ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” Palko v. State of Connecticut. While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands, in my opinion, on its own bottom.</p>
<p id="fc0db1ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judicial self-restraint will be achieved in this area, as in other constitutional areas, only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms. Adherence to these principles will not, of course, obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges, nor should it. Their continued recognition will, however, go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc0db1f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc0db1f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view this Connecticut law as applied to married couples deprives them of “liberty” without due process of law, as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself, or that the anti-use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion. Rather, the statute is said to serve the State’s policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships, be they premarital or extramarital, concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal.</p>
<p id="fc0db1f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct, I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State’s ban <span title="957" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-957">p. 957</span>on illicit sexual relationships. Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices; they are not considered contraband material under state law, and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed. The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute whose operation in this context has been quite obviously ineffective and whose most serious use has been against birth-control clinics rendering advice to married, rather than unmarried, persons. Moreover, it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law.</p>
<p id="fc0dd903-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these circumstances one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations and thereby contributes to the State’s policy against such relationships. Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation. It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration.</p>

In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do, I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is my Brethren of the majority.</p>
<p id="fc0dd907-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court talks about a constitutional “right of privacy” as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the “privacy” of individuals. But there is not. There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities. Such, for example, is the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against “unreasonable searches and seizures.” But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but “privacy.” To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given.</p>
<p id="fc0dd908-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional “right of privacy” as an emanation from one or more constitutional provisions. I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision. For these reasons I cannot agree with the Court’s judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fc0dd909-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers Harlan, White and Goldberg for invalidating the Connecticut law. I think that if properly construed neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment, nor both together, could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law. I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because on analysis they turn out to be the same thing—merely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to <span title="958" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-958">p. 958</span>invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational, unreasonable or offensive.</p>
<p id="fc0dd90a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My Brother Goldberg has adopted the recent discovery that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks violates “fundamental principles of liberty and justice,” or is contrary to the “traditions and [collective] conscience of our people.” He also states, without proof satisfactory to me, that in making decisions on this basis judges will not consider “their personal and private notions.” One may ask how they can avoid considering them. Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll. And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the “[collective] conscience of our people.” Moreover, one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment to find that the framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress. Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine. Use of any such broad, unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court’s members a day-to-day constitutional convention.</p>
<p id="fc0dd90b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must with all deference reject that philosophy.</p>
<p id="fc0dd90c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution makers knew the need for change and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people’s elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and being somewhat old-fashioned I must add it is good enough for me. And so, I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law.</p>

I think this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, ethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do.</p>

<p id="fc0e0027-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc0e0028-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee William Baird was convicted at a bench trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court under Massachusetts General Laws Ann., first, for exhibiting contraceptive articles in the course of delivering a lecture on contraception to a group of students at Boston University and, second, for giving a young woman a package of Emko vaginal foam at the close of his address.</p>
<p id="fc0e0029-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Massachusetts General Laws Ann. under which Baird was convicted, provides a maximum five-year term of imprisonment for “whoever . . . gives away . . . any drug, medicine, instrument or article whatever for the prevention of conception,” except as authorized in §21A. Under §21A, “[a] registered physician may administer to or prescribe for any married person drugs or articles intended for the prevention of pregnancy or conception. [And a] registered pharmacist actually engaged in the business of pharmacy may furnish such drugs or articles to any married person presenting a prescription from a registered physician.” As interpreted by the State Supreme Judicial Court, these provisions make it a felony for anyone, other than a registered physician or pharmacist acting in accordance with the terms of §21A, to dispense any article with the intention that it be used for the prevention of conception. The statutory scheme distinguishes among three distinct classes of distributees—first, married persons may obtain contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, but only from doctors or druggists on prescription; second, single persons may not obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent pregnancy; and, third, married or single persons may obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent, not pregnancy, but the spread of disease.</p>
<p id="fc0e002a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question for our determination in this case is whether there is some ground of difference that rationally explains the different treatment accorded married and unmarried persons under Massachusetts laws. Section 21 stems from an 1879 statute, which prohibited without exception, distribution of articles intended to be used as contraceptives. In Commonwealth v. Allison (1917), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court explained that the law’s “plain purpose is to protect purity, to preserve chastity, to encourage continence and self restraint, to defend the sanctity of the home, and thus to engender in the State and nation a virile and virtuous race of men and women.”</p>
<p id="fc0e002b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e cannot agree that the deterrence of premarital sex may reasonably be regarded as the purpose of the Massachusetts law. It would be plainly unreasonable to assume that Massachusetts has prescribed pregnancy and the birth of an <span title="960" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-960">p. 960</span>unwanted child as punishment for fornication, which is a misdemeanor under Massachusetts General Laws Ann. Aside from the scheme of values that assumption would attribute to the State, it is abundantly clear that the effect of the ban on distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons has at best a marginal relation to the proffered objective.</p>
<p id="fc0e002c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Massachusetts statute cannot be upheld as a deterrent to fornication or as a health measure, may it, nevertheless, be sustained simply as a prohibition on contraception? Whatever the rights of the individual to access contraceptives may be, the rights must be the same for the unmarried and the married alike.</p>
<p id="fc0e002d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If under <i>Griswold</i> the distribution of contraceptives to married persons cannot be prohibited, a ban on distribution to unmarried persons would be equally impermissible. It is true that in <i>Griswold</i> the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.</p>
<p id="fc0e002e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]f <i>Griswold</i> is no bar to a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives, the State could not, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, outlaw distribution to unmarried but not to married persons. In each case the evil, as perceived by the State, would be identical, and the underinclusion would be invidious.</p>

<p id="fc0e0030-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in sustaining appellee’s conviction for dispensing medicinal material without a license seems eminently correct to me and I would not disturb it. I see nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment or any other part of the Constitution that even vaguely suggests that these medicinal forms of contraceptives must be available in the open market. I do not challenge Griswold v. Connecticut despite its tenuous moorings to the text of the Constitution, but I cannot view it as controlling authority for this case. The Court was there confronted with a statute flatly prohibiting the use of contraceptives, not one regulating their distribution. I simply cannot believe that the limitation on the class of lawful distributors has significantly impaired the right to use contraceptives in Massachusetts. By relying on <i>Griswold</i> in the present context, the Court has passed beyond the penumbras of the specific guarantees into the uncircumscribed area of personal predilections.</p>
</div></div>

<p id="fc0e2641-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also protected the right to purchase and use contraceptives in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977). In <i>Carey</i>, the Court declared unconstitutional a New York law that made it a crime to sell or distribute contraceptives to minors under age 16, for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute contraceptives to persons over age 15, and for anyone to advertise or display contraceptives. The Court reviewed the cases concerning family and procreational autonomy and said that “[t]he decision whether or not to beget or bear a child is at the very heart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices.” The Court thus said that strict scrutiny must be met for the government to justify a law restricting access to contraceptives. <span title="961" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-961">p. 961</span>Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, said, “‘Compelling’ is of course the key word; where a decision as fundamental as that whether to bear or beget a child is involved, regulations imposing a burden on it may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.”</p>
<p id="fc0e2642-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the Court found that limiting distribution of contraceptives to licensed pharmacists unduly restricted access to birth control and infringed the right to control procreation. Additionally, the Court found that the law violated the rights of those under age 16 to have access to contraceptives. The Court explained, “Since the State may not impose a blanket prohibition, or even a blanket requirement of parental consent, on the choice of a minor to terminate her pregnancy, the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition of the distribution of contraceptives to a minor is a fortiori foreclosed.” The Court doubted that prohibiting distribution of contraceptives would deter teenage sexual activity and, in any event, thought it irrational that the state would want an unwanted pregnancy to be the punishment for fornication.</p>

<p id="fc0e2645-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Few decisions in Supreme Court history have provoked the intense controversy that has surrounded the abortion rulings. The debate, in part, is over constitutional methodology. Should the Court protect such a right that is not mentioned in the text and was not clearly intended by the framers? This, of course, is the same methodological question that can be asked about all of the unenumerated rights concerning family and reproductive autonomy protected by the Court. Also, the heated battle over abortion reflects the strong sentiments on both sides. There simply is no middle ground between those who believe that abortion is murder and those who reject that view and believe that a woman should not be forced by the state to be an incubator.</p>
<p id="fc0e2646-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In examining the right to abortion, analysis is divided into five parts. The first subsection reviews the Supreme Court’s conclusion that the Constitution protects the right of women to choose to terminate their pregnancies prior to viability. Roe v.

The third subsection presents the decisions concerning laws that prohibit the use of government funds or facilities for performing abortions. The fourth subsection examines a particular type of government regulation that has been declared unconstitutional: spousal consent and spousal notification requirements for married women’s abortions. Finally, the last subsection reviews the law concerning the ability of a state to require parental notice and/or consent for an unmarried minor’s abortion.</p>

One’s philosophy, one’s experiences, one’s exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one’s religious training, one’s attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one’s thinking and conclusions about abortion.</p>

<p id="fc0e4d63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman’s life, are not of ancient or even of common-law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Ancient attitudes. These are not capable of precise determination. We are told that at the time of the Persian Empire abortifacients were known and that criminal abortions were severely punished. We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era, and that “it was resorted to without scruple.” The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome’s prevailing free-abortion practices. He found it necessary to think first of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable. Greek and Roman law afforded little protection to the unborn. If abortion was prosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept of a violation of the father’s right to his offspring. Ancient religion did not bar abortion.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The Hippocratic Oath. What then of the famous Oath that has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that bears the name of the great Greek (460(?)-377(?) <span class="epub-small-caps">b.c.</span>), who has been described as the Father of Medicine, the “wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art,” and the “most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity,” who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical knowledge of the past? The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation the content is clear: “I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion.” Why did not the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and that of Rome? The late <span title="963" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-963">p. 963</span>Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory: The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates’ day; only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide. Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at least prior to viability. Dr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. The common law. It is undisputed that at common law, abortion performed before “quickening”—the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy—was not an indictable offense. The absence of a common-law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. Whether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. The American law. In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the pre-existing English common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough’s Act that related to a woman “quick with child.” The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860. It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening but were lenient with it before quickening.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the 1950’s a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. In the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code. By the end of 1970, four other States had repealed criminal penalties for abortions performed in early pregnancy by a licensed physician, subject to stated procedural and health requirements.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is thus apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.</p>

<p id="fc0e4d6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence. It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, <span title="964" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-964">p. 964</span>does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously.</p>
<p id="fc0e4d6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. This was particularly true prior to the development of antisepsis. Appellants and various amici refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth. Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain. The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal “abortion mills” strengthens, rather than weakens, the State’s interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman’s own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.</p>
<p id="fc0e747d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third reason is the State’s interest—some phrase it in terms of duty—in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. The State’s interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth. In assessing the State’s interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.</p>
<p id="fc0e747e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is with these interests, and the weight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.</p>

<p id="fc0e7480-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not <span title="965" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-965">p. 965</span>to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.</p>
<p id="fc0e7481-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman’s right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant’s arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman’s sole determination, are unpersuasive. The Court’s decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute.</p>
<p id="fc0e7482-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.</p>
<p id="fc0e7483-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where certain “fundamental rights” are involved, the Court has held that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a “compelling state interest,” and that legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake.</p>
<p id="fc0e7484-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a “person” within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant’s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The Constitution does not define “person” in so many words. [T]his, together with our observation, that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word “person,” as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.</p>
<p id="fc0e7485-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus. The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which <i>Eisenstadt</i> and <i>Griswold</i>, <i>Stanley</i>, <i>Loving</i>, <i>Skinner</i> and <i>Pierce</i> and <i>Meyer</i> were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human <span title="966" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-966">p. 966</span>life, becomes significantly involved. The woman’s privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.</p>
<p id="fc0e7486-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.</p>
<p id="fc0e7487-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes “viable,” that is, potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.</p>
<p id="fc0e7488-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]hose in the [Catholic] Church would recognize the existence of life from the moment of conception. The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a “process” over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the “morning-after” pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs.</p>
<p id="fc0e7489-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a non-resident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes “compelling.”</p>
<p id="fc0e748a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the State’s important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the “compelling” point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of the now-established medical fact, referred to above, that until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is to perform <span title="967" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-967">p. 967</span>the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of the facility; and the like.</p>
<p id="fc0e748b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this “compelling” point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient’s pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.</p>
<p id="fc0e748c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the State’s important and legitimate interest in potential life, the “compelling” point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.</p>
<p id="fc0e748d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Measured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those “procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother,” sweeps too broadly. The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, “saving” the mother’s life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here.</p>

<p id="fc0e9ba4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The State may define the term “physician” to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.</p>
<p id="fc0e9ba5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc0e9ba6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="968" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-968">p. 968</span>I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of “privacy” is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not “private” in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the “privacy” that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy. Katz v. United States (1967).</p>
<p id="fc0e9ba7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Court means by the term “privacy” no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. (1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother’s life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective under the test stated in <i>Williamson.</i> But the Court’s sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court’s opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one. The decision here to break pregnancy into three distinct terms and to outline the permissible restrictions the State may impose in each one, for example, partakes more of judicial legislation than it does of a determination of the intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc0e9ba8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,” Snyder v. Massachusetts (1934).</p>
<p id="fc0e9ba9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857 and “has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.”</p>
<p id="fc0e9baa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter.</p>

<p id="fc0e9bab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="969" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-969">p. 969</span>By the 1990s, the change in the composition of the Supreme Court raised questions as to whether Roe v. Wade would be overruled. In 1989, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), four justices seemed poised to overrule <i>Roe.</i> A Missouri law declared the state’s view that life begins at conception, prohibited the use of government funds or facilities from performing or “encouraging or counseling” a woman to have an abortion, and allowed abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy only if a test was done to ensure that the fetus was not viable. The Supreme Court upheld the Missouri law, but without a majority opinion.</p>
<p id="fc0ec2bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Rehnquist, in a plurality opinion joined by Justices White and Kennedy, strongly criticized <i>Roe</i>. Rehnquist attacked the trimester distinctions that were used by <i>Roe</i> to balance the rights of the mother and the state’s interest in protecting the fetus. Rehnquist wrote, “[T]he rigid <i>Roe</i> framework is hardly consistent with the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms. . . . The key elements of the <i>Roe</i> framework—trimesters and viability—are not found in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one would expect to find a constitutional principle.”</p>
<p id="fc0ec2bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even more important, Rehnquist said, “[W]e do not see why the State’s interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability, and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing state regulation after viability, but prohibiting it before viability. . . . The State’s interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability.” Although Rehnquist’s opinion did not expressly urge the overruling of Roe v. Wade, that was the unmistakable implication of declaring that the state has a compelling interest in protecting fetal life from the moment of conception. Rehnquist and White were the two dissenters in <i>Roe</i>, and they had consistently argued for overruling it.</p>
<p id="fc0ec2be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Scalia wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. He said that the plurality opinion “effectively would overrule Roe v. Wade.” He said, “I think that should be done, but would do it more explicitly.” He argued that the failure to overrule <i>Roe</i> “needlessly . . . prolong[s] this Court’s self-awarded sovereignty over a field where it has little proper business since the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are political and not juridical.”</p>
<p id="fc0ec2bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor provided the fifth vote for the result in <i>Webster</i>, but she ruled only on the specifics of the Missouri law and did not opine on the question of whether <i>Roe</i> should be overruled. O’Connor noted that the Missouri law did not prohibit abortions and thus “there is no necessity to accept the state’s invitation to reexamine the constitutional validity of <i>Roe.</i>” She said that “[w]hen the constitutional invalidity of a State’s abortion statute actually turns on the constitutional validity of Roe v. Wade, there will be time enough to reexamine <i>Roe.</i> And to do so carefully.”</p>
<p id="fc0ec2c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent in <i>Webster</i> saw a Court on the verge of overruling <i>Roe.</i> Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall, lamented, “Today, Roe v. Wade and the fundamental constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, survive but are not secure. . . . [T]he plurality discards a landmark case of the last generation and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her right to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children. . . . For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed. For today, the women of this Nation still retain the liberty to <span title="970" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-970">p. 970</span>control their destinies. But the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.”</p>
<p id="fc0ec2c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between 1989, when <i>Webster</i> was decided, and 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey was before the Court, Justices Brennan and Marshall had resigned and were replaced, respectively, by Justices Souter and Thomas. It was thought that either of them, and particularly Justice Clarence Thomas, might cast the fifth vote to overrule Roe v. Wade. Indeed, the United States, through the solicitor general, urged the Court in <i>Casey</i> to use it as the occasion for overruling <i>Roe</i>. The Court, however, did not do so. But an unusual joint opinion by Justices O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter overruled the trimester distinctions used in <i>Roe</i> and also the use of strict scrutiny for evaluating government regulation of abortions. <i>Casey</i> remains the major case articulating current protections and constitutional standards for the right to abortion. Below are excerpts from <i>Casey</i> that discuss whether <i>Roe</i> should be overruled and the standard to be used in evaluating abortion laws. The discussion in <i>Casey</i> of specific types of regulation—such as waiting periods, spousal notification, and parental consent—is presented below as each of those issues is considered.</p>

<p id="fc0ee9d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v. Wade (1973), that definition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule <i>Roe.</i></p>
<p id="fc0ee9da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, as amended in 1988 and 1989. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent’s consent. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a “medical emergency,” which is defined in §3203 of the Act. In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="971" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-971">p. 971</span>[W]e acknowledge that our decisions after <i>Roe</i> cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, the Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of <i>Roe</i> and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. State and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by <i>Roe</i>, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <i>Roe</i>’s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State’s interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman’s effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State’s power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman’s life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.</p>

<p id="fc0ee9df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Constitutional protection of the woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Bill of Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill of Rights against the States. It is tempting, as a means of curbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that liberty encompasses no more than those rights already guaranteed to the individual against federal interference by the express provisions of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution. But of course this Court has never accepted that view.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. But such a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause in Loving v. Virginia (1967). Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States <span title="972" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-972">p. 972</span>at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit us to shrink from the duties of our office.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Our cases recognize “the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.” Eisenstadt v. Baird. Our precedents “have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on behalf of the State in the cases before us, arguments which in their ultimate formulation conclude that <i>Roe</i> should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of <i>Roe</i> are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combined with the force of stare decisis. We turn now to that doctrine.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc0ee9e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">III</p></div>
<p id="fc0ee9e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity, and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Cardozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society’s work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it. See B. Cardozo, <i>The Nature of the Judicial Process</i> 149 (1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable. At the other extreme, a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed. Rather, when this Court reexamines a prior holding, <span title="973" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-973">p. 973</span>its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So in this case we may enquire whether <i>Roe</i>’s central rule has been found unworkable; whether the rule’s limitation on state power could be removed without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it; whether the law’s growth in the intervening years has left <i>Roe</i>’s central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whether <i>Roe</i>’s premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevant or unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed.</p>
<p id="fc0ee9e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Roe</i> has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven “unworkable,” representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable. While <i>Roe</i> has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choice guaranteed against government infringement, and although the need for such review will remain as a consequence of today’s decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence.</p>
<p id="fc0f10f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule’s repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on the rule’s continued application. Abortion is customarily chosen as an unplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activity or to the failure of conventional birth control, and except on the assumption that no intercourse would have occurred but for <i>Roe</i>’s holding, such behavior may appear to justify no reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on that unrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance interest would be de minimis. This argument would be premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on <i>Roe</i> cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling <i>Roe</i> for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.</p>
<p id="fc0f10f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances of sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.</p>
<p id="fc0f10fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No evolution of legal principle has left <i>Roe</i>’s doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left <i>Roe</i> behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.</p>
<p id="fc0f10fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen how time has overtaken some of <i>Roe</i>’s factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of <i>Roe</i>’s central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State’s interest in <span title="974" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-974">p. 974</span>fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of <i>Roe</i>, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future. Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since <i>Roe</i> was decided; which is to say that no change in <i>Roe</i>’s factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc0f10fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">IV</p></div>
<p id="fc0f10fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in <i>Roe</i> was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman’s liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State’s interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.</p>
<p id="fc0f10fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That brings us, of course, to the point where much criticism has been directed at <i>Roe</i>, a criticism that always inheres when the Court draws a specific rule from what in the Constitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however, that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in the meaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear.</p>
<p id="fc0f10ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for two reasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of stare decisis. Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat arbitrary, but <i>Roe</i> was a reasoned statement, elaborated with great care. We have twice reaffirmed it in the face of great opposition.</p>
<p id="fc0f1100-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in <i>Roe</i>, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. Consistent with other constitutional norms, legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification. But courts may not. We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no line other than viability which is more workable. The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State’s intervention on behalf of the developing child. The woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.</p>
<p id="fc0f1101-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the equation is the interest of the State in the protection of potential life. The <i>Roe</i> Court recognized the State’s “important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.” The weight to be given this state interest, not the strength of the woman’s interest, was the difficult question <span title="975" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-975">p. 975</span>faced in <i>Roe.</i> We do not need to say whether each of us, had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of the state interest came before it as an original matter, would have concluded, as the <i>Roe</i> Court did, that its weight is insufficient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability even when it is subject to certain exceptions. The matter is not before us in the first instance, and coming as it does after nearly 20 years of litigation in <i>Roe</i>’s wake we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of <i>Roe</i>’s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding. And we have concluded that the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> should be reaffirmed.</p>
<p id="fc0f1102-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Roe</i> established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimester of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the woman’s health, but not to further the State’s interest in potential life, are permitted during the second trimester; and during the third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are permitted provided the life or health of the mother is not at stake.</p>
<p id="fc0f1103-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman’s right to choose not become so subordinate to the State’s interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however, that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this objective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessary and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the State’s permissible exercise of its powers.</p>
<p id="fc0f1104-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child herself. “‘[T]he Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth.’” It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we find consistent with <i>Roe</i>’s central premises, and indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.</p>
<p id="fc0f1105-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of <i>Roe.</i> Measures aimed at ensuring that a woman’s choice contemplates the consequences for the fetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized in <i>Roe</i>, although those measures have been found to be inconsistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in that case. A logical reading of the central holding in <i>Roe</i> itself, and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the woman and the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, require, in our view, that we abandon the trimester framework as a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed at the protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman’s interest; and in practice it undervalues the State’s interest in potential life, as recognized in <i>Roe.</i></p>
<p id="fc0f1106-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a right more difficult to exercise is, ipso facto, <span title="976" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-976">p. 976</span>an infringement of that right. An example clarifies the point. We have held that not every ballot access limitation amounts to an infringement of the right to vote. The abortion right is similar. Numerous forms of state regulation might have the incidental effect of increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of medical care, whether for abortion or any other medical procedure. The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman’s ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc0f1107-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on the right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy will be undue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State’s interest with the woman’s constitutionally protected liberty.</p>
<p id="fc0f1108-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman’s free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which, while furthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.</p>
<p id="fc0f1109-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman’s right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman’s exercise of the right to choose. Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden.</p>

<li class=""><p id="fc0f110c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the State’s profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures to ensure that the woman’s choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.

<p id="fc0f3824-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State restrictions on abortion violate a woman’s right of privacy in two ways. First, compelled continuation of a pregnancy infringes upon a woman’s right to bodily integrity by imposing substantial physical intrusions and significant risks of physical harm. During pregnancy, women experience dramatic physical changes and a wide range of health consequences. Labor and delivery pose additional health risks and physical demands. In short, restrictive abortion laws force women to endure physical invasions far more substantial than those this Court has held to violate the constitutional principle of bodily integrity in other contexts.</p>
<p id="fc0f3825-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, when the State restricts a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, it deprives a woman of the right to make her own decision about reproduction and family planning—critical life choices that this Court long has deemed central to the right to privacy. The decision to terminate or continue a pregnancy has no less an impact on a woman’s life than decisions about contraception or marriage. Because motherhood has a dramatic impact on a woman’s educational <span title="978" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-978">p. 978</span>prospects, employment opportunities, and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws deprive her of basic control over her life. For these reasons, “the decision whether or not to beget or bear a child” lies at “the very heart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices.”</p>
<p id="fc0f3826-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A State’s restrictions on a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of gender equality. State restrictions on abortion compel women to continue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. By restricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State conscripts women’s bodies into its service, forcing women to continue their pregnancies, suffer the pains of childbirth, and in most instances, provide years of maternal care. The State does not compensate women for their services; instead, it assumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. This assumption—that women can simply be forced to accept the “natural” status and incidents of motherhood—appears to rest upon a conception of women’s role that has triggered the protection of the Equal Protection Clause. The joint opinion recognizes that these assumptions about women’s place in society “are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fc0f3827-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has held that limitations on the right of privacy are permissible only if they survive “strict” constitutional scrutiny—that is, only if the governmental entity imposing the restriction can demonstrate that the limitation is both necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. We have applied this principle specifically in the context of abortion regulations.</p>
<p id="fc0f3828-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, application of this analytical framework is no less warranted than when it was approved by seven Members of this Court in <i>Roe.</i> Strict scrutiny of state limitations on reproductive choice still offers the most secure protection of the woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from state coercion. The factual premises of the trimester framework have not been undermined, and the <i>Roe</i> framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the “undue burden” standard adopted by the joint opinion.</p>
<p id="fc0f3829-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, <i>Roe</i>’s requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be disturbed. No other approach has gained a majority, and no other is more protective of the woman’s fundamental right. Lastly, no other approach properly accommodates the woman’s constitutional right with the State’s legitimate interests.</p>
<p id="fc0f382a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At long last, the Chief Justice and those who have joined him admit it. Gone are the contentions that the issue need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the first page, for all to see, is what was expected: “We believe that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.” If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opinion today, there is far more to fear from the Chief Justice’s opinion.</p>
<p id="fc0f382b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chief Justice’s criticism of <i>Roe</i> follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple physical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court’s personal-liberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particular rights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy. This constricted view is reinforced by the Chief Justice’s exclusive reliance on tradition as a source of fundamental rights. In the Chief Justice’s world, a woman considering whether to terminate a pregnancy is <span title="979" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-979">p. 979</span>entitled to no more protection than adulterers, murderers, and so-called “sexual deviates.” Given the Chief Justice’s exclusive reliance on tradition, people using contraceptives seem the next likely candidate for his list of outcasts.</p>
<p id="fc0f382c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even more shocking than the Chief Justice’s cramped notion of individual liberty is his complete omission of any discussion of the effects that compelled childbirth and motherhood have on women’s lives. Nor does the Chief Justice give any serious consideration to the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>
<p id="fc0f382d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman’s right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties. Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballot box.</p>
<p id="fc0f382e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one sense, the Court’s approach is worlds apart from that of the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia<span class="epub-small-caps">.</span> And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approaches is short—the distance is but a single vote.</p>

<p id="fc0f3831-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The joint opinion, following its newly minted variation on stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v. Wade (1973), but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case. We believe that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Roe v. Wade, the Court recognized a “guarantee of personal privacy” which “is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” We are now of the view that, in terming this right fundamental, the Court in <i>Roe</i> read the earlier opinions upon which it based its decision much too broadly. Unlike marriage, procreation, and contraception, abortion “involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.” The abortion decision must therefore “be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy.” One cannot ignore the fact that a woman is not isolated in her pregnancy, and that the decision to abort necessarily involves the destruction of a fetus.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do the historical traditions of the American people support the view that the right to terminate one’s pregnancy is “fundamental.” The common law which we inherited from England made abortion after “quickening” an offense. At the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, statutory prohibitions or restrictions on abortion were commonplace; in 1868, at least 28 of the then-37 States and 8 Territories had statutes banning or limiting abortion. J. Mohr, <i>Abortion in America</i> 200 (1978). By the turn of the century virtually every State had a law prohibiting or restricting abortion on its books. By the middle of the present century, a liberalization trend had set in. But 21 of the restrictive abortion laws in effect in 1868 were still in effect in 1973 when <i>Roe</i> was decided, and an overwhelming majority of the States prohibited abortion <span title="980" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-980">p. 980</span>unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. On this record, it can scarcely be said that any deeply rooted tradition of relatively unrestricted abortion in our history supported the classification of the right to abortion as “fundamental” under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think, therefore, both in view of this history and of our decided cases dealing with substantive liberty under the Due Process Clause, that the Court was mistaken in <i>Roe</i> when it classified a woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy as a “fundamental right” that could be abridged only in a manner which withstood “strict scrutiny.”</p>
<p id="fc0f5f45-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White,</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989). The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is, quite simply, the issue in these cases: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a “liberty” in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both. The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not. I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views concerning the “concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protected—because of two simple facts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s description of the place of <i>Roe</i> in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did <i>Roe</i> not, as the Court suggests, resolve the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish it, by elevating it to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve. National politics were not plagued by abortion protests, national abortion lobbying, or abortion marches on Congress before Roe v. Wade was decided. Profound disagreement existed among our citizens over the issue—as it does over other issues, such as the death penalty—but that disagreement was being worked out at the state level. As with many other issues, the division of sentiment within each State was not as closely balanced as it was among the population of the Nation as a whole, meaning not only that more people would be satisfied with the results of state-by-state resolution, but also that those results would be more stable. Pre-<i>Roe,</i> moreover, political compromise was possible.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f49-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Roe</i>’s mandate for abortion on demand destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. At the same time, <i>Roe</i> created a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion proponents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attached to the act. (“If the Constitution guarantees abortion, how can it be bad?”—not an accurate line of thought, but a natural one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is not for me to say that they are wrong. But to portray <i>Roe</i> as the statesmanlike “settlement” of a <span title="981" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-981">p. 981</span>divisive issue, a jurisprudential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is nothing less than Orwellian. <i>Roe</i> fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since.</p>
<p id="fc0f5f4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a poignant aspect to today’s opinion. Its length, and what might be called its epic tone, suggest that its authors believe they are bringing to an end a troublesome era in the history of our Nation and of our Court. “It is the dimension” of authority, they say, to “cal[l] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fc0f5f4b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There comes vividly to mind a portrait by Emanuel Leutze that hangs in the Harvard Law School: Roger Brooke Taney, painted in 1859, the 82d year of his life, the 24th of his Chief Justiceship, the second after his opinion in <i>Dred Scott</i>. He is all in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanging limply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair. He sits facing the viewer and staring straight out. There seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment. Perhaps he always looked that way, even when dwelling upon the happiest of thoughts. But those of us who know how the lustre of his great Chief Justiceship came to be eclipsed by <i>Dred Scott</i> cannot help believing that he had that case—its already apparent consequences for the Court and its soon-to-be-played-out consequences for the Nation—burning on his mind. I expect that two years earlier he, too, had thought himself “call[ing] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fc0f5f4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no more realistic for us in this litigation, than it was for him in that, to think that an issue of the sort they both involved—an issue involving life and death, freedom and subjugation—can be “speedily and finally settled” by the Supreme Court, as President James Buchanan in his inaugural address said the issue of slavery in the territories would be. Quite to the contrary, by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish. We should get out of this area, where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining.</p>

Hellerstedt (2016), in a 5-3 decision, struck down a Texas law imposing restrictions on abortion. By contrast, Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), in a 5-4 decision, upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Act. Both use the undue burden test, although they come to very different results.</p>

<p id="fc0fd49d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with the standard, as described in <i>Casey.</i> We recognize that the “State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient.” But, we added, “a statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.” Moreover, “[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.”</p>
<p id="fc0fd49e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals wrote that a state law is “constitutional if: (1) it does not have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus; and (2) it is reasonably related to (or designed to further) a legitimate state interest.” The Court of Appeals went on to hold that “the district court erred by substituting its own judgment for that of the legislature” when it conducted its “undue burden inquiry,” in part because “medical uncertainty underlying a statute is for resolution by legislatures, not the courts.”</p>
<p id="fc0fd49f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals’ articulation of the relevant standard is incorrect. The first part of the Court of Appeals’ test may be read to imply that a district court should not consider the existence or nonexistence of medical benefits when considering whether a regulation of abortion constitutes an undue burden. The rule announced in <i>Casey,</i> however, requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer. And the second part of the test is wrong to equate the judicial review applicable to the regulation of a constitutionally protected personal liberty with the less strict review applicable where, for example, economic legislation is at issue.</p>
<p id="fc0fd4a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statement that legislatures, and not courts, must resolve questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this Court’s case law. Instead, the Court, when determining the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion <span title="985" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-985">p. 985</span>procedures, has placed considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in judicial proceedings.</p>
<p id="fc0fd4a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a district court to give significant weight to evidence in the judicial record in these circumstances is consistent with this Court’s case law. As we shall describe, the District Court did so here. It did not simply substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature. It considered the evidence in the record—including expert evidence, presented in stipulations, depositions, and testimony. It then weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens. We hold that, in so doing, the District Court applied the correct legal standard.</p>

<p id="fc0ffbb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the lower courts’ evaluation of the evidence, we first consider the admitting-privileges requirement. The purpose of the admitting-privileges requirement is to help ensure that women have easy access to a hospital should complications arise during an abortion procedure. But the District Court found that it brought about no such health-related benefit. The court found that “[t]he great weight of evidence demonstrates that, before the act’s passage, abortion in Texas was extremely safe with particularly low rates of serious complications and virtually no deaths occurring on account of the procedure.” Thus, there was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We add that, when directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case. This answer is consistent with the findings of the other Federal District Courts that have considered the health benefits of other States’ similar admitting-privileges laws.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, the record evidence indicates that the admitting-privileges requirement places a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice.” The District Court found, as of the time the admitting-privileges requirement began to be enforced, the number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half, from about 40 to about 20. Eight abortion clinics closed in the months leading up to the requirement’s effective date. Eleven more closed on the day the admitting-privileges requirement took effect.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other evidence helps to explain why the new requirement led to the closure of clinics. We read that other evidence in light of a brief filed in this Court by the Society of Hospital Medicine. That brief describes the undisputed general fact that “hospitals often condition admitting privileges on reaching a certain number of admissions per year.” In a word, doctors would be unable to maintain admitting privileges or obtain those privileges for the future, because the fact that abortions are so safe meant that providers were unlikely to have any patients to admit.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the record contains sufficient evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement led to the closure of half of Texas’ clinics, or thereabouts. Those closures meant fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding.</p>

<p id="fc0ffbbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second challenged provision of Texas’ new law sets forth the surgical-center requirement. Prior to enactment of the new requirement, Texas law required abortion facilities to meet a host of health and safety requirements.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is considerable evidence in the record supporting the District Court’s findings indicating that the statutory provision requiring all abortion facilities to meet all surgical-center standards does not benefit patients and is not necessary. The District Court found that “risks are not appreciably lowered for patients who undergo abortions at ambulatory surgical centers as compared to nonsurgical-center facilities.” The court added that women “will not obtain better care or experience more frequent positive outcomes at an ambulatory surgical center as compared to a previously licensed facility.” And these findings are well supported.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is that this record evidence, along with the absence of any evidence to the contrary, provides ample support for the District Court’s conclusion that “[m]any of the building standards mandated by the act and its implementing rules have such a tangential relationship to patient safety in the context of abortion as to be nearly arbitrary.” That conclusion, along with the supporting evidence, provides sufficient support for the more general conclusion that the surgical-center requirement “will not [provide] better care or . . . more frequent positive outcomes.” The record evidence thus supports the ultimate legal conclusion that the surgical-center requirement is not necessary.</p>
<p id="fc0ffbbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, the record provides adequate evidentiary support for the District Court’s conclusion that the surgical-center requirement places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. The parties stipulated that the requirement would further reduce the number of abortion facilities available to seven or eight facilities, located in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas/Fort Worth. In the District Court’s view, the proposition that these “seven or eight providers could meet the demand of the entire State stretches credulity.” We take this statement as a finding that these few facilities could not “meet” that “demand.”</p>
<p id="fc0ffbbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he challenged provisions of H.B. 2 close most of the abortion facilities in Texas and place added stress on those facilities able to remain open. They vastly increase the obstacles confronting women seeking abortions in Texas without providing any benefit to women’s health capable of withstanding any meaningful scrutiny. The provisions are unconstitutional on their face.</p>

<p id="fc1022d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Texas law called H.B. 2 inevitably will reduce the number of clinics and doctors allowed to provide abortion services. Texas argues that H.B. 2’s restrictions are constitutional because they protect the health of women who experience complications from abortions. In truth, “complications from an abortion are both rare and rarely dangerous.” Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory-surgical-center or hospital admitting-privileges requirements. Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H.B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law “would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.”</p>

<p id="fc1022d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court strikes down two state statutory provisions in all of their applications, at the behest of abortion clinics and doctors. That decision exemplifies the Court’s troubling tendency “to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even to speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue.”</p>
<p id="fc1022d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court’s abortion jurisprudence. Even taking <i>Casey</i> as the baseline, however, the majority radically rewrites the undue-burden test in three ways. First, today’s decision requires courts to “consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” Second, today’s opinion tells the courts that, when the law’s justifications are medically uncertain, they need not defer to the legislature, and must instead assess medical justifications for abortion restrictions by scrutinizing the record themselves. Finally, even if a law imposes no “substantial obstacle” to women’s access to abortions, the law now must have more than a “reasonabl[e] relat[ion] to . . . a legitimate state interest.” These precepts are nowhere to be found in <i>Casey</i> or its successors, and transform the undue-burden test to something much more akin to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fc1022d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision will prompt some to claim victory, just as it will stiffen opponents’ will to object. But the entire Nation has lost something essential.

<p id="fc1022d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000), the Supreme Court, in a five-to-four decision, invalidated a Nebraska law prohibiting so-called partial-birth abortion. The law made it a crime to remove a living fetus or a substantial part of a living fetus with the intent of ending the fetus’s life. The Court found the law unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception and because it would have prohibited many forms of abortions.</p>
<p id="fc1022da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 lacks a health exception and seems broader than what the Court said it would uphold in <i>Stenberg.</i> A crucial difference, of course, is that when the Court heard the <i>Gonzales</i> case, Justice O’Connor, a part of the majority in <i>Stenberg</i>, had been replaced by Justice Alito.</p>

<p id="fc1049f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act proscribes a particular manner of ending fetal life, so it is necessary here, as it was in <i>Stenberg</i>, to discuss abortion procedures in some detail. Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child’s development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU-486), to terminate the pregnancy. The Act does not regulate these procedures.</p>
<p id="fc1049f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester. The surgical procedure referred to as “dilation and evacuation” or “D&amp;E” is the usual abortion method in this trimester. Although individual techniques for performing D&amp;E differ, the general steps are the same.</p>
<p id="fc1049f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman’s cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed.</p>
<p id="fc1049f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. <span title="989" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-989">p. 989</span>Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus’ body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit.</p>
<p id="fc1049f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on “partial-birth abortion,” including the Act, is a variation of this standard D&amp;E. The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D&amp;E variation. It has been referred to as “intact D&amp;E,” “dilation and extraction” (D&amp;X), and “intact D&amp;X.” For discussion purposes this D&amp;E variation will be referred to as intact D&amp;E. The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D&amp;E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes. There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D&amp;Es are performed in this manner.</p>
<p id="fc1049f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intact D&amp;E, like regular D&amp;E, begins with dilation of the cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure. In an intact D&amp;E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified: “‘[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening. The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.’”</p>
<p id="fc1049fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an abortion doctor’s clinical description. Dr. Haskell’s approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and “the process has evolved” since his presentation. Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced “so that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.” Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus’ skull. Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it.</p>
<p id="fc1049fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">D&amp;E and intact D&amp;E are not the only second-trimester abortion methods. Doctors also may abort a fetus through medical induction. The doctor medicates the woman to induce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus. Induction, which unlike D&amp;E should occur in a hospital, can last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48. It accounts for about five percent of second-trimester abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those after 20 weeks. Doctors turn to two other methods of second-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy, only in emergency situations because they carry increased risk of complications. In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean section, the doctor removes the fetus by making an incision through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access to the uterine cavity. A hysterectomy requires the removal of the entire uterus. These two procedures represent about .07% of second-trimester abortions.</p>

<p id="fc1049fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the time of the <i>Stenberg</i> decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed to prohibit the procedure. In 2003, after this Court’s decision in <i>Stenberg</i>, Congress passed the Act at issue here.</p>
<p id="fc1049fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act responded to <i>Stenberg</i> in two ways. First, Congress made factual findings.

<p id="fc107118-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We assume the following principles for the purposes of this opinion. Before viability, a State “may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy.” It also may not impose upon this right an undue burden, which exists if a regulation’s “purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.” On the other hand, “[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman’s exercise of the right to choose.” <span title="991" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-991">p. 991</span>Planned Parenthood v.

<p id="fc10711a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is not invalid on its face.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc10711b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fc10711c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act punishes “knowingly perform[ing]” a “partial-birth abortion.” It defines the unlawful abortion in explicit terms. First, the person performing the abortion must “vaginally delive[r] a living fetus.” The Act does not restrict an abortion procedure involving the delivery of an expired fetus. The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal delivery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy). The Act does apply both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.</p>
<p id="fc10711d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Act’s definition of partial-birth abortion requires the fetus to be delivered “until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.” The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living fetus to one of these “anatomical ‘landmarks’”—where, depending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother—the prohibitions of the Act do not apply.</p>
<p id="fc10711e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an “overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.” For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act causing the fetus’ death must be separate from delivery. And the overt act must occur after the delivery to an anatomical landmark.</p>
<p id="fc10711f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion. To begin with, the physician must have “deliberately and intentionally” delivered the fetus to one of the Act’s anatomical landmarks. If a living fetus is delivered past the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inapplicable. In addition, the fetus must have been delivered “for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].” If either intent is absent, no crime has occurred. This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent the requisite state of mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc107120-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">B</p></div>
<p id="fc109831-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad. A review of the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach. The Act prohibits intact D&amp;E; and, notwithstanding respondents’ arguments, it does not prohibit the D&amp;E procedure in which the fetus is removed in parts.</p>
<p id="fc109832-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D&amp;E. The Act excludes most D&amp;Es in which the fetus is removed in pieces, not intact. <span title="992" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-992">p. 992</span>If the doctor intends to remove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not have the requisite intent to incur criminal liability. Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate the Act because the doctor will not have delivered the living fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or committed an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial delivery.</p>
<p id="fc109833-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> confirms this point. The statute in <i>Stenberg</i> prohibited “‘deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.’” The Court concluded that this statute encompassed D&amp;E because “D&amp;E will often involve a physician pulling a ‘substantial portion’ of a still living fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus.”</p>
<p id="fc109834-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in <i>Stenberg</i>. It adopts the phrase “delivers a living fetus,” instead of “‘delivering . . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof.’”</p>
<p id="fc109835-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered also differentiates the Act from the statute at issue in <i>Stenberg</i>. The Court in <i>Stenberg</i> interpreted “‘substantial portion’” of the fetus to include an arm or a leg. The Act’s anatomical landmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited. The landmarks also require the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially “outside the body of the mother.” To come within the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be outside the body of the mother before a doctor could face criminal sanctions.</p>
<p id="fc109836-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought further to meet the Court’s objections to the state statute considered in <i>Stenberg</i>. The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-birth abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the fetus. The fatal overt act must occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, and it must be something “other than [the] completion of delivery.” This distinction matters because, unlike intact D&amp;E, standard D&amp;E does not involve a delivery followed by a fatal act.</p>

<p id="fc109838-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional “if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.” The abortions affected by the Act’s regulations take place both previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are applicable. The question is whether the Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions. The Act does not on its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial challenge to its validity.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<span title="993" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-993">p. 993</span><div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc109839-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">a</p></div>
<p id="fc10983a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act’s purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its operative provisions. A description of the prohibited abortion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congressional enactment. The Act proscribes a method of abortion in which a fetus is killed just inches before completion of the birth process. Congress stated as follows: “Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life.” The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life.</p>
<p id="fc10983b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act’s ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government’s objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D&amp;E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life.</p>
<p id="fc10983c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child. The Act recognizes this reality as well. Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision. While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.</p>
<p id="fc10983d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the human form.</p>
<p id="fc10983e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus reducing the absolute number of late-term abortions. The medical profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second trimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand. The State’s interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.</p>
<p id="fc10983f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is objected that the standard D&amp;E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D&amp;E, so that the legislation accomplishes little. What we have already said, however, shows ample justification for the regulation. Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard D&amp;E because the former occurs when the fetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of the Act’s anatomical landmarks. It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&amp;E, “undermines the public’s perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world.”</p>

<p id="fc109841-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act’s furtherance of legitimate government interests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question: whether the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right because it does not allow use of the barred procedure where “‘necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for <span title="994" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-994">p. 994</span>[the] preservation of the . . . health of the mother.’” The prohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under precedents we here assume to be controlling, if it “subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.” [W]hether the Act creates significant health risks for women has been a contested factual question. The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their position.</p>
<p id="fc109842-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents presented evidence that intact D&amp;E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <i>Stenberg</i>. Abortion doctors testified, for example, that intact D&amp;E decreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perforation because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with surgical instruments and does not require the removal of bony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that may be sharp. Respondents also presented evidence that intact D&amp;E was safer both because it reduces the risks that fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it takes less time to complete. Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that intact D&amp;E was safer for women with certain medical conditions or women with fetuses that had certain anomalies.</p>
<p id="fc109843-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified in the District Courts and before Congress. They concluded that the alleged health advantages were based on speculation without scientific studies to support them. They considered D&amp;E always to be a safe alternative.</p>
<p id="fc109844-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is documented medical disagreement whether the Act’s prohibition would ever impose significant health risks on women.</p>
<p id="fc10be55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question becomes whether the Act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists. The Court’s precedents instruct that the Act can survive this facial attack. The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p id="fc10be56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This traditional rule is consistent with <i>Casey</i>, which confirms the State’s interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy. Physicians are not entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use reasonable alternative procedures. The law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community.</p>
<p id="fc10be57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts. The medical uncertainty over whether the Act’s prohibition creates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.</p>
<p id="fc10be58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue burden is supported by other considerations. Alternatives are available to the prohibited procedure. As we have noted, the Act does not proscribe D&amp;E. If the intact D&amp;E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.</p>

In an as-applied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.</p>
<p id="fc10be5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the previous sections of this opinion explain, respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases.

<p id="fc10be63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In keeping with this comprehension of the right to reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in all cases, safeguard a woman’s health. We have thus ruled that a State must avoid subjecting women to health risks not only where the pregnancy itself creates danger, but also where state regulation forces women to resort to less safe methods of abortion.</p>
<p id="fc10be64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adolescents and indigent women, research suggests, are more likely than other women to have difficulty obtaining an abortion during the first trimester <span title="996" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-996">p. 996</span>of pregnancy. Minors may be unaware they are pregnant until relatively late in pregnancy, while poor women’s financial constraints are an obstacle to timely receipt of services. Severe fetal anomalies and health problems confronting the pregnant woman are also causes of second-trimester abortions; many such conditions cannot be diagnosed or do not develop until the second trimester.</p>
<p id="fc10be65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Stenberg</i>, we expressly held that a statute banning intact D&amp;E was unconstitutional in part because it lacked a health exception. We noted that there existed a “division of medical opinion” about the relative safety of intact D&amp;E, but we made clear that as long as “substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women’s health,” a health exception is required.</p>

<p id="fc10be67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2003, a few years after our ruling in <i>Stenberg</i>, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act—without an exception for women’s health. The congressional findings on which the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act rests do not withstand inspection, as the lower courts have determined and this Court is obliged to concede. Many of the Act’s recitations are incorrect. For example, Congress determined that no medical schools provide instruction on intact D&amp;E. But in fact, numerous leading medical schools teach the procedure. More important, Congress claimed there was a medical consensus that the banned procedure is never necessary. But the evidence “very clearly demonstrate[d] the opposite.”</p>
<p id="fc10e578-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, Congress found that “[t]here is no credible medical evidence that partial-birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion procedures.” But the congressional record includes letters from numerous individual physicians stating that pregnant women’s health would be jeopardized under the Act, as well as statements from nine professional associations, including ACOG, the American Public Health Association, and the California Medical Association, attesting that intact D&amp;E carries meaningful safety advantages over other methods.</p>

<p id="fc10e57a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to Congress, the District Courts made findings after full trials at which all parties had the opportunity to present their best evidence. The courts had the benefit of “much more extensive medical and scientific evidence . . . concerning the safety and necessity of intact D&amp;Es.” During the District Court trials, “numerous” “extraordinarily accomplished” and “very experienced” medical experts explained that, in certain circumstances and for certain women, intact D&amp;E is safer than alternative procedures and necessary to protect women’s health.</p>
<p id="fc10e57b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the expert testimony plaintiffs introduced, the safety advantages of intact D&amp;E are marked for women with certain medical conditions, for example, uterine scarring, bleeding disorders, heart disease, or compromised immune systems. Further, plaintiffs’ experts testified that intact D&amp;E is significantly safer for women with certain pregnancy-related conditions, such as placenta previa and accreta, and for women carrying fetuses with certain abnormalities, such as severe hydrocephalus.</p>
<p id="fc10e57c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intact D&amp;E, plaintiffs’ experts explained, provides safety benefits over D&amp;E by dismemberment for several reasons: First, intact D&amp;E minimizes the number of times a physician must insert instruments through the cervix and into <span title="997" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-997">p. 997</span>the uterus, and thereby reduces the risk of trauma to, and perforation of, the cervix and uterus—the most serious complication associated with nonintact D&amp;E. Second, removing the fetus intact, instead of dismembering it in utero, decreases the likelihood that fetal tissue will be retained in the uterus, a condition that can cause infection, hemorrhage, and infertility. Third, intact D&amp;E diminishes the chances of exposing the patient’s tissues to sharp bony fragments sometimes resulting from dismemberment of the fetus. Fourth, intact D&amp;E takes less operating time than D&amp;E by dismemberment, and thus may reduce bleeding, the risk of infection, and complications relating to anesthesia.</p>
<p id="fc10e57d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on thoroughgoing review of the trial evidence and the congressional record, each of the District Courts to consider the issue rejected Congress’ findings as unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The trial courts concluded, in contrast to Congress’ findings, that “significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D&amp;E] is the safest procedure.” The District Courts’ findings merit this Court’s respect.</p>

<p id="fc10e57f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court offers flimsy and transparent justifications for upholding a nationwide ban on intact D&amp;E sans any exception to safeguard a women’s health. Today’s ruling, the Court declares, advances “a premise central to [<i>Casey</i>’s] conclusion”—i.e., the Government’s “legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.” But the Act scarcely furthers that interest: The law saves not a single fetus from destruction, for it targets only a method of performing abortion. And surely the statute was not designed to protect the lives or health of pregnant women. In short, the Court upholds a law that, while doing nothing to “preserv[e] . . . fetal life,” bars a woman from choosing intact D&amp;E although her doctor “reasonably believes [that procedure] will best protect [her].”</p>
<p id="fc10e580-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As another reason for upholding the ban, the Court emphasizes that the Act does not proscribe the nonintact D&amp;E procedure. But why not, one might ask. Nonintact D&amp;E could equally be characterized as “brutal,” involving as it does “tear[ing] [a fetus] apart” and “ripp[ing] off” its limbs. “[T]he notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures . . . is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply irrational.”</p>
<p id="fc10e581-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, the Court admits that “moral concerns” are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortion. Notably, the concerns expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government’s interest in preserving life. By allowing such concerns to carry the day and case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent. Revealing in this regard, the Court invokes an antiabortion shibboleth for which it concededly has no reliable evidence: Women who have abortions come to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from “[s]evere depression and loss of esteem.” Because of women’s fragile emotional state and because of the “bond of love the mother has for her child,” the Court worries, doctors may withhold information about the nature of the intact D&amp;E procedure. The solution the Court approves, then, is not to require doctors to inform women, accurately and adequately, of <span title="998" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-998">p. 998</span>the different procedures and their attendant risks. Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11181_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11181_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">21</a></span></p>
<p id="fc10e583-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women’s place in the family and under the Constitution—ideas that have long since been discredited. Though today’s majority may regard women’s feelings on the matter as “self-evident,” this Court has repeatedly confirmed that “[t]he destiny of the woman must be shaped . . . on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.”</p>
<p id="fc10e584-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One wonders how long a line that saves no fetus from destruction will hold in face of the Court’s “moral concerns.” The Court’s hostility to the right <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> secured is not concealed. Throughout, the opinion refers to obstetrician-gynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions not by the titles of their medical specialties, but by the pejorative label “abortion doctor.” A fetus is described as an “unborn child,” and as a “baby,” second-trimester, previability abortions are referred to as “late-term,” and the reasoned medical judgments of highly trained doctors are dismissed as “preferences” motivated by “mere convenience.” Instead of the heightened scrutiny we have previously applied, the Court determines that a “rational” ground is enough to uphold the Act. And, most troubling, <i>Casey</i>’s principles, confirming the continuing vitality of “the essential holding of <i>Roe</i>,” are merely “assume[d]” for the moment, rather than “retained” or “reaffirmed.”</p>

<p id="fc110c96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without attempting to distinguish <i>Stenberg</i> and earlier decisions, the majority asserts that the Act survives review because respondents have not shown that the ban on intact D&amp;E would be unconstitutional “in a large fraction of relevant cases.” But <i>Casey</i> makes clear that, in determining whether any restriction poses an undue burden on a “large fraction” of women, the relevant class is not “all women,” nor “all pregnant women,” nor even all women “seeking abortions.” Rather, a provision restricting access to abortion, “must be judged by reference to those [women] for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction.” Thus the absence of a health exception burdens all women for whom it is relevant—women who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D&amp;E because other procedures would place their health at risk. It makes no sense to conclude that this facial challenge fails because respondents have not shown that a health exception is necessary for a large fraction of second-trimester abortions, including those for which a health exception is unnecessary: The very purpose of a health <i>exception</i> is to protect women in <i>exceptional</i> cases.</p>
<p id="fc110c97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of today’s opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose entirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. “The Act is open,” the Court states, “to a proper as-applied challenge in a <span title="999" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-999">p. 999</span>discrete case.” Surely the Court cannot mean that no suit may be brought until a woman’s health is immediately jeopardized by the ban on intact D&amp;E. A woman “suffer[ing] from medical complications[]” needs access to the medical procedure at once and cannot wait for the judicial process to unfold.</p>
<p id="fc110c98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s allowance only of an “as-applied challenge in a discrete case,” jeopardizes women’s health and places doctors in an untenable position. Even if courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piecemeal litigation for “discrete and well-defined instances,” women whose circumstances have not been anticipated by prior litigation could well be left unprotected. In treating those women, physicians would risk criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they exercise their best judgment as to the safest medical procedure for their patients. The Court is thus gravely mistaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are “the proper manner to protect the health of the woman.”</p>
<p id="fc110c99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite simply, irrational. The Court’s defense of the statute provides no saving explanation. In candor, the Act, and the Court’s defense of it, cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court—and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women’s lives. When “a statute burdens constitutional rights and all that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those rights, the burden is undue.”</p>
<p id="fc110c9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another type of government regulation of abortion is waiting periods. Prior to <i>Casey</i>, the Supreme Court had invalidated waiting periods for adult women’s abortions. In City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983), the Court declared unconstitutional a part of a city ordinance that prohibited a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant woman signed a consent form. Justice Powell, writing for the Court, explained that the city had “failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period. There is no evidence suggesting that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely. Nor are we convinced that the State’s legitimate concern that the woman’s decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.”</p>

</div></div>

<p id="fc110c9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court used the undue burden test, rather than strict scrutiny as in <i>Akron</i>, and upheld the constitutionality of a waiting period. In fact, the joint opinion in <i>Casey</i> reviewed the invalidation of the waiting period in <i>Akron</i> and declared, “We consider that conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable, particularly where the statute directs that important information become part of the background of the decision.”</p>
<p id="fc110c9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The joint opinion in <i>Casey</i> argued that a waiting period is not an undue burden on access to abortion. The joint opinion acknowledged that the district court had found that because of travel and scheduling problems there often would be more than a day’s delay before an abortion could be received and thus that waiting periods would increase the cost and risks of abortions. But the joint opinion concluded that 24-hour waiting periods are constitutional. <span title="1000" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1000">p. 1000</span>It declared, “Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is permitted to enact persuasive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a health interest. And while the waiting period does limit a physician’s discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to invalidate it.” The four justices who favored overruling <i>Roe</i>—Rehnquist, White, Scalia, and Thomas—provided the other votes necessary to uphold the waiting period requirement.</p>
<p id="fc110c9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet another type of government regulation of abortion are so-called informed consent requirements. The Supreme Court has had several occasions to consider “informed consent” requirements—laws that require that women be advised about the fetus and its characteristics at that stage of pregnancy. Again, prior to <i>Casey</i>, the Supreme Court had consistently invalidated these requirements, but after <i>Casey</i> they are much more likely to be upheld.</p>
<p id="fc110c9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, cited above, the Supreme Court also declared unconstitutional a part of a city ordinance that required that physicians inform women seeking abortions about the development of her fetus, that the “unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception,” the date of possible viability, and the physical and emotional consequences that may result from an abortion. The Court said that “much of the information required is designed not to inform the woman’s consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether. . . . By insisting upon recitation of a lengthy and inflexible list of information, Akron unreasonably has placed obstacles in the path of the doctor upon whom the woman is entitled to rely for advice in connection with her decision.”</p>
<p id="fc110c9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists (1986), the Court invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required, in part, that women be given seven different kinds of information at least 24 hours before they give consent for abortions. These included telling the woman that there may be unforeseeable detrimental physical and psychological effects to having an abortion, the possible availability of prenatal and childbirth medical care, and the father’s liability to pay child support. Also, the physician had to inform the woman of the availability of printed materials that describe the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the “unborn child” at two-week gestational increments. The Court said that, as in <i>Akron</i>, the Pennsylvania law was unconstitutional because it was motivated by a desire to discourage women from having abortions and because it imposed a rigid requirement that a specific body of information be communicated regardless of the needs of the patient or the judgment of the physician.</p>
<p id="fc110ca0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Casey</i>, however, the Court upheld a provision virtually identical to that invalidated in <i>Thornburgh</i>, and the joint opinion said, “To the extent <i>Akron I</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> find a constitutional violation where the government requires . . . the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the nature of the abortion procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the ‘probable gestational age’ of the fetus, those cases are inconsistent with <i>Roe</i>’s acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled.” Specifically, the Court upheld a section of the statute that required that women be told information and that they be informed of the availability of other materials that describe the fetus, provide information about medical care for childbirth, and that list adoption providers.</p>
<p id="fc110ca1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1001" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1001">p. 1001</span>The shift from <i>Akron</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> to <i>Casey</i> reflects the Court’s abandoning the position that the state may not regulate abortions in a way to encourage childbirth. The issue that <i>Casey</i> leaves unresolved is how far the government can go in this direction in the form of informed consent laws. For example, do <i>Akron</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> remain good law in that the government could not require that women be given detailed descriptions of the fetus, or shown photographs, or told that human life begins at conception? There is a strong argument that all of these go much further than the Pennsylvania law in <i>Casey</i> and thus that the Court might find them to be an undue burden on access to abortion.</p>

<p id="fc1133bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A regulation of the Connecticut Welfare Department limits state Medicaid benefits for first trimester abortions to those that are “medically necessary,” a term defined to include psychiatric necessity. In this case, we must decide whether the Constitution requires a participating State to pay for nontherapeutic abortions when it pays for childbirth.</p>
<p id="fc1133bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigents. But when a State decides to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty by providing medical care, the manner in which it dispenses benefits is subject to constitutional limitations. Appellees’ claim is that Connecticut must accord equal treatment to both abortion and childbirth, and may not evidence a policy preference by funding only the medical expenses incident to childbirth. This challenge to the classifications established by the Connecticut regulation presents a question arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc1133bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves no discrimination against a suspect class. An indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases. Nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who cannot pay lead to a different conclusion. In a sense, every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or services. But this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. Accordingly, the central question in this case is whether the regulation “impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fc1133be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1002" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1002">p. 1002</span>Roe v. Wade can be understood only by considering both the woman’s interest and the nature of the State’s interference with it. <i>Roe</i> did not declare an unqualified “constitutional right to an abortion,” as the District Court seemed to think. Rather, the right protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. It implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.</p>
<p id="fc1133bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles absolute or otherwise in the pregnant woman’s path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut’s decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman’s decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficult and in some cases, perhaps, impossible for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation. We conclude that the Connecticut regulation does not impinge upon the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe.</i> Our conclusion signals no retreat from <i>Roe</i> or the cases applying it. There is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.</p>
<p id="fc1133c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We certainly are not unsympathetic to the plight of an indigent woman who desires an abortion, but “the Constitution does not provide judicial remedies for every social and economic ill.” Our cases uniformly have accorded the States a wider latitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds.</p>
<p id="fc1133c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision whether to expend state funds for nontherapeutic abortion is fraught with judgments of policy and value over which opinions are sharply divided. Our conclusion that the Connecticut regulation is constitutional is not based on a weighing of its wisdom or social desirability, for this Court does not strike down state laws “because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.” Indeed, when an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated by public funding of nontherapeutic abortions, the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature. We should not forget that “legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.”</p>
<p id="fc1133c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc115ad3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A distressing insensitivity to the plight of impoverished pregnant women is inherent in the Court’s analysis. The stark reality for too many, not just “some,” indigent pregnant women is that indigency makes access to competent licensed physicians not merely “difficult” but “impossible.” As a practical matter, many indigent women will feel they have no choice but to carry their pregnancies to term because the State will pay for the associated medical services, even though they would have chosen to have abortions if the State had also provided funds for that procedure, or indeed if the State had provided funds for neither procedure. This disparity in funding by the State clearly operates to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children they would not otherwise choose to have, and <span title="1003" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1003">p. 1003</span>just as clearly, this coercion can only operate upon the poor, who are uniquely the victims of this form of financial pressure. Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s words are apt: “To sanction such a ruthless consequence, inevitably resulting from a money hurdle erected by the State, would justify a latter-day Anatole France to add one more item to his ironic comments on the ‘majestic equality’ of the law. ‘The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.’ . . .” Griffin v. Illinois (1956) (concurring opinion).</p>

<p id="fc115ad4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In two companion cases to <i>Maher</i>, the Court upheld other restrictions on funding for nontherapeutic abortions. In Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977), the Supreme Court held that the federal Medicaid Act did not require that states fund nontherapeutic first-trimester abortions as part of participating in the joint federal-state program. In Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977), the Court found that it was constitutional for a city to refuse to pay for nontherapeutic first-trimester abortions in its public hospital.</p>
<p id="fc115ad5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1980, the Supreme Court went further and upheld the constitutionality of laws that denied public funding for medically necessary abortions except where necessary to save the life of the mother.</p>

<p id="fc115ad7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">HARRIS v. M<span class="epub-small-caps">c</span>RAE, 448 U.S. 297 (1980): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc115ad8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents constitutional questions concerning the public funding of abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Medicaid Act,” and recent annual Appropriations Acts containing the so-called “Hyde Amendment.” The constitutional question is whether the Hyde Amendment, by denying public funding for certain medically necessary abortions, contravenes the liberty or equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc115ad9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since September 1976, Congress has prohibited—either by an amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or by a joint resolution—the use of any federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program except under certain specified circumstances. This funding restriction is commonly known as the “Hyde Amendment,” after its original congressional sponsor, Representative Hyde. The current version of the Hyde Amendment, applicable for fiscal year 1980, provides: “[N]one of the funds provided by this joint resolution shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term; or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service.”</p>
<p id="fc115ada-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We address first the appellees’ argument that the Hyde Amendment, by restricting the availability of certain medically necessary abortions under Medicaid, impinges on the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause as recognized in Roe v. Wade, and its progeny. But the Court in <i>Wade</i> also recognized that a State has legitimate interests during a pregnancy in both ensuring the health of the mother and protecting potential human life. These state interests, which were found to be “separate and distinct” and to “gro[w] in substantiality <span title="1004" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1004">p. 1004</span>as the woman approaches term,” pose a conflict with a woman’s untrammeled freedom of choice.</p>
<p id="fc115adb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hyde Amendment, like the Connecticut welfare regulation at issue in <i>Maher</i>, places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but rather, by means of unequal subsidization of abortion and other medical services, encourages alternative activity deemed in the public interest. The present case does differ factually from <i>Maher</i> insofar as that case involved a failure to fund nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the Hyde Amendment withholds funding of certain medically necessary abortions. Accordingly, the appellees argue that because the Hyde Amendment affects a significant interest not present or asserted in <i>Maher</i>—the interest of a woman in protecting her health during pregnancy—and because that interest lies at the core of the personal constitutional freedom recognized in <i>Wade</i>, the present case is constitutionally different from <i>Maher</i>.</p>
<p id="fc115adc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, regardless of whether the freedom of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons lies at the core or the periphery of the due process liberty recognized in <i>Wade</i>, it simply does not follow that a woman’s freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices. The reason why was explained in <i>Maher</i>: although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman’s exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove those not of its own creation. Indigency falls in the latter category. The financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman’s ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency. Although Congress has opted to subsidize medically necessary services generally, but not certain medically necessary abortions, the fact remains that the Hyde Amendment leaves an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all. We are thus not persuaded that the Hyde Amendment impinges on the constitutionally protected freedom of choice recognized in <i>Wade.</i> A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of a “penalty” on that activity.</p>
<p id="fc115add-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause affords protection against unwarranted government interference with freedom of choice in the context of certain personal decisions, it does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom. To hold otherwise would mark a drastic change in our understanding of the Constitution. It cannot be that because government may not prohibit the use of contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, or prevent parents from sending their child to a private school, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, government, therefore, has an affirmative constitutional obligation to ensure that all persons have the financial resources to obtain contraceptives or send their children to private schools. To translate the limitation on governmental power implicit in the Due Process Clause into an affirmative funding obligation would require Congress to subsidize the medically necessary abortion of an indigent woman even if Congress had not enacted a Medicaid program to subsidize other medically necessary services. Nothing in the Due Process Clause supports such an extraordinary result. Whether freedom of choice that is constitutionally protected warrants federal subsidization is a question for Congress to answer, not a matter of constitutional <span title="1005" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1005">p. 1005</span>entitlement. Accordingly, we conclude that the Hyde Amendment does not impinge on the due process liberty recognized in <i>Wade.</i></p>

<p id="fc115ae3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Missouri law] requires the prior written consent of the spouse of the woman seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless “the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.”</p>
<p id="fc1181f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellees defend [the law] on the ground that it was enacted in the light of the General Assembly’s “perception of marriage as an institution,” and that any major change in family status is a decision to be made jointly by the marriage partners. Reference is made to an abortion’s possible effect on the woman’s child bearing potential. It is said that marriage always has entailed some legislatively imposed limitations: Reference is made to adultery and bigamy as criminal offenses; to Missouri’s general requirement that for an adoption of a child born in wedlock the consent of both parents is necessary; to similar joint-consent requirements imposed by a number of States with respect to artificial insemination and the legitimacy of children so conceived; to the laws of two States requiring spousal consent for voluntary sterilization; and to the long-established requirement of spousal consent for the effective disposition of an interest in real property.</p>
<p id="fc1181f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case that the State cannot “delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.” Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, to prevent abortion during that same period.</p>
<p id="fc1181f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife’s pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying. Neither has this Court failed to appreciate the importance of the marital relationship in our society. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forego an abortion may have profound effects on the future of any marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious. Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy, when the State itself lacks that right.</p>
<p id="fc1181f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section does much more than insure that the husband participate in the decision whether his wife should have an abortion. The State, instead, has <span title="1006" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1006">p. 1006</span>determined that the husband’s interest in continuing the pregnancy of his wife always outweighs any interest on her part in terminating it irrespective of the condition of their marriage. The State, accordingly, has granted him the right to prevent unilaterally, and for whatever reason, the effectuation of his wife’s and her physician’s decision to terminate her pregnancy. This state determination not only may discourage the consultation that might normally be expected to precede a major decision affecting the marital couple but also, and more importantly, the State has interposed an absolute obstacle to a woman’s decision that <i>Roe</i> held to be constitutionally protected from such interference.</p>
<p id="fc1181f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband. No marriage may be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue. But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all. Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the “interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship.”</p>
<p id="fc1181f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize, of course, that when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. The obvious fact is that when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor. We conclude that the Missouri Act is inconsistent with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade and is unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fc118202-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3209 of Pennsylvania’s abortion law provides, except in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shall perform an abortion on a married woman <span title="1007" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1007">p. 1007</span>without receiving a signed statement from the woman that she has notified her spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. The woman has the option of providing an alternative signed statement certifying that her husband is not the man who impregnated her; that her husband could not be located; that the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault which she has reported; or that the woman believes that notifying her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodily injury upon her. A physician who performs an abortion on a married woman without receiving the appropriate signed statement will have his or her license revoked, and is liable to the husband for damages.</p>
<p id="fc11a913-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limited research that has been conducted with respect to notifying one’s husband about an abortion, although involving samples too small to be representative, supports the District Court’s findings of fact. The vast majority of women notify their male partners of their decision to obtain an abortion. In many cases in which married women do not notify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an extramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the primary reason women do not notify their husbands is that the husband and wife are experiencing marital difficulties, often accompanied by incidents of violence.</p>
<p id="fc11a914-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These findings are supported by studies of domestic violence. The American Medical Association (AMA) has published a summary of the recent research in this field, which indicates that in an average 12-month period in this country, approximately two million women are the victims of severe assaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, women reported that nearly one of every eight husbands had assaulted their wives during the past year. The AMA views these figures as “marked underestimates,” because the nature of these incidents discourages women from reporting them, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor, those who do not speak English well, and women who are homeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey is conducted. According to the AMA, “[r]esearchers on family violence agree that the true incidence of partner violence is probably <i>double</i> the above estimates; or four million severely assaulted women per year. Studies on prevalence suggest that from one-fifth to one-third of all women will be physically assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their lifetime.” AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, Violence Against Women 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidents involve sexual assault.</p>
<p id="fc11a915-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other studies fill in the rest of this troubling picture. Physical violence is only the most visible form of abuse. Psychological abuse, particularly forced social and economic isolation of women, is also common. Many victims of domestic violence remain with their abusers, perhaps because they perceive no superior alternative. Many abused women who find temporary refuge in shelters return to their husbands, in large part because they have no other source of income. Returning to one’s abuser can be dangerous. Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics disclose that 8.8 percent of all homicide victims in the United States are killed by their spouses. Thirty percent of female homicide victims are killed by their male partners.</p>
<p id="fc11a916-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This information and the District Court’s findings reinforce what common sense would suggest. In well-functioning marriages, spouses discuss important intimate decisions such as whether to bear a child. But there are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological <span title="1008" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1008">p. 1008</span>abuse at the hands of their husbands. Should these women become pregnant, they may have very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Many may have justifiable fears of physical abuse, but may be no less fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a reasonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke further instances of child abuse; these women are not exempt from §3209’s notification requirement. Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands, including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and friends. These methods of psychological abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to notification than the possibility of physical violence, but women who are the victims of the abuse are not exempt from §3209’s notification requirement. And many women who are pregnant as a result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable to avail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault, §3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the woman have notified law enforcement authorities within 90 days of the assault, and her husband will be notified of her report once an investigation begins, §3128(c). If anything in this field is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault are extremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government; hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exempt from the notification requirement imposed by §3209.</p>
<p id="fc11a917-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases.</p>
<p id="fc11a918-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that §3209 is invalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden at all for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. They begin by noting that only about 20 percent of the women who obtain abortions are married. They then note that of these women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of §3209 are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abortions. Respondents argue that since some of these women will be able to notify their husbands without adverse consequences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statute affects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions. For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalid on its face. We disagree with respondents’ basic method of analysis.</p>
<p id="fc11a919-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, we would not say that a law which requires a newspaper to print a candidate’s reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on its face because most newspapers would adopt the policy even absent the law. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="fc11a91a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions upholding parental notification or consent requirements. Those enactments, and our judgment <span title="1009" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1009">p. 1009</span>that they are constitutional, are based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumption about adult women.</p>
<p id="fc11a91b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that a husband has a “deep and proper concern and interest . . . in his wife’s pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.” With regard to the children he has fathered and raised, the Court has recognized his “cognizable and substantial” interest in their custody. If these cases concerned a State’s ability to require the mother to notify the father before taking some action with respect to a living child raised by both, therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude as a general matter that the father’s interest in the welfare of the child and the mother’s interest are equal.</p>
<p id="fc11a91c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before birth, however, the issue takes on a very different cast. It is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have a far greater impact on the mother’s liberty than on the father’s. The effect of state regulation on a woman’s protected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case, as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere of the family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant woman. The Court has held that “when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.” This conclusion rests upon the basic nature of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: “[T]he marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.” Eisenstadt v. Baird. The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike, from unjustified state interference, even when that interference is enacted into law for the benefit of their spouses.</p>
<p id="fc11a91d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was a time, not so long ago, when a different understanding of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. In keeping with our rejection of the common-law understanding of a woman’s role within the family, the Court held in <i>Danforth</i> that the Constitution does not permit a State to require a married woman to obtain her husband’s consent before undergoing an abortion. The principles that guided the Court in <i>Danforth</i> should be our guides today. For the great many women who are victims of abuse inflicted by their husbands, or whose children are the victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife’s decision. Whether the prospect of notification itself deters such women from seeking abortions, or whether the husband, through physical force or psychological pressure or economic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abortion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often be tantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in <i>Danforth.</i> The women most affected by this law—those who most reasonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbands that they are pregnant—are in the gravest danger.</p>
<p id="fc11a91e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The husband’s interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him with this troubling degree of authority over <span title="1010" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1010">p. 1010</span>his wife. The contrary view leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law. A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a husband’s interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a wife’s liberty, the State could require a married woman to notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiring pregnant married women to notify their husbands before engaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all, if the husband’s interest in the fetus’ safety is a sufficient predicate for state regulation, the State could reasonably conclude that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before drinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married women should notify their husbands before using contraceptives or before undergoing any type of surgery that may have complications affecting the husband’s interest in his wife’s reproductive organs. And if a husband’s interest justifies notice in any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that it justifies exactly what the <i>Danforth</i> Court held it did not justify—a requirement of the husband’s consent as well. A State may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children.</p>
<p id="fc11a91f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant to our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual’s family. These considerations confirm our conclusion that §3209 is invalid.</p>
<p id="fc11a920-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White,</span> Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="fc11a921-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State itself has legitimate interests both in protecting these interests of the father and in protecting the potential life of the fetus, and the spousal notification requirement is reasonably related to advancing those state interests. By providing that a husband will usually know of his spouse’s intent to have an abortion, the provision makes it more likely that the husband will participate in deciding the fate of his unborn child, a possibility that might otherwise have been denied him. This participation might in some cases result in a decision to proceed with the pregnancy. As Judge Alito observed in his dissent below, “[t]he Pennsylvania legislature could have rationally believed that some married women are initially inclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands’ knowledge because of perceived problems—such as economic constraints, future plans, or the husbands’ previously expressed opposition—that may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion.”</p>
<p id="fc11d032-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State also has a legitimate interest in promoting “the integrity of the marital relationship.” This Court has previously recognized “the importance of the marital relationship in our society.” In our view, the spousal notice requirement is a rational attempt by the State to improve truthful communication between spouses and encourage collaborative decisionmaking, and thereby fosters marital integrity.</p>
<p id="fc11d033-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners argue that the notification requirement does not further any such interest; they assert that the majority of wives already notify their husbands of their abortion decisions, and the remainder have excellent reasons for keeping their decisions a secret. In the first case, they argue, the law is unnecessary, <span title="1011" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1011">p. 1011</span>and in the second case it will only serve to foster marital discord and threats of harm. Thus, petitioners see the law as a totally irrational means of furthering whatever legitimate interest the State might have. But, in our view, it is unrealistic to assume that every husband-wife relationship is either (1) so perfect that this type of truthful and important communication will take place as a matter of course, or (2) so imperfect that, upon notice, the husband will react selfishly, violently, or contrary to the best interests of his wife.</p>
<p id="fc11d034-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The spousal notice provision will admittedly be unnecessary in some circumstances, and possibly harmful in others, but “the existence of particular cases in which a feature of a statute performs no function (or is even counterproductive) ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitutional or even constitutionally suspect.” The Pennsylvania Legislature was in a position to weigh the likely benefits of the provision against its likely adverse effects, and presumably concluded, on balance, that the provision would be beneficial. Whether this was a wise decision or not, we cannot say that it was irrational. We therefore conclude that the spousal notice provision comports with the Constitution.</p>

<p id="fc11d03e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These appeals present a challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute regulating the access of minors to abortions.</p>
<p id="fc11d03f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Massachusetts law] provides in part: “If the mother is less than eighteen years of age and has not married, the consent of both the mother and her parents [to an abortion to be performed on the mother] is required. If one or both of the mother’s parents refuse such consent, consent may be obtained by order of a judge of the superior court for good cause shown, after such hearing as he deems necessary. Such a hearing will not require the appointment of a guardian for the mother. If one of the parents has died or has deserted his or her family, consent by the remaining parent is sufficient. If both parents have died or have deserted their family, consent of the mother’s guardian or other person having duties similar to a guardian, or any person who had assumed the care and custody of the mother is sufficient.” Physicians performing abortions in the absence of the consent required by §12S are subject to injunctions and criminal penalties.</p>
<p id="fc11d040-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A child, merely on account of his minority, is not beyond the protection of the Constitution. As the Court said in In re Gault (1967), “whatever may be their <span title="1012" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1012">p. 1012</span>precise impact, neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone.” This observation, of course, is but the beginning of the analysis. The Court long has recognized that the status of minors under the law is unique in many respects.</p>
<p id="fc11f751-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unique role in our society of the family, the institution by which “we inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values, moral and cultural,” Moore v. East Cleveland (1977), requires that constitutional principles be applied with sensitivity and flexibility to the special needs of parents and children. We have recognized three reasons justifying the conclusion that the constitutional rights of children cannot be equated with those of adults: the peculiar vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner; and the importance of the parental role in child rearing.</p>
<p id="fc11f752-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unquestionably, there are many competing theories about the most effective way for parents to fulfill their central role in assisting their children on the way to responsible adulthood. While we do not pretend any special wisdom on this subject, we cannot ignore that central to many of these theories, and deeply rooted in our Nation’s history and tradition, is the belief that the parental role implies a substantial measure of authority over one’s children. Indeed, “constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents’ claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic in the structure of our society.”</p>
<p id="fc11f753-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles in mind, we consider the specific constitutional questions presented by these appeals. In §12S, Massachusetts has attempted to reconcile the constitutional right of a woman, in consultation with her physician, to choose to terminate her pregnancy as established by Roe v. Wade (1973), with the special interest of the State in encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the advice of her parents in making the important decision whether or not to bear a child.</p>
<p id="fc11f754-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We previously had held in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth (1976) that a State could not lawfully authorize an absolute parental veto over the decision of a minor to terminate her pregnancy. Appellees and intervenors contend that even as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, §12S does unduly burden this right. They suggest, for example, that the mere requirement of parental notice constitutes such a burden. [H]owever, parental notice and consent are qualifications that typically may be imposed by the State on a minor’s right to make important decisions. As immature minors often lack the ability to make fully informed choices that take account of both immediate and long-range consequences, a State reasonably may determine that parental consultation often is desirable and in the best interest of the minor. It may further determine, as a general proposition, that such consultation is particularly desirable with respect to the abortion decision—one that for some people raises profound moral and religious concerns.</p>
<p id="fc11f755-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Roe v. Wade, we emphasized the importance of the role of the attending physician. Those cases involved adult women presumably capable of selecting and obtaining a competent physician. In this case, however, we are concerned only with minors who, according to the record, may range in age from children of 12 years to 17-year-old teenagers. Even the latter are less likely than adults to know or be able to recognize ethical, qualified physicians, or to have the means <span title="1013" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1013">p. 1013</span>to engage such professionals. Many minors who bypass their parents probably will resort to an abortion clinic, without being able to distinguish the competent and ethical from those that are incompetent or unethical.</p>
<p id="fc11f756-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we are concerned here with a constitutional right to seek an abortion. The abortion decision differs in important ways from other decisions that may be made during minority. The need to preserve the constitutional right and the unique nature of the abortion decision, especially when made by a minor, require a State to act with particular sensitivity when it legislates to foster parental involvement in this matter.</p>
<p id="fc11f757-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pregnant minor’s options are much different from those facing a minor in other situations, such as deciding whether to marry. A minor not permitted to marry before the age of majority is required simply to postpone her decision. She and her intended spouse may preserve the opportunity for later marriage should they continue to desire it. A pregnant adolescent, however, cannot preserve for long the possibility of aborting, which effectively expires in a matter of weeks from the onset of pregnancy.</p>
<p id="fc11f758-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the potentially severe detriment facing a pregnant woman is not mitigated by her minority. Indeed, considering her probable education, employment skills, financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor. In addition, the fact of having a child brings with it adult legal responsibility, for parenthood, like attainment of the age of majority, is one of the traditional criteria for the termination of the legal disabilities of minority. In sum, there are few situations in which denying a minor the right to make an important decision will have consequences so grave and indelible.</p>
<p id="fc11f759-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet, an abortion may not be the best choice for the minor. The circumstances in which this issue arises will vary widely. In a given case, alternatives to abortion, such as marriage to the father of the child, arranging for its adoption, or assuming the responsibilities of motherhood with the assured support of family, may be feasible and relevant to the minor’s best interests. Nonetheless, the abortion decision is one that simply cannot be postponed, or it will be made by default with far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p id="fc11f75a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, as we held in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, “the State may not impose a blanket provision . . . requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy.” Although such deference to parents may be permissible with respect to other choices facing a minor, the unique nature and consequences of the abortion decision make it inappropriate “to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient’s pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.” We therefore conclude that if the State decides to require a pregnant minor to obtain one or both parents’ consent to an abortion, it also must provide an alternative procedure whereby authorization for the abortion can be obtained.</p>
<p id="fc11f75b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A pregnant minor is entitled in such a proceeding to show either: (1) that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision, in consultation with her physician, independently of her parents’ wishes; or (2) that even if she is not able to make this decision independently, the desired abortion would be in her best interests. The proceeding in which this showing is made must assure that a resolution of the issue, and any appeals that may follow, <span title="1014" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1014">p. 1014</span>will be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained. In sum, the procedure must ensure that the provision requiring parental consent does not in fact amount to the “absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto” that was found impermissible in <i>Danforth.</i></p>
<p id="fc11f75c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, therefore, that under state regulation such as that undertaken by Massachusetts, every minor must have the opportunity—if she so desires—to go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents. If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the court must authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this decision independently, she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the court must authorize the abortion. If, however, the court is not persuaded by the minor that she is mature or that the abortion would be in her best interests, it may decline to sanction the operation.</p>
<p id="fc11f75d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall,</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> join, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc11f75e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Massachusetts requires the consent of both of the woman’s parents. It does, of course, provide an alternative in the form of a suit initiated by the woman in superior court. But in that proceeding, the judge is afforded an absolute veto over the minor’s decisions, based on his judgment of her best interests. In Massachusetts, then, the State has imposed an “absolute limitation on the minor’s right to obtain an abortion,” applicable to every pregnant minor in the State who has not married.</p>
<p id="fc121e6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provision of an absolute veto to a judge—or, potentially, to an appointed administrator—is to me particularly troubling. The constitutional right to make the abortion decision affords protection to both of the privacy interests recognized in this Court’s cases: “One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.” It is inherent in the right to make the abortion decision that the right may be exercised without public scrutiny and in defiance of the contrary opinion of the sovereign or other third parties. In Massachusetts, however, every minor who cannot secure the consent of both her parents—which under <i>Danforth</i> cannot be an absolute prerequisite to an abortion—is required to secure the consent of the sovereign. As a practical matter, I would suppose that the need to commence judicial proceedings in order to obtain a legal abortion would impose a burden at least as great as, and probably greater than, that imposed on the minor child by the need to obtain the consent of a parent. Moreover, once this burden is met, the only standard provided for the judge’s decision is the best interest of the minor. That standard provides little real guidance to the judge, and his decision must necessarily reflect personal and societal values and mores whose enforcement upon the minor—particularly when contrary to her own informed and reasonable decision—is fundamentally at odds with privacy interests underlying the constitutional protection afforded to her decision.</p>

Matheson, 450 U.S. 398 (1981), the Supreme Court upheld a Utah law that required that a physician “[n]otify, if possible, the parents or guardian of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be performed, if she is a minor.” The Court said that although “a state may not constitutionally legislate a blanket, unreviewable veto power of parents to veto their daughter’s abortion, a statute setting out a ‘mere requirement of parental notice’ does not violate the constitutional rights of an immature, dependent minor.” The Court emphasized that parents have a constitutional right to raise their children and that therefore the state has an important interest in making sure that parents are notified prior to an abortion on a teenage girl. The Court also stressed that the “Utah statute gives neither parents nor the judges a veto power over the minor’s abortion decision.” The Court said that the fact that the notice requirement might “inhibit some minors from seeking abortions is not a valid basis to void the statute.”</p>
<p id="fc121e71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, the Supreme Court upheld parental notification requirements as long as they have the judicial bypass procedures outlined in <i>Bellotti.</i> In Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U.S. 502 (1990), the Court upheld a law that required that notice be given to at least one parent of an unmarried minor before an abortion could be performed. The law allowed an abortion without such notification if a judge approved it either by finding it would be in the minor’s best interests or by concluding that she is mature enough to decide for herself.</p>
<p id="fc121e72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417 (1990), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an even more burdensome law that required that notice be given to both of a minor’s parents before an abortion could be performed. The Court specifically ruled that a two-parent notification requirement without a judicial bypass procedure was unconstitutional but that such a requirement is permissible as long as there is a mechanism for judicial bypass.</p>

The Court allowed the law because of the government’s compelling interest in stopping the spread of communicable diseases.</p>

Copetitioners Lester and Joyce Cruzan, Nancy’s parents and coguardians, sought a court order directing the withdrawal of their daughter’s artificial feeding and hydration equipment after it became apparent that she had virtually no chance of recovering her cognitive faculties. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that because there was no clear and convincing evidence of Nancy’s desire to have life-sustaining treatment withdrawn under such circumstances, her parents lacked authority to effectuate such a request. We granted certiorari, and now affirm.</p>
<p id="fc124592-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the night of January 11, 1983, Nancy Cruzan lost control of her car as she traveled down Elm Road in Jasper County, Missouri. The vehicle overturned, and Cruzan was discovered lying face down in a ditch without detectable respiratory or cardiac function. Paramedics were able to restore her breathing and heartbeat at the accident site, and she was transported to a hospital in an unconscious state. An attending neurosurgeon diagnosed her as having sustained probable cerebral contusions compounded by significant anoxia (lack of oxygen). The Missouri trial court in this case found that permanent brain damage generally results after 6 minutes in an anoxic state; it was estimated that Cruzan was deprived of oxygen from 12 to 14 minutes. She remained in a coma for approximately three weeks and then progressed to an unconscious state in which she was able to orally ingest some nutrition. In order to ease feeding and further the recovery, surgeons implanted a gastrostomy feeding and hydration tube in Cruzan with the consent of her then husband. Subsequent rehabilitative efforts proved unavailing. She now lies in a Missouri state hospital in what is commonly referred to as a persistent vegetative state: generally, a condition in which a person exhibits motor reflexes but evinces no indications of significant cognitive function. The State of Missouri is bearing the cost of her care.</p>
<p id="fc124593-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After it had become apparent that Nancy Cruzan had virtually no chance of regaining her mental faculties, her parents asked hospital employees to terminate the artificial nutrition and hydration procedures. All agree that such a removal would cause her death. The employees refused to honor the request without court approval. The parents then sought and received authorization <span title="1017" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1017">p. 1017</span>from the state trial court for termination. The court found that a person in Nancy’s condition had a fundamental right under the State and Federal Constitutions to refuse or direct the withdrawal of “death prolonging procedures.” The court also found that Nancy’s “expressed thoughts at age twenty-five in somewhat serious conversation with a housemate friend that if sick or injured she would not wish to continue her life unless she could live at least halfway normally suggests that given her present condition she would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration.” The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed by a divided vote.</p>
<p id="fc124594-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari to consider the question whether Cruzan has a right under the United States Constitution which would require the hospital to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from her under these circumstances.</p>
<p id="fc124595-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, even the touching of one person by another without consent and without legal justification was a battery. This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment. The informed consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law. The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent, that is, to refuse treatment.</p>
<p id="fc124596-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), for instance, the Court balanced an individual’s liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine against the State’s interest in preventing disease. Just this Term, in the course of holding that a State’s procedures for administering antipsychotic medication to prisoners were sufficient to satisfy due process concerns, we recognized that prisoners possess “a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Washington v. Harper (1990).</p>
<p id="fc124597-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But determining that a person has a “liberty interest” under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry; “whether respondent’s constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests against the relevant state interests.” Petitioners insist that under the general holdings of our cases, the forced administration of life-sustaining medical treatment, and even of artificially delivered food and water essential to life, would implicate a competent person’s liberty interest. Although we think the logic of the cases discussed above would embrace such a liberty interest, the dramatic consequences involved in refusal of such treatment would inform the inquiry as to whether the deprivation of that interest is constitutionally permissible. But for purposes of this case, we assume that the United States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition.</p>
<p id="fc124598-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners insist that under the general holdings of our cases, the forced administration of life-sustaining medical treatment, and even of artificially delivered food and water essential to life, would implicate a competent person’s liberty interest. The difficulty with petitioners’ claim is that in a sense it begs the question: An incompetent person is not able to make an informed and voluntary choice to exercise a hypothetical right to refuse treatment or any other right. Such a “right” must be exercised for her, if at all, by some sort of surrogate. Here, Missouri has in effect recognized that under certain circumstances <span title="1018" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1018">p. 1018</span>a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death, but it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the action of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent. Missouri requires that evidence of the incompetent’s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The question, then, is whether the United States Constitution forbids the establishment of this procedural requirement by the State. We hold that it does not.</p>
<p id="fc124599-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not Missouri’s clear and convincing evidence requirement comports with the United States Constitution depends in part on what interests the State may properly seek to protect in this situation. Missouri relies on its interest in the protection and preservation of human life, and there can be no gainsaying this interest. As a general matter, the States—indeed, all civilized nations—demonstrate their commitment to life by treating homicide as a serious crime. Moreover, the majority of States in this country have laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide. We do not think a State is required to remain neutral in the face of an informed and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death.</p>
<p id="fc12459a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in the context presented here, a State has more particular interests at stake. The choice between life and death is a deeply personal decision of obvious and overwhelming finality. We believe Missouri may legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of this choice through the imposition of heightened evidentiary requirements. It cannot be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an interest in life as well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining medical treatment. Not all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate decision-makers. And even where family members are present, “[t]here will, of course, be some unfortunate situations in which family members will not act to protect a patient.” A State is entitled to guard against potential abuses in such situations. Similarly, a State is entitled to consider that a judicial proceeding to make a determination regarding an incompetent’s wishes may very well not be an adversarial one, with the added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings with it. Finally, we think a State may properly decline to make judgments about the “quality” of life that a particular individual may enjoy.</p>
<p id="fc12459b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, Missouri has <span title="1019" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1019">p. 1019</span>permissibly sought to advance these interests through the adoption of a “clear and convincing” standard of proof to govern such proceedings. “This Court has mandated an intermediate standard of proof—‘clear and convincing evidence’—when the individual interests at stake in a state proceeding are both ‘particularly important’ and ‘more substantial than mere loss of money.’” Santosky v. Kramer (1982). Thus, such a standard has been required in deportation proceedings, in denaturalization proceedings, in civil commitment proceedings, and in proceedings for the termination of parental rights.</p>
<p id="fc12459c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it self-evident that the interests at stake in the instant proceedings are more substantial, both on an individual and societal level, than those involved in a run-of-the-mill civil dispute. But not only does the standard of proof reflect the importance of a particular adjudication, it also serves as “a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the litigants.” The more stringent the burden of proof a party must bear, the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision. We believe that Missouri may permissibly place an increased risk of an erroneous decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual’s life-sustaining treatment. An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent developments such as advancements in medical science, the discovery of new evidence regarding the patient’s intent, changes in the law, or simply the unexpected death of the patient despite the administration of life-sustaining treatment at least create the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its impact mitigated. An erroneous decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, however, is not susceptible of correction.</p>
<p id="fc12459d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we conclude that a State may apply a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state.</p>
<p id="fc126cae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Missouri held that in this case the testimony adduced at trial did not amount to clear and convincing proof of the patient’s desire to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn. In so doing, it reversed a decision of the Missouri trial court which had found that the evidence “suggest[ed]” Nancy Cruzan would not have desired to continue such measures, but which had not adopted the standard of “clear and convincing evidence” enunciated by the Supreme Court. The testimony adduced at trial consisted primarily of Nancy Cruzan’s statements made to a housemate about a year before her accident that she would not want to live should she face life as a “vegetable,” and other observations to the same effect. The observations did not deal in terms with withdrawal of medical treatment or of hydration and nutrition. We cannot say that the Supreme Court of Missouri committed constitutional error in reaching the conclusion that it did.</p>
<p id="fc126caf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners alternatively contend that Missouri must accept the “substituted judgment” of close family members even in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the views of the patient. No doubt is engendered by anything in this record but that Nancy Cruzan’s mother and father are loving and caring parents. If the State were required by the United States Constitution to repose a right of “substituted judgment” with anyone, the Cruzans would surely qualify. But we do not think the Due Process Clause requires the State to repose judgment on these matters with anyone but the patient herself. Close family members may have a strong feeling—a feeling not at all ignoble or unworthy, but not entirely disinterested, either—that they do not wish to witness the continuation of the life of a loved one which they regard as hopeless, meaningless, and even degrading. But there is no automatic assurance that the view of close family members will necessarily be the same as the patient’s would have been had she been confronted with the prospect of her situation while competent. All of the reasons previously discussed for allowing Missouri to require clear and convincing evidence of the patient’s wishes lead us to conclude that the State may choose to defer only to those wishes, rather than confide the decision to close family members.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1150A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1150A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span></p>

<p id="fc126cb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1020" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1020">p. 1020</span>I agree that a protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions, and that the refusal of artificially delivered food and water is encompassed within that liberty interest. I write separately to clarify why I believe this to be so.</p>
<p id="fc126cb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Court notes, the liberty interest in refusing medical treatment flows from decisions involving the State’s invasions into the body. Because our notions of liberty are inextricably entwined with our idea of physical freedom and self-determination, the Court has often deemed state incursions into the body repugnant to the interests protected by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Rochin v. California (1952) (“Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his stomach’s contents . . . is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities”). Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has echoed this same concern. See Schmerber v. California (1966) (“The integrity of an individual’s person is a cherished value of our society”); Winston v. Lee (1985) (“A compelled surgical intrusion into an individual’s body for evidence . . . implicates expectations of privacy and security of such magnitude that the intrusion may be ‘unreasonable’ even if likely to produce evidence of a crime”). The State’s imposition of medical treatment on an unwilling competent adult necessarily involves some form of restraint and intrusion. A seriously ill or dying patient whose wishes are not honored may feel a captive of the machinery required for life-sustaining measures or other medical interventions. Such forced treatment may burden that individual’s liberty interests as much as any state coercion.</p>
<p id="fc126cb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s artificial provision of nutrition and hydration implicates identical concerns. Artificial feeding cannot readily be distinguished from other forms of medical treatment. Whether or not the techniques used to pass food and water into the patient’s alimentary tract are termed “medical treatment,” it is clear they all involve some degree of intrusion and restraint. Feeding a patient by means of a nasogastric tube requires a physician to pass a long flexible tube through the patient’s nose, throat, and esophagus and into the stomach. Because of the discomfort such a tube causes, “[m]any patients need to be restrained forcibly and their hands put into large mittens to prevent them from removing the tube.” A gastrostomy tube (as was used to provide food and water to Nancy Cruzan) must be surgically implanted into the stomach or small intestine. Requiring a competent adult to endure such procedures against her will burdens the patient’s liberty, dignity, and freedom to determine the course of her own treatment. Accordingly, the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause must protect, if it protects anything, an individual’s deeply personal decision to reject medical treatment, including the artificial delivery of food and water.</p>
<p id="fc126cb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I also write separately to emphasize that the Court does not today decide the issue whether a State must also give effect to the decisions of a surrogate decisionmaker. In my view, such a duty may well be constitutionally required to protect the patient’s liberty interest in refusing medical treatment. Few individuals provide explicit oral or written instructions regarding their intent to refuse medical treatment should they become incompetent. States which decline to consider any evidence other than such instructions may frequently fail to honor a patient’s intent. Such failures might be avoided if the State considered an equally probative source of evidence: the patient’s appointment of a proxy to make health care decisions on her behalf. Delegating the authority to make <span title="1021" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1021">p. 1021</span>medical decisions to a family member or friend is becoming a common method of planning for the future. Several States have recognized the practical wisdom of such a procedure by enacting durable power of attorney statutes that specifically authorize an individual to appoint a surrogate to make medical treatment decisions. Some state courts have suggested that an agent appointed pursuant to a general durable power of attorney statute would also be empowered to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient. Other States allow an individual to designate a proxy to carry out the intent of a living will. These procedures for surrogate decisionmaking, which appear to be rapidly gaining in acceptance, may be a valuable additional safeguard of the patient’s interest in directing his medical care. Moreover, as patients are likely to select a family member as a surrogate, giving effect to a proxy’s decisions may also protect the “freedom of personal choice in matters of . . . family life.”</p>
<p id="fc126cb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision, holding only that the Constitution permits a State to require clear and convincing evidence of Nancy Cruzan’s desire to have artificial hydration and nutrition withdrawn, does not preclude a future determination that the Constitution requires the States to implement the decisions of a patient’s duly appointed surrogate. Nor does it prevent States from developing other approaches for protecting an incompetent individual’s liberty interest in refusing medical treatment. As is evident from the Court’s survey of state court decisions, no national consensus has yet emerged on the best solution for this difficult and sensitive problem. Today we decide only that one State’s practice does not violate the Constitution; the more challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding incompetents’ liberty interests is entrusted to the “laboratory” of the States in the first instance.</p>
<p id="fc126cb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> concurring.</p>
<p id="fc126cb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While I agree with the Court’s analysis today, and therefore join in its opinion, I would have preferred that we announce, clearly and promptly, that the federal courts have no business in this field; that American law has always accorded the State the power to prevent, by force if necessary, suicide—including suicide by refusing to take appropriate measures necessary to preserve one’s life; that the point at which life becomes “worthless,” and the point at which the means necessary to preserve it become “extraordinary” or “inappropriate,” are neither set forth in the Constitution nor known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory; and hence, that even when it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that a patient no longer wishes certain measures to be taken to preserve his or her life, it is up to the citizens of Missouri to decide, through their elected representatives, whether that wish will be honored. It is quite impossible (because the Constitution says nothing about the matter) that those citizens will decide upon a line less lawful than the one we would choose; and it is unlikely (because we know no more about “life and death” than they do) that they will decide upon a line less reasonable.</p>

<p id="fc126cba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”Medical technology has effectively created a twilight zone of suspended animation where death commences while life, in some form, continues.

<p id="fc126cbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nancy Cruzan has dwelt in that twilight zone for six years. She is oblivious to her surroundings and will remain so. Her body twitches only reflexively, without consciousness. The areas of her brain that once thought, felt, and experienced sensations have degenerated badly and are continuing to do so. The “‘cerebral cortical atrophy is irreversible, permanent, progressive and ongoing.’” “Nancy will never interact meaningfully with her environment again. She will remain in a persistent vegetative state until her death.” Because she cannot swallow, her nutrition and hydration are delivered through a tube surgically implanted in her stomach.</p>
<p id="fc126cbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A grown woman at the time of the accident, Nancy had previously expressed her wish to forgo continuing medical care under circumstances such as these. Her family and her friends are convinced that this is what she would want. A guardian ad litem appointed by the trial court is also convinced that this is what Nancy would want. Yet the Missouri Supreme Court, alone among state courts deciding such a question, has determined that an irreversibly vegetative patient will remain a passive prisoner of medical technology—for Nancy, perhaps for the next 30 years.</p>
<p id="fc1293cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court, while tentatively accepting that there is some degree of constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding unwanted medical treatment, including life-sustaining medical treatment such as artificial nutrition and hydration, affirms the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court. The majority opinion, as I read it, would affirm that decision on the ground that a State may require “clear and convincing” evidence of Nancy Cruzan’s prior decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment under circumstances such as hers in order to ensure that her actual wishes are honored. Because I believe that Nancy Cruzan has a fundamental right to be free of unwanted artificial nutrition and hydration, which right is not outweighed by any interests of the State, and because I find that the improperly biased procedural obstacles imposed by the Missouri Supreme Court impermissibly burden that right, I respectfully dissent. Nancy Cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity.</p>
<p id="fc1293ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the right to be free of unwanted medical intervention, like other constitutionally protected interests, may not be absolute, no state interest could outweigh the rights of an individual in Nancy Cruzan’s position. Whatever a State’s possible interests in mandating life-support treatment under other circumstances, there is no good to be obtained here by Missouri’s insistence that Nancy Cruzan remain on life-support systems if it is indeed her wish not to do so. Missouri does not claim, nor could it, that society as a whole will be benefited by Nancy’s receiving medical treatment. No third party’s situation will be improved and no harm to others will be averted.</p>
<p id="fc1293cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only state interest asserted here is a general interest in the preservation of life. But the State has no legitimate general interest in someone’s life, completely abstracted from the interest of the person living that life, that could outweigh the person’s choice to avoid medical treatment. Thus, the State’s general interest in life must accede to Nancy Cruzan’s particularized and intense interest in self-determination in her choice of medical treatment. There is simply nothing legitimately within the State’s purview to be gained by superseding her decision.</p>
<p id="fc1293d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Cruzan</i> leaves many questions unanswered about the <span title="1023" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1023">p. 1023</span>right to refuse treatment. Chief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion assumes that there is a right to refuse treatment, and five justices—Justice O’Connor and the four dissenters—expressly recognize this right. Yet the Court never indicates the level of scrutiny to be used for this liberty interest. Also, the Court approves a state’s requiring clear and convincing evidence that a person wanted treatment terminated before it is ended. But the Court does not consider whether a state may go even further in protecting life and require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Nor does the Court indicate what type of evidence, such as living wills, might be sufficient to meet this proof requirement.</p>

<p id="fc1293dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners in this case are the State of Washington and its Attorney General. Respondents Harold Glucksberg, M.D., Abigail Halperin, M.D., Thomas A. Preston, M.D., and Peter Shalit, M.D., are physicians who practice in Washington. These doctors occasionally treat terminally ill, suffering patients, and declare that they would assist these patients in ending their lives if not for Washington’s assisted-suicide ban. In January 1994, respondents, along with three gravely ill, pseudonymous plaintiffs who have since died and Compassion in Dying, a nonprofit organization that counsels people considering physician-assisted suicide, sued in the United States District Court, seeking a declaration that the Washington law is, on its face, unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fc1293dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs asserted “the existence of a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment which extends to a personal choice by a mentally competent, terminally ill adult to commit physician-assisted suicide.” We begin, as we do in all due process cases, by examining our Nation’s history, legal traditions, and practices. In almost every State—indeed, in almost every western democracy—it is a crime to assist a suicide. The States’ assisted-suicide bans are not innovations. Rather, they are longstanding expressions of the States’ commitment to the protection and preservation of all human life. Indeed, opposition to and condemnation of suicide—and, therefore, of assisting suicide—are consistent and enduring themes of our philosophical, legal, and cultural heritages. <span title="1024" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1024">p. 1024</span>That suicide remained a grievous, though nonfelonious, wrong is confirmed by the fact that colonial and early state legislatures and courts did not retreat from prohibiting assisting suicide.</p>
<p id="fc1293de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though deeply rooted, the States’ assisted-suicide bans have in recent years been reexamined and, generally, reaffirmed. Because of advances in medicine and technology, Americans today are increasingly likely to die in institutions, from chronic illnesses. Public concern and democratic action are therefore sharply focused on how best to protect dignity and independence at the end of life, with the result that there have been many significant changes in state laws and in the attitudes these laws reflect. Many States, for example, now permit “living wills,” surrogate health-care decisionmaking, and the withdrawal or refusal of life-sustaining medical treatment. At the same time, however, voters and legislators continue for the most part to reaffirm their States’ prohibitions on assisting suicide.</p>
<p id="fc12baef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e “ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore “exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,” lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court.</p>
<p id="fc12baf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our established method of substantive-due-process analysis has two primary features: First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.” Second, we have required in substantive-due-process cases a “careful description” of the asserted fundamental liberty interest. Our Nation’s history, legal traditions, and practices thus provide the crucial “guideposts for responsible decisionmaking,” that direct and restrain our exposition of the Due Process Clause. We now inquire whether this asserted right has any place in our Nation’s traditions. Here, we are confronted with a consistent and almost universal tradition that has long rejected the asserted right, and continues explicitly to reject it today, even for terminally ill, mentally competent adults. To hold for respondents, we would have to reverse centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and strike down the considered policy choice of almost every State.</p>
<p id="fc12baf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents contend that in <i>Cruzan</i> we “acknowledged that competent, dying persons have the right to direct the removal of life-sustaining medical treatment and thus hasten death,” and that “the constitutional principle behind recognizing the patient’s liberty to direct the withdrawal of artificial life support applies at least as strongly to the choice to hasten impending death by consuming lethal medication.” The right assumed in <i>Cruzan</i>, however, was not simply deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy. Given the common-law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition protecting the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment, our assumption was entirely consistent with this Nation’s history and constitutional traditions. The decision to commit suicide with the assistance of another may be just as personal and profound as the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment, but it has never enjoyed similar legal protection. Indeed, the two acts are widely and reasonably regarded as quite distinct.</p>
<p id="fc12baf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1025" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1025">p. 1025</span>The history of the law’s treatment of assisted suicide in this country has been and continues to be one of the rejection of nearly all efforts to permit it. That being the case, our decisions lead us to conclude that the asserted “right” to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc12baf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution also requires, however, that Washington’s assisted-suicide ban be rationally related to legitimate government interests. This requirement is unquestionably met here. As the court below recognized, Washington’s assisted-suicide ban implicates a number of state interests.</p>
<p id="fc12baf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, Washington has an “unqualified interest in the preservation of human life.” The State’s prohibition on assisted suicide, like all homicide laws, both reflects and advances its commitment to this interest. Those who attempt suicide—terminally ill or not—often suffer from depression or other mental disorders. See New York Task Force (more than 95% of those who commit suicide had a major psychiatric illness at the time of death; among the terminally ill, uncontrolled pain is a “risk factor” because it contributes to depression). Research indicates, however, that many people who request physician-assisted suicide withdraw that request if their depression and pain are treated. The State also has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession. And physician-assisted suicide could, it is argued, undermine the trust that is essential to the doctor-patient relationship by blurring the time-honored line between healing and harming.</p>
<p id="fc12baf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, the State has an interest in protecting vulnerable groups—including the poor, the elderly, and disabled persons—from abuse, neglect, and mistakes. If physician-assisted suicide were permitted, many might resort to it to spare their families the substantial financial burden of end-of-life health-care costs. The State’s interest here goes beyond protecting the vulnerable from coercion; it extends to protecting disabled and terminally ill people from prejudice, negative and inaccurate stereotypes, and “societal indifference.”</p>
<p id="fc12baf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the State may fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia. Thus, it turns out that what is couched as a limited right to “physician-assisted suicide” is likely, in effect, a much broader license, which could prove extremely difficult to police and contain. Washington’s ban on assisting suicide prevents such erosion.</p>
<p id="fc12baf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This concern is further supported by evidence about the practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands. The Dutch government’s own study revealed that in 1990, there were 2,300 cases of voluntary euthanasia (defined as “the deliberate termination of another’s life at his request”), 400 cases of assisted suicide, and more than 1,000 cases of euthanasia without an explicit request. In addition to these latter 1,000 cases, the study found an additional 4,941 cases where physicians administered lethal morphine overdoses without the patients’ explicit consent. This study suggests that, despite the existence of various reporting procedures, euthanasia in the Netherlands has not been limited to competent, terminally ill adults who are enduring physical suffering, and that regulation of the practice may not have prevented abuses in cases involving vulnerable persons, including severely disabled neonates and elderly persons suffering from dementia. The New York Task Force, citing the Dutch experience, observed that “assisted suicide and euthanasia are closely linked,” and concluded that the “risk of . . . abuse is neither speculative nor distant.” Washington, like most other States, reasonably ensures against this risk by banning, rather than regulating, assisting suicide.</p>
<p id="fc12baf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1026" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1026">p. 1026</span>We need not weigh exactingly the relative strengths of these various interests. They are unquestionably important and legitimate, and Washington’s ban on assisted suicide is at least reasonably related to their promotion and protection. Throughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide. Our holding permits this debate to continue, as it should in a democratic society.</p>
<p id="fc12baf9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor,</span> concurring.

<p id="fc12bafa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Death will be different for each of us. For many, the last days will be spent in physical pain and perhaps the despair that accompanies physical deterioration and a loss of control of basic bodily and mental functions. Some will seek medication to alleviate that pain and other symptoms.</p>
<p id="fc12bafb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court frames the issue in Washington v. Glucksberg as whether the Due Process Clause of the Constitution protects a “right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so,” and concludes that our Nation’s history, legal traditions, and practices do not support the existence of such a right. I join the Court’s opinions because I agree that there is no generalized right to “commit suicide.” But respondents urge us to address the narrower question whether a mentally competent person who is experiencing great suffering has a constitutionally cognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his or her imminent death. I see no need to reach that question in the context of the facial challenges to the New York and Washington laws at issue here.</p>
<p id="fc12bafc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and amici agree that in these States a patient who is suffering from a terminal illness and who is experiencing great pain has no legal barriers to obtaining medication, from qualified physicians, to alleviate that suffering, even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death. In this light, even assuming that we would recognize such an interest, I agree that the State’s interests in protecting those who are not truly competent or facing imminent death, or those whose decisions to hasten death would not truly be voluntary, are sufficiently weighty to justify a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide.</p>
<p id="fc12bafd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every one of us at some point may be affected by our own or a family member’s terminal illness. There is no reason to think the democratic process will not strike the proper balance between the interests of terminally ill, mentally competent individuals who would seek to end their suffering and the State’s interests in protecting those who might seek to end life mistakenly or under pressure. As the Court recognizes, States are presently undertaking extensive and serious evaluation of physician-assisted suicide and other related issues. In such circumstances, “the . . . challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding . . . liberty interests is entrusted to the ‘laboratory’ of the States . . . in the first instance.”</p>
<p id="fc12bafe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, there is no need to address the question whether suffering patients have a constitutionally cognizable interest in obtaining relief from the suffering that they may experience in the last days of their lives. There is no dispute that dying patients in Washington and New York can obtain palliative care, even when doing so would hasten their deaths. The difficulty in defining terminal illness and the risk that a dying patient’s request for assistance in ending his or her life might not be truly voluntary justifies the prohibitions on assisted suicide we uphold here.</p>

<p id="fc12bb00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court ends its opinion with the important observation that our holding today is fully consistent with a continuation of the vigorous debate about the “morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide” in a democratic society. I write separately to make it clear that there is also room for further debate about the limits that the Constitution places on the power of the States to punish the practice.</p>
<p id="fc12bb01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, the Court decides that Washington’s statute prohibiting assisted suicide is not invalid “on its face,” that is to say, in all or most cases in which it might be applied. That holding, however, does not foreclose the possibility that some applications of the statute might well be invalid.</p>
<p id="fc12bb02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Court’s opinion demonstrates, Washington’s statute prohibiting assisted suicide has a “plainly legitimate sweep.” While that demonstration provides a sufficient justification for rejecting respondents’ facial challenge, it does not mean that every application of the statute should or will be upheld.</p>
<p id="fc12bb03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">History and tradition provide ample support for refusing to recognize an open-ended constitutional right to commit suicide. Much more than the State’s paternalistic interest in protecting the individual from the irrevocable consequences of an ill-advised decision motivated by temporary concerns is at stake. There is truth in John Donne’s observation that “No man is an island.” The State has an interest in preserving and fostering the benefits that every human being may provide to the community—a community that thrives on the exchange of ideas, expressions of affection, shared memories, and humorous incidents, as well as on the material contributions that its members create and support. The value to others of a person’s life is far too precious to allow the individual to claim a constitutional entitlement to complete autonomy in making a decision to end that life. Thus, I fully agree with the Court that the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause does not include a categorical “right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so.”</p>
<p id="fc12e214-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But just as our conclusion that capital punishment is not always unconstitutional did not preclude later decisions holding that it is sometimes impermissibly cruel, so is it equally clear that a decision upholding a general statutory prohibition of assisted suicide does not mean that every possible application of the statute would be valid. A State, like Washington, that has authorized the death penalty, and thereby has concluded that the sanctity of human life does not require that it always be preserved, must acknowledge that there are situations in which an interest in hastening death is legitimate. Indeed, not only is that interest sometimes legitimate, I am also convinced that there are times when it is entitled to constitutional protection.</p>
<p id="fc12e215-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer,</span> concurring in the judgments.</p>
<p id="fc12e216-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that the critical question in both of the cases before us is whether “the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes a right” of the sort that the respondents assert. I do not agree, however, with the Court’s formulation of that claimed “liberty” interest. The Court describes it as a “right to commit suicide with another’s assistance.” But I would not reject the respondents’ claim without considering a different formulation, for which our legal tradition may provide greater support. That formulation would use words roughly like a “right to die with dignity.” But irrespective of the exact words used, at its core would lie personal control over the manner of death, <span title="1028" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1028">p. 1028</span>professional medical assistance, and the avoidance of unnecessary and severe physical suffering—combined.</p>
<p id="fc12e217-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondents here argue that one can find a “right to die with dignity” by examining the protection the law has provided for related, but not identical, interests relating to personal dignity, medical treatment, and freedom from state-inflicted pain. I do not believe, however, that this Court need or now should decide whether or a not such a right is “fundamental.” That is because, in my view, the avoidance of severe physical pain (connected with death) would have to constitute an essential part of any successful claim and because, as Justice O’Connor points out, the laws before us do not force a dying person to undergo that kind of pain. Rather, the laws of New York and of Washington do not prohibit doctors from providing patients with drugs sufficient to control pain despite the risk that those drugs themselves will kill. And under these circumstances the laws of New York and Washington would overcome any remaining significant interests and would be justified, regardless.</p>
<p id="fc12e218-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Medical technology, we are repeatedly told, makes the administration of pain-relieving drugs sufficient, except for a very few individuals for whom the ineffectiveness of pain control medicines can mean not pain, but the need for sedation which can end in a coma. We are also told that there are many instances in which patients do not receive the palliative care that, in principle, is available, but that is so for institutional reasons or inadequacies or obstacles, which would seem possible to overcome, and which do not include a prohibitive set of laws. This legal circumstance means that the state laws before us do not infringe directly upon the (assumed) central interest (what I have called the core of the interest in dying with dignity) as, by way of contrast, the state anticontraceptive laws did interfere with the central interest there at stake—by bringing the State’s police powers to bear upon the marital bedroom.</p>
<p id="fc12e219-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were the legal circumstances different—for example, were state law to prevent the provision of palliative care, including the administration of drugs as needed to avoid pain at the end of life—then the law’s impact upon serious and otherwise unavoidable physical pain (accompanying death) would be more directly at issue. And as Justice O’Connor suggests, the Court might have to revisit its conclusions in these cases.</p>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit declared the law unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The Second Circuit said that the New York law discriminated in that those on life support had a right to physician-assisted suicide because <i>Cruzan</i> recognized a right to refuse treatment. But those not on life support had no such right and thus were discriminated against. The Supreme Court rejected this claim.</p>

<p id="fc12e21d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In New York, as in most States, it is a crime to aid another to commit or attempt suicide, but patients may refuse even lifesaving medical treatment.

We hold that it does not.</p>
<p id="fc12e21e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that, despite the assisted-suicide ban’s apparent general applicability, “New York law does not treat equally all competent persons who are in the final stages of fatal illness and wish to hasten their deaths,” because “those in the final stages of terminal illness who are on life-support systems are allowed to hasten their deaths by directing the removal of such systems; but those who are similarly situated, except for the previous attachment of life-sustaining equipment, are not allowed to hasten death by self-administering prescribed drugs.”</p>
<p id="fc12e21f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Equal Protection Clause commands that no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” This provision creates no substantive rights. Instead, it embodies a general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.</p>
<p id="fc12e220-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York’s statutes outlawing assisting suicide affect and address matters of profound significance to all New Yorkers alike. They neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect classifications. These laws are therefore entitled to a “strong presumption of validity.” On their faces, neither New York’s ban on assisting suicide nor its statutes permitting patients to refuse medical treatment treat anyone differently from anyone else or draw any distinctions between persons. Everyone, regardless of physical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to assist a suicide. Generally speaking, laws that apply evenhandedly to all “unquestionably comply” with the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fc12e221-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that some terminally ill people—those who are on life-support systems—are treated differently from those who are not, in that the former may “hasten death” by ending treatment, but the latter may not “hasten death” through physician-assisted suicide. This conclusion depends on the submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical treatment “is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide.” Unlike the Court of Appeals, we think the distinction between assisting suicide and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, a distinction widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession and in our legal traditions, is both important and logical; it is certainly rational.</p>
<p id="fc12e222-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction comports with fundamental legal principles of causation and intent. First, when a patient refuses life-sustaining medical treatment, he dies from an underlying fatal disease or pathology; but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that medication. Furthermore, a physician who withdraws, or honors a patient’s refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment purposefully intends, or may so intend, only to respect his patient’s wishes and “to cease doing useless and futile or degrading things to the patient when [the patient] no longer stands to benefit from them.” The same is true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; in some cases, painkilling drugs may hasten a patient’s death, but the physician’s purpose and intent is, or may be, only to ease his patient’s pain. A doctor who assists a suicide, however, “must, necessarily and indubitably, intend primarily that the patient be made dead.” Similarly, a patient who commits suicide with a doctor’s aid necessarily has the specific intent to end his or her own life, while a patient who refuses or discontinues treatment might not. The law has long used actors’ intent or purpose to distinguish between two acts that may have the same result.</p>
<p id="fc12e223-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1030" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1030">p. 1030</span>Similarly, the overwhelming majority of state legislatures have drawn a clear line between assisting suicide and withdrawing or permitting the refusal of unwanted lifesaving medical treatment by prohibiting the former and permitting the latter. And “nearly all states expressly disapprove of suicide and assisted suicide either in statutes dealing with durable powers of attorney in health-care situations, or in ‘living will’ statutes.” Thus, even as the States move to protect and promote patients’ dignity at the end of life, they remain opposed to physician-assisted suicide.</p>
<p id="fc130934-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York’s reasons for recognizing and acting on this distinction—including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians’ role as their patients’ healers; protecting vulnerable people from indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pressure to end their lives; and avoiding a possible slide towards euthanasia—are discussed in greater detail in our opinion in <i>Glucksberg.</i> These valid and important public interests easily satisfy the constitutional requirement that a legislative classification bear a rational relation to some legitimate end.</p>

But especially the opinions by Justices O’Connor and Breyer indicated that the state does not have an interest in prolonging suffering and that the result may be different in a situation where no alternative to eliminating suffering exists. The question, though, remains as to the circumstances, if any, in which the Court will find laws prohibiting physician-assisted suicide to be unconstitutional as applied.</p>

Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the right to privacy does not protect a right to engage in private consensual homosexual activity. In a five-to-four decision, the Court upheld a Georgia law that prohibited oral-genital or anal-genital contact. Although the statute applied to both heterosexual and homosexual activity, the Court’s opinion focused exclusively on the constitutionality of states’ prohibiting homosexual activity. The Court said that such a right did not exist because it was not supported by the Constitution’s text, the framers’ intent, or tradition.</p>

<p id="fc132f55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance. They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners, John Geddes Lawrence, resided. The right of the police to enter does not seem to have been questioned. The officers observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act. The two petitioners were arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p id="fc132f56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complaints described their crime as “deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man).” The applicable state law is Tex.

<p id="fc132f58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their <span title="1032" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1032">p. 1032</span>liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider the Court’s holding in <i>Bowers.</i></p>
<p id="fc132f59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts in <i>Bowers</i> had some similarities to the instant case. A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male. The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy. One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex. Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid. He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution. The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.</p>
<p id="fc132f5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court began its substantive discussion in <i>Bowers</i> as follows: “The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.” That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Court’s own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in <i>Bowers</i> was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse. The laws involved in <i>Bowers</i> and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.</p>
<p id="fc132f5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects. It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.</p>
<p id="fc132f5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the <i>Bowers</i> Court said: “Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots.” At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter. Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533. The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men. Nineteenth-century <span title="1033" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1033">p. 1033</span>commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men. The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century. Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally. This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct. It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.</p>
<p id="fc132f5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault. As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy. Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.</p>
<p id="fc132f5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the <i>Bowers</i> decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.</p>
<p id="fc132f5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature. We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct. Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices. But far from possessing “ancient roots,” American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century. The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 1880-1995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place. It was not until the 1970’s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so. Post-<i>Bowers</i> even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct. Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them. In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in <i>Bowers</i> are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate. Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.</p>
<p id="fc132f60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in <i>Bowers</i> was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by <span title="1034" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1034">p. 1034</span>religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. “Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.” Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992).</p>
<p id="fc132f61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bowers</i> the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Court’s decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however. Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.</p>
<p id="fc132f62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in <i>Bowers</i> became even more apparent in the years following its announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the <i>Bowers</i> decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct. In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.</p>
<p id="fc135673-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two principal cases decided after <i>Bowers</i> cast its holding into even more doubt. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992), the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The <i>Casey</i> decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows: “These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.” Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do. The decision in <i>Bowers</i> would deny them this right.</p>
<p id="fc135674-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second post-<i>Bowers</i> case of principal relevance is Romer v. Evans (1996). There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. <i>Romer</i> invalidated an amendment to Colorado’s constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by “orientation, conduct, practices or relationships,” and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws. We concluded that the provision was “born of animosity toward the class of persons affected” and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.</p>
<p id="fc135675-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some amici contend that <i>Romer</i> provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. That is a tenable argument, but we <span title="1035" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1035">p. 1035</span>conclude the instant case requires us to address whether <i>Bowers</i> itself has continuing validity. Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.</p>
<p id="fc135676-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central holding of <i>Bowers</i> has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed. Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons. The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system. Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged. The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.</p>
<p id="fc135677-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bowers</i> was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is overruled.</p>
<p id="fc135678-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. “It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.” The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.</p>
<p id="fc135679-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.</p>
<p id="fc13567a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc13567b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today overrules Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). I joined <i>Bowers</i>, and do not join the Court in overruling it. Nevertheless, I agree with the Court that Texas’ statute banning same-sex sodomy is unconstitutional. Rather than relying on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, as the Court does, I base my conclusion on the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fc13567c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” Under our rational basis standard of review, “legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.” Laws such as economic or tax legislation that are scrutinized under rational basis review normally pass constitutional muster, since <span title="1036" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1036">p. 1036</span>“the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes.” We have consistently held, however, that some objectives, such as “a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group,” are not legitimate state interests. When a law exhibits such a desire to harm a politically unpopular group, we have applied a more searching form of rational basis review to strike down such laws under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fc13567d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have been most likely to apply rational basis review to hold a law unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause where, as here, the challenged legislation inhibits personal relationships. The statute at issue here makes sodomy a crime only if a person “engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.” Sodomy between opposite-sex partners, however, is not a crime in Texas. That is, Texas treats the same conduct differently based solely on the participants. Those harmed by this law are people who have a same-sex sexual orientation and thus are more likely to engage in behavior prohibited by §21.06.</p>
<p id="fc13567e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyes of the law by making particular conduct—and only that conduct—subject to criminal sanction. It appears that prosecutions under <span title="1037" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1037">p. 1037</span>Texas’ sodomy law are rare. This case shows, however, that prosecutions under §21.06 do occur. And while the penalty imposed on petitioners in this case was relatively minor, the consequences of conviction are not. And the effect of Texas’ sodomy law is not just limited to the threat of prosecution or consequence of conviction. Texas’ sodomy law brands all homosexuals as criminals, thereby making it more difficult for homosexuals to be treated in the same manner as everyone else. Indeed, Texas itself has previously acknowledged the collateral effects of the law, stipulating in a prior challenge to this action that the law “legally sanctions discrimination against [homosexuals] in a variety of ways unrelated to the criminal law,” including in the areas of “employment, family issues, and housing.”</p>
<p id="fc13567f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas attempts to justify its law, and the effects of the law, by arguing that the statute satisfies rational basis review because it furthers the legitimate governmental interest of the promotion of morality. In <i>Bowers</i>, we held that a state law criminalizing sodomy as applied to homosexual couples did not violate substantive due process. We rejected the argument that no rational basis existed to justify the law, pointing to the government’s interest in promoting morality. The only question in front of the Court in <i>Bowers</i> was whether the substantive component of the Due Process Clause protected a right to engage in homosexual sodomy. <i>Bowers</i> did not hold that moral disapproval of a group is a rational basis under the Equal Protection Clause to criminalize homosexual sodomy when heterosexual sodomy is not punished.</p>
<p id="fc135680-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case raises a different issue than <i>Bowers</i>: whether, under the Equal Protection Clause, moral disapproval is a legitimate state interest to justify by itself a statute that bans homosexual sodomy, but not heterosexual sodomy. It is not. Moral disapproval of this group, like a bare desire to harm the group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause. Indeed, we have never held that moral disapproval, without any other asserted state interest, is a sufficient rationale under the Equal Protection Clause to justify a law that discriminates among groups of persons.</p>
<p id="fc135681-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate governmental interest under the Equal Protection Clause because legal classifications must not be “drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.” Texas’ invocation of moral disapproval as a legitimate state interest proves nothing more than Texas’ desire to criminalize homosexual sodomy. But the Equal Protection Clause prevents a State from creating “a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake.” And because Texas so rarely enforces its sodomy law as applied to private, consensual acts, the law serves more as a statement of dislike and disapproval against homosexuals than as a tool to stop criminal behavior. The Texas sodomy law “raise[s] the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected.”</p>
<p id="fc137d92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas argues, however, that the sodomy law does not discriminate against homosexual persons. Instead, the State maintains that the law discriminates only against homosexual conduct. While it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, Texas’ sodomy law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class. But the State cannot single out one identifiable class of citizens for punishment that does not apply to everyone else, with moral disapproval as the only asserted state interest for the law. The Texas sodomy statute subjects homosexuals to “a lifelong penalty and stigma. A legislative classification that threatens the creation of an underclass . . . cannot be reconciled with” the Equal Protection Clause. Whether a sodomy law that is neutral both in effect and application, would violate the substantive component of the Due Process Clause is an issue that need not be decided today. I am confident, however, that so long as the Equal Protection Clause requires a sodomy law to apply equally to the private consensual conduct of homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, such a law would not long stand in our democratic society.</p>
<p id="fc137d93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A law branding one class of persons as criminal solely based on the State’s moral disapproval of that class and the conduct associated with that class runs contrary to the values of the Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause, under any standard of review. I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment that Texas’ sodomy law banning “deviate sexual intercourse” between consenting adults of the same sex, but not between consenting adults of different sexes, is unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fc137d95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.” Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992). That was the Court’s sententious response, barely more than a decade ago, to those seeking to overrule Roe v. Wade (1973). The Court’s response today, to those who have engaged in a 17-year crusade to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), is very different. The need for stability and certainty presents no barrier.</p>
<p id="fc137d96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the rest of today’s opinion has no relevance to its actual holding—that the Texas statute “furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify” its application to petitioners under rational-basis review. Though there is discussion of “fundamental proposition[s],” and “fundamental decisions,” nowhere does the Court’s opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a “fundamental right” under the Due Process Clause; nor does it subject the Texas law to the standard of review that would be appropriate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual sodomy were a “fundamental right.” Thus, while overruling the outcome of <i>Bowers</i>, the Court leaves strangely untouched its central legal conclusion: “[R]espondent would <span title="1038" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1038">p. 1038</span>have us announce . . . a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. This we are quite unwilling to do.” Instead the Court simply describes petitioners’ conduct as “an exercise of their liberty”—which it undoubtedly is—and proceeds to apply an unheard-of form of rational-basis review that will have far-reaching implications beyond this case.</p>

<p id="fc137d98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I begin with the Court’s surprising readiness to reconsider a decision rendered a mere 17 years ago in Bowers v. Hardwick. I do not myself believe in rigid adherence to stare decisis in constitutional cases; but I do believe that we should be consistent rather than manipulative in invoking the doctrine. Today’s opinions in support of reversal do not bother to distinguish—or indeed, even bother to mention—the paean to stare decisis coauthored by three Members of today’s majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. There, when stare decisis meant preservation of judicially invented abortion rights, the widespread criticism of <i>Roe</i> was strong reason to reaffirm it. Today, however, the widespread opposition to <i>Bowers</i>, a decision resolving an issue as “intensely divisive” as the issue in <i>Roe</i>, is offered as a reason in favor of overruling it. Gone, too, is any “enquiry” (of the sort conducted in <i>Casey</i>) into whether the decision sought to be overruled has “proven unworkable.”</p>
<p id="fc137d99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s approach to stare decisis invites us to overrule an erroneously decided precedent (including an “intensely divisive” decision) if: (1) its foundations have been “eroded” by subsequent decisions, (2) it has been subject to “substantial and continuing” criticism, and (3) it has not induced “individual or societal reliance” that counsels against overturning. The problem is that <i>Roe</i> itself—which today’s majority surely has no disposition to overrule—satisfies these conditions to at least the same degree as <i>Bowers.</i></p>
<p id="fc137d9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of <i>Bowers’</i> validation of laws based on moral choices. Every single one of these laws is called into question by today’s decision; the Court makes no effort to cabin the scope of its decision to exclude them from its holding. The impossibility of distinguishing homosexuality from other traditional “morals” offenses is precisely why <i>Bowers</i> rejected the rational-basis challenge. “The law,” it said, “is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed.”</p>
<p id="fc137d9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What a massive disruption of the current social order, therefore, the overruling of <i>Bowers</i> entails. Not so the overruling of <i>Roe</i>, which would simply have restored the regime that existed for centuries before 1973, in which the permissibility of and restrictions upon abortion were determined legislatively State-by-State.</p>

<p id="fc137d9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having decided that it need not adhere to stare decisis, the Court still must establish that <i>Bowers</i> was wrongly decided and that the Texas statute, as applied to petitioners, is unconstitutional. Texas Penal Code Ann. §21.06(a) (2003) <span title="1039" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1039">p. 1039</span>undoubtedly imposes constraints on liberty. So do laws prohibiting prostitution, recreational use of heroin, and, for that matter, working more than 60 hours per week in a bakery. But there is no right to “liberty” under the Due Process Clause, though today’s opinion repeatedly makes that claim. The Fourteenth Amendment expressly allows States to deprive their citizens of “liberty,” so long as “due process of law” is provided. Our opinions applying the doctrine known as “substantive due process” hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg (1997). We have held repeatedly, in cases the Court today does not overrule, that only fundamental rights qualify for this so-called “heightened scrutiny” protection—that is, rights which are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” All other liberty interests may be abridged or abrogated pursuant to a validly enacted state law if that law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</p>
<p id="fc137d9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bowers</i> held, first, that criminal prohibitions of homosexual sodomy are not subject to heightened scrutiny because they do not implicate a “fundamental right” under the Due Process Clause. The Court today does not overrule this holding. Not once does it describe homosexual sodomy as a “fundamental right” or a “fundamental liberty interest,” nor does it subject the Texas statute to strict scrutiny.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc137d9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">III</p></div>
<p id="fc13a4b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s description of “the state of the law” at the time of <i>Bowers</i> only confirms that <i>Bowers</i> was right. After discussing the history of antisodomy laws, the Court proclaims that, “it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.” This observation in no way casts into doubt the “definitive [historical] conclusion,” on which <i>Bowers</i> relied: that our Nation has a longstanding history of laws prohibiting sodomy in general—regardless of whether it was performed by same-sex or opposite-sex couples: “It is obvious to us that neither of these formulations would extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy. Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots. Sodomy was a criminal offense at common law and was forbidden by the laws of the original 13 States when they ratified the Bill of Rights. In 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, all but 5 of the 37 States in the Union had criminal sodomy laws. In fact, until 1961, all 50 States outlawed sodomy, and today, 24 States and the District of Columbia continue to provide criminal penalties for sodomy performed in private and between consenting adults. Against this background, to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.” Whether homosexual sodomy was prohibited by a law targeted at same-sex sexual relations or by a more general law prohibiting both homosexual and heterosexual sodomy, the only relevant point is that it was criminalized—which suffices to establish that homosexual sodomy is not a right “deeply rooted in our Nation’s history and tradition.” The Court today agrees that homosexual sodomy was criminalized and thus does not dispute the facts on which <i>Bowers</i> actually relied.</p>
<p id="fc13a4b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next the Court makes the claim, again unsupported by any citations, that “[l]aws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting <span title="1040" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1040">p. 1040</span>adults acting in private.” The key qualifier here is “acting in private”—since the Court admits that sodomy laws were enforced against consenting adults. I do not know what “acting in private” means; surely consensual sodomy, like heterosexual intercourse, is rarely performed on stage. If all the Court means by “acting in private” is “on private premises, with the doors closed and windows covered,” it is entirely unsurprising that evidence of enforcement would be hard to come by. (Imagine the circumstances that would enable a search warrant to be obtained for a residence on the ground that there was probable cause to believe that consensual sodomy was then and there occurring.) Surely that lack of evidence would not sustain the proposition that consensual sodomy on private premises with the doors closed and windows covered was regarded as a “fundamental right,” even though all other consensual sodomy was criminalized. There are 203 prosecutions for consensual, adult homosexual sodomy reported in the West Reporting system and official state reporters from the years 1880-1995. There are also records of 20 sodomy prosecutions and 4 executions during the colonial period. <i>Bowers</i>’ conclusion that homosexual sodomy is not a fundamental right “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” is utterly unassailable.</p>
<p id="fc13a4b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, an “emerging awareness” is by definition not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition[s],” as we have said “fundamental right” status requires. Constitutional entitlements do not spring into existence because some States choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions on certain behavior. Much less do they spring into existence, as the Court seems to believe, because foreign nations decriminalize conduct.</p>

<p id="fc13a4b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I turn now to the ground on which the Court squarely rests its holding: the contention that there is no rational basis for the law here under attack. This proposition is so out of accord with our jurisprudence—indeed, with the jurisprudence of any society we know—that it requires little discussion.</p>
<p id="fc13a4b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are “immoral and unacceptable,”—the same interest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. <i>Bowers</i> held that this was a legitimate state interest. The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion. The Texas statute, it says, “furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.” The Court embraces instead Justice Stevens’ declaration in his <i>Bowers</i> dissent, that “the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.” This effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even a legitimate state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws can survive rational-basis review.</p>

<p id="fc13a4b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, I turn to petitioners’ equal-protection challenge, which no Member of the Court, save Justice O’Connor, embraces: On its face §21.06(a) applies <span title="1041" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1041">p. 1041</span>equally to all persons. Men and women, heterosexuals and homosexuals, are all subject to its prohibition of deviate sexual intercourse with someone of the same sex. To be sure, §21.06 does distinguish between the sexes insofar as concerns the partner with whom the sexual acts are performed: men can violate the law only with other men, and women only with other women. But this cannot itself be a denial of equal protection, since it is precisely the same distinction regarding partner that is drawn in state laws prohibiting marriage with someone of the same sex while permitting marriage with someone of the opposite sex. Even if the Texas law does deny equal protection to “homosexuals as a class,” that denial still does not need to be justified by anything more than a rational basis, which our cases show is satisfied by the enforcement of traditional notions of sexual morality.</p>
<p id="fc13a4b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. One of the most revealing statements in today’s opinion is the Court’s grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is “an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.” It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children’s schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as “discrimination” which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession’s anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously “mainstream”; that in most States what the Court calls “discrimination” against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such “discrimination” under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such “discrimination” is mandated by federal statute, see 10 U.S.C. §654(b)(1) (mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such “discrimination” is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale (2000).</p>
<p id="fc13a4b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one’s fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one’s views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts—or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them—than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new “constitutional right” by a Court that is impatient of democratic change.</p>
<p id="fc13a4ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1042" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1042">p. 1042</span>One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts—and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). See Halpern v. Toronto (Ontario Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p id="fc13a4bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is “no legitimate state interest” for purposes of proscribing that conduct, what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising “[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution”? Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case “does not involve” the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so. The matters appropriate for this Court’s resolution are only three: Texas’s prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a “fundamental right” (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.</p>

<p id="fc13cbd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional question presented is whether the State of New York may record, in a centralized computer file, the names and addresses of all persons who have obtained, pursuant to a doctor’s prescription, certain drugs for which there is both a lawful and an unlawful market.</p>
<p id="fc13cbd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many drugs have both legitimate and illegitimate uses. In response to a concern that such drugs were being diverted into unlawful channels, in 1970 the New York Legislature created a special commission to evaluate the State’s drug-control laws. The commission found the existing laws deficient in several respects. There was no effective way to prevent the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, to prevent unscrupulous pharmacists from repeatedly refilling prescriptions, to prevent users from obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor, or to prevent doctors from over-prescribing, either by authorizing an excessive amount in one prescription or by giving one patient multiple prescriptions. In drafting new legislation to correct such defects, the commission consulted with enforcement officials in California and Illinois where central reporting systems were being used effectively.</p>
<p id="fc13cbda-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The new New York statute classified potentially harmful drugs in five schedules. Drugs, such as heroin, which are highly abused and have no recognized medical use, are in Schedule I; they cannot be prescribed. Schedules II through V include drugs which have a progressively lower potential for abuse but also have a recognized medical use. Our concern is limited to Schedule II which includes the most dangerous of the legitimate drugs.</p>
<p id="fc13cbdb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With an exception for emergencies, the Act requires that all prescriptions for Schedule II drugs be prepared by the physician in triplicate on an official form. The completed form identifies the prescribing physician; the dispensing pharmacy; the drug and dosage; and the name, address, and age of the patient. One copy of the form is retained by the physician, the second by the pharmacist, and the third is forwarded to the New York State Department of Health in Albany. A prescription made on an official form may not exceed a 30-day supply, and may not be refilled.</p>
<p id="fc13cbdc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that about 100,000 Schedule II prescription forms are delivered to a receiving room at the Department of Health in Albany each month. They are sorted, coded, and logged and then taken to another room where the data on the forms is recorded on magnetic tapes for processing by a computer. Thereafter, the forms are returned to the receiving room to be retained in a vault for a five-year period and then destroyed as required by the statute. The receiving room is surrounded by a locked wire fence and protected by an alarm system. The computer tapes containing the prescription data are kept in a locked cabinet. When the tapes are used, the computer is run “off-line,” which means that no terminal outside of the computer room can read or record any information. Public disclosure of the identity of patients is expressly prohibited by the statute and by a Department of Health regulation. Willful violation of these prohibitions is a crime punishable by up to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. At the time of trial there were 17 Department of Health employees with access to the files; in addition, there were 24 investigators with <span title="1044" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1044">p. 1044</span>authority to investigate cases of overdispensing which might be identified by the computer. Twenty months after the effective date of the Act, the computerized data had only been used in two investigations involving alleged overuse by specific patients.</p>
<p id="fc13cbdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State legislation which has some effect on individual liberty or privacy may not be held unconstitutional simply because a court finds it unnecessary, in whole or in part.

<p id="fc13cbde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York statute challenged in this case represents a considered attempt to deal with such a problem. It is manifestly the product of an orderly and rational legislative decision. It was recommended by a specially appointed commission which held extensive hearings on the proposed legislation, and drew on experience with similar programs in other States. There surely was nothing unreasonable in the assumption that the patient-identification requirement might aid in the enforcement of laws designed to minimize the misuse of dangerous drugs. For the requirement could reasonably be expected to have a deterrent effect on potential violators as well as to aid in the detection or investigation of specific instances of apparent abuse.</p>
<p id="fc13cbdf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend that the statute invades a constitutionally protected “zone of privacy.” The cases sometimes characterized as protecting “privacy” have in fact involved at least two different kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.</p>
<p id="fc13cbe0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are persuaded, however, that the New York program does not, on its face, pose a sufficiently grievous threat to either interest to establish a constitutional violation. Public disclosure of patient information can come about in three ways. Health Department employees may violate the statute by failing, either deliberately or negligently, to maintain proper security. A patient or a doctor may be accused of a violation and the stored data may be offered in evidence in a judicial proceeding. Or, thirdly, a doctor, a pharmacist, or the patient may voluntarily reveal information on a prescription form.</p>
<p id="fc13cbe1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third possibility existed under the prior law and is entirely unrelated to the existence of the computerized data bank. Neither of the other two possibilities provides a proper ground for attacking the statute as invalid on its face. There is no support in the record, or in the experience of the two States that New York has emulated, for an assumption that the security provisions of the statute will be administered improperly. And the remote possibility that judicial supervision of the evidentiary use of particular items of stored information will provide inadequate protection against unwarranted disclosures is surely not a sufficient reason for invalidating the entire patient-identification program.</p>
<p id="fc13cbe2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even without public disclosure, it is, of course, true that private information must be disclosed to the authorized employees of the New York Department of Health. Such disclosures, however, are not significantly different from those that were required under the prior law. Nor are they meaningfully distinguishable from a host of other unpleasant invasions of privacy that are associated with many facets of health care. Unquestionably, some individuals’ concern for their own privacy may lead them to avoid or to postpone needed medical attention. Nevertheless, disclosures of private medical information to doctors, to hospital personnel, to insurance companies, and to public health agencies are often an <span title="1045" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1045">p. 1045</span>essential part of modern medical practice even when the disclosure may reflect unfavorably on the character of the patient. Requiring such disclosures to representatives of the State having responsibility for the health of the community, does not automatically amount to an impermissible invasion of privacy.</p>
<p id="fc13cbe3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that neither the immediate nor the threatened impact of the patient-identification requirements in the New York State Controlled Substances Act of 1972 on either the reputation or the independence of patients for whom Schedule II drugs are medically indicated is sufficient to constitute an invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc13cbe4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final word about issues we have not decided. We are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in computerized data banks or other massive government files. The collection of taxes, the distribution of welfare and social security benefits, the supervision of public health, the direction of our Armed Forces, and the enforcement of the criminal laws all require the orderly preservation of great quantities of information, much of which is personal in character and potentially embarrassing or harmful if disclosed. The right to collect and use such data for public purposes is typically accompanied by a concomitant statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures. Recognizing that in some circumstances that duty arguably has its roots in the Constitution, nevertheless New York’s statutory scheme, and its implementing administrative procedures, evidence a proper concern with, and protection of, the individual’s interest in privacy. We therefore need not, and do not, decide any question which might be presented by the unwarranted disclosure of accumulated private data whether intentional or unintentional or by a system that did not contain comparable security provisions. We simply hold that this record does not establish an invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fc13cbe5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also has upheld reporting requirements in other areas even though they pose some risk to privacy. For example, in California Bankers Association v. Schultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974), the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, which required banks to maintain records of financial transactions and to report certain domestic and foreign transactions. The Court rejected claims based on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and concluded that the law was constitutional because of the government’s need to monitor financial transactions and to prevent fraudulent conduct.</p>
<p id="fc13f2f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson, 562 U.S. 134 (2011), the Court upheld a requirement for background checks for employees of government contractors working with NASA. The Court said, “We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution protects a privacy right. We hold, however, that the challenged portions of the Government’s background check do not violate this right in the present case.” Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the judgment and declared, “A federal constitutional right to ‘informational privacy’ does not exist.”</p>
<p id="fc13f2f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, although there is a strong argument that the Constitution should be interpreted to protect a right to control information, there is thus far little support for such a right from the Supreme Court.</p>

<p id="fc13f2fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has held that there is a fundamental right to travel and to interstate migration within the United States. Therefore, laws that prohibit or burden travel within the United States must meet strict scrutiny. Although the text of the Constitution does not mention a right to travel, it long has been recognized by the Supreme Court. For example, in the <i>Passenger Cases</i>, Smith v. Turner 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283 (1849), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law imposing a tax on aliens arriving from foreign ports. Even the dissenting justices in the case acknowledged a basic right to interstate travel. Chief Justice Taney, in dissent, remarked, “We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States. And a tax imposed by a State for entering its territories or harbours, is inconsistent with the rights which belong to the citizens of other States as members of the Union, and with the objects which that Union was intended to attain.”</p>

<p id="fc13f302-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. The scheme limits the amount payable to a family that has resided in the State for less than 12 months to the amount payable by the State of the family’s prior residence. The questions presented by this case are whether the 1992 statute was constitutional when it was enacted and, if not, whether an amendment to the Social Security Act enacted by Congress in 1996 affects that determination.</p>

<p id="fc13f304-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">California is not only one of the largest, most populated, and most beautiful States in the Nation; it is also one of the most generous. Like all other States, California has participated in several welfare programs authorized by the Social Security Act and partially funded by the Federal Government. Its programs, however, provide a higher level of benefits and serve more needy citizens than those of most other States. In one year the most expensive of those programs, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which was replaced in 1996 with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), provided benefits for an average of 2,645,814 persons per month at an annual cost to the State of $2.9 billion. In California the cash benefit for a family of two—a mother and one child—is $456 a month, but in the neighboring State of Arizona, for example, it is only $275.</p>

<p id="fc13f307-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The word “travel” is not found in the text of the Constitution. Yet the “constitutional right to travel from one State to another” is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Indeed, as Justice Stewart reminded us in Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), the right is so important that it is “assertable against private interference as well as governmental action . . . a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all.”</p>
<p id="fc13f308-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Shapiro</i>, we reviewed the constitutionality of three statutory provisions that denied welfare assistance to residents of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania, who had resided within those respective jurisdictions less than one year immediately preceding their applications for assistance. Without pausing to identify the specific source of the right, we began by noting that the Court had long “recognized that the nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.” We squarely held that it was “constitutionally impermissible” for a State to enact durational residency requirements for the purpose of inhibiting the migration by needy persons into the State. We further held that a classification that had the effect of imposing a penalty on the exercise of the right to travel violated the Equal Protection Clause “unless shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest,” and that no such showing had been made.</p>
<p id="fc13f309-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “right to travel” discussed in our cases embraces at least three different components. It protects the right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second State, and, for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that State.</p>
<p id="fc13f30a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was the right to go from one place to another, including the right to cross state borders while en route, that was vindicated in Edwards v. California (1941), which invalidated a state law that impeded the free interstate passage of the indigent. We reaffirmed that right in United States v. Guest (1966), which afforded protection to the “‘right to travel freely to and from the State of Georgia and to use highway facilities and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce within the State of Georgia.’” Given that §11450.03 imposed no obstacle to respondents’ entry into California, we think the State is correct when it argues that the statute does not directly impair the exercise of the right to free interstate movement. For the purposes of this case, therefore, we need not identify the source of that particular right in the text of the Constitution. The right of “free ingress and regress to and from” neighboring States, which was expressly mentioned in the text of the Articles of Confederation, may simply have been “conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the stronger Union the Constitution created.”</p>
<p id="fc13f30b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second component of the right to travel is, however, expressly protected by the text of the Constitution. The first sentence of Article IV, §2, provides: <span title="1048" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1048">p. 1048</span>“The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11977_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11977_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span> Thus, by virtue of a person’s state citizenship, a citizen of one State who travels in other States, intending to return home at the end of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the “Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States” that he visits. This provision removes “from the citizens of each State the disabilities of alienage in the other States.” Those protections are not “absolute,” but the Clause “does bar discrimination against citizens of other States where there is no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other States.”</p>
<p id="fc141a1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is at issue in this case, then, is a third aspect of the right to travel—the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State. That right is protected not only by the new arrival’s status as a state citizen, but also by her status as a citizen of the United States. That additional source of protection is plainly identified in the opening words of the Fourteenth Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; . . .” Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> (1872), it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel.</p>
<p id="fc141a1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That newly arrived citizens “have two political capacities, one state and one federal,” adds special force to their claim that they have the same rights as others who share their citizenship. Neither mere rationality nor some intermediate standard of review should be used to judge the constitutionality of a state rule that discriminates against some of its citizens because they have been domiciled in the State for less than a year. The appropriate standard may be more categorical than that articulated in <i>Shapiro</i>, but it is surely no less strict.</p>
<p id="fc141a1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because this case involves discrimination against citizens who have completed their interstate travel, the State’s argument that its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only “incidentally” is beside the point. Were we concerned solely with actual deterrence to migration, we might be persuaded that a partial withholding of benefits constitutes a lesser incursion on the right to travel than an outright denial of all benefits. But since the right to travel embraces the citizen’s right to be treated equally in her new State of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a penalty.</p>
<p id="fc141a20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that respondents and the members of the class that they represent are citizens of California and that their need for welfare benefits is unrelated to the length of time that they have resided in California. We thus have no occasion to consider what weight might be given to a citizen’s length of residence if the bona fides of her claim to state citizenship were questioned. Moreover, because whatever benefits they receive will be consumed while they remain in California, there is no danger that recognition of their claim will encourage citizens of other States to establish residency for just long enough to acquire some readily portable benefit, such as a divorce or a college education, that will be enjoyed after they return to their original domicile.</p>
<p id="fc141a21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1049" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1049">p. 1049</span>The classifications challenged in this case—and there are many—are defined entirely by (a) the period of residency in California and (b) the location of the prior residences of the disfavored class members. But since the right to travel embraces the citizen’s right to be treated equally in her new State of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a penalty.</p>
<p id="fc141a22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disavowing any desire to fence out the indigent, California has instead advanced an entirely fiscal justification for its multitiered scheme. The enforcement of §11450.03 will save the State approximately $10.9 million a year. The question is not whether such saving is a legitimate purpose but whether the State may accomplish that end by the discriminatory means it has chosen. An evenhanded, across-the-board reduction of about 72 cents per month for every beneficiary would produce the same result. But our negative answer to the question does not rest on the weakness of the State’s purported fiscal justification. It rests on the fact that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly equates citizenship with residence: “That Clause does not provide for, and does not allow for, degrees of citizenship based on length of residence.” It is equally clear that the Clause does not tolerate a hierarchy of 45 subclasses of similarly situated citizens based on the location of their prior residence. Neither the duration of respondents’ California residence, nor the identity of their prior States of residence, has any relevance to their need for benefits. Nor do those factors bear any relationship to the State’s interest in making an equitable allocation of the funds to be distributed among its needy citizens.</p>
<p id="fc141a23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question that remains is whether congressional approval of durational residency requirements in the 1996 amendment to the Social Security Act somehow resuscitates the constitutionality of §11450.03. That question is readily answered, for we have consistently held that Congress may not authorize the States to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, the protection afforded to the citizen by the Citizenship Clause of that Amendment is a limitation on the powers of the National Government as well as the States.</p>
<p id="fc141a24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc141a25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the Court’s opinion is unremarkable and sound. The right to travel clearly embraces the right to go from one place to another, and prohibits States from impeding the free interstate passage of citizens. The state law in Edwards v. California (1941), which prohibited the transport of any indigent person into California, was a classic barrier to travel or migration and the Court rightly struck it down. Indeed, for most of this country’s history, what the Court today calls the first “component” of the right to travel, was the entirety of this right.</p>
<p id="fc141a26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But I cannot see how the right to become a citizen of another State is a necessary “component” of the right to travel, or why the Court tries to marry these separate and distinct rights. A person is no longer “traveling” in any sense of the word when he finishes his journey to a State which he plans to make his home. Indeed, under the Court’s logic, the protections of the Privileges or Immunities Clause recognized in this case come into play only when an individual stops traveling with the intent to remain and become a citizen of a new State. The right to travel and the right to become a citizen are distinct, their relationship is not reciprocal, and one is not a “component” of the other.</p>
<p id="fc141a27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In unearthing from its tomb the right to become a state citizen and to be treated equally in the new State of residence, however, the Court ignores a State’s <span title="1050" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1050">p. 1050</span>need to assure that only persons who establish a bona fide residence receive the benefits provided to current residents of the State. While the physical presence element of a bona fide residence is easy to police, the subjective intent element is not. It is simply unworkable and futile to require States to inquire into each new resident’s subjective intent to remain. Hence, States employ objective criteria such as durational residence requirements to test a new resident’s resolve to remain before these new citizens can enjoy certain in-state benefits. Recognizing the practical appeal of such criteria, this Court has repeatedly sanctioned the State’s use of durational residence requirements before new residents receive in-state tuition rates at state universities. Starns v. Malkerson (1971) (upholding 1-year residence requirement for in-state tuition). The Court has declared: “The State can establish such reasonable criteria for in-state status as to make virtually certain that students who are not, in fact, bona fide residents of the State, but have come there solely for educational purposes, cannot take advantage of the in-state rates.” Vlandis v. Kline (1973). The Court has done the same in upholding a 1-year residence requirement for eligibility to obtain a divorce in state courts, see Sosna v. Iowa (1975), and in upholding political party registration restrictions that amounted to a durational residency requirement for voting in primary elections, see Rosario v. Rockefeller (1973).</p>
<p id="fc141a28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If States can require individuals to reside in-state for a year before exercising the right to educational benefits, the right to terminate a marriage, or the right to vote in primary elections that all other state citizens enjoy, then States may surely do the same for welfare benefits. Indeed, there is no material difference between a 1-year residence requirement applied to the level of welfare benefits given out by a State, and the same requirement applied to the level of tuition subsidies at a state university. The welfare payment here and in-state tuition rates are cash subsidies provided to a limited class of people, and California’s standard of living and higher education system make both subsidies quite attractive.</p>
<p id="fc141a29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I therefore believe that the durational residence requirement challenged here is a permissible exercise of the State’s power to “assur[e] that services provided for its residents are enjoyed only by residents.” The 1-year period established in §11450.03 is the same period this Court approved in <i>Starns</i> and <i>Sosna.</i> The requirement does not deprive welfare recipients of all benefits; indeed, the limitation has no effect whatsoever on a recipient’s ability to enjoy the full 5-year period of welfare eligibility; to enjoy the full range of employment, training, and accompanying supportive services; or to take full advantage of health care benefits under Medicaid. This waiting period does not preclude new residents from all cash payments, but merely limits them to what they received in their prior State of residence.</p>

<p id="fc141a2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Saenz</i> reviews the major prior decisions concerning the right to travel. For example, in Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), the Court invalidated a California law that made it a crime to bring a nonresident into the state knowing the individual to be “an indigent person.” The majority opinion, written by Justice Byrne, declared the law unconstitutional as violating the Commerce Clause and did not address the right to travel. However, in concurring opinions, Justices Douglas, Black, Murphy, and Jackson argued that the right to travel is a fundamental right protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the <span title="1051" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1051">p. 1051</span>Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Douglas declared, “[T]he right of persons to move freely from State to State . . . is so fundamental. . . . The right to move freely from State to State is an incident of <i>national</i> citizenship protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against state interference.”</p>
<p id="fc141a2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has articulated and applied the right to travel primarily in evaluating laws that impose durational residency requirements. A durational residency requirement is where a person must live in the jurisdiction for a specified amount of time in order to receive a benefit. Prominent examples involve waiting periods required for receipt of welfare benefits, voting, and divorces. The Supreme Court has recognized that durational residency requirements discourage interstate travel, and especially migration. The Court, therefore, has said that strict scrutiny should be applied in this area.</p>
<p id="fc14413c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The seminal decision was Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), which declared unconstitutional laws that imposed a one-year residency requirement in the state as a prerequisite for eligibility for welfare. The Court said that “[s]ince the classification here touches on the fundamental right of interstate movement, its constitutionality must be judged by the stricter standard of whether it promotes a compelling state interest. Under this standard, the waiting-period requirement clearly violates the Equal Protection Clause.” The Court reviewed the justifications proffered by the states for the waiting period and found that none was sufficient to meet strict scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fc14413d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In subsequent cases, the Court applied <i>Shapiro</i> to invalidate other durational residency requirements. For instance, in Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974), the Court declared unconstitutional a government rule that required a year’s residency in the county as condition to receiving nonemergency hospitalization or medical care at the county’s expense. The Court reviewed the prior decisions in this area and said that they “stand for the proposition that a classification which operates to penalize those persons . . . who have exercised their constitutional right of interstate migration, must be justified by a compelling state interest.”</p>
<p id="fc14413e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court followed this reasoning in invalidating and limiting the length of durational residency requirements for voting. In Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330 (1972), the Court declared unconstitutional a state law that created a one-year residency requirement for voting eligibility. Vanderbilt law professor James Blumstein challenged Tennessee’s waiting period in order to register to vote. The Court noted that the state law drew a distinction among residents solely on the basis of their recent migration and travel.</p>
<p id="fc14413f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that it was thus clear that “the durational residence requirement directly impinges on the exercise of a . . . fundamental personal right, the right to travel.” The Court explained that “it is clear that the freedom to travel includes the ‘freedom to enter and abide in any State in the Union.’ Obviously durational residence laws single out the class of bona fide state and county residents who have recently exercised this constitutionally protected right, and penalize such travelers directly.”</p>
<p id="fc144140-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court rejected each of the state’s justifications and invalidated the law. For example, the state said that the durational residency requirement was justified by the state’s desire to have knowledgeable voters. The Court ruled that a state cannot exclude residents from voting based on an assessment of their knowledge, sophistication with local issues, or how they might vote.</p>
<p id="fc144141-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1052" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1052">p. 1052</span>Subsequently, the Supreme Court has qualified Dunn v. Blumstein and has allowed some residency requirements for voting. The Court has permitted durational residency requirements of up to 50 days for voting to give the government time to check election rolls, prevent fraud, and administer the electoral system.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119F4_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N119F4_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span></p>
<p id="fc144143-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One area where the Court has upheld durational residency requirements is for divorces within a state. In Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state law that required one year of residency in the state before a person could obtain a divorce. The Court distinguished earlier cases invalidating durational residency requirements for receipt of government benefits, such as <i>Shapiro</i> and <i>Maricopa County.</i> The Court said, “But none of those cases intimated that the States might never impose durational residency requirements, and such a proposition was in fact expressly disclaimed. What those cases had in common was that the durational residency requirements they struck down were justified on the basis of budgetary or record-keeping considerations which were held insufficient to outweigh the constitutional claims of the individuals.” The Court felt that the state’s durational residency requirement was “of a different stripe.” The Court said that the difference was that a person moving into the state “would eventually qualify” for eligibility for divorce and “could ultimately have obtained the same opportunity for adjudication which she asserts ought to have been hers at an earlier point in time.”</p>

<p id="fc144146-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Supreme Court has held that there is not a fundamental right to international travel and that therefore only a rational basis test will be used in evaluating restrictions on foreign travel. The Supreme Court’s initial decisions in this area had broad dicta that suggested such a right, but more recent cases have clearly held that the Court does not recognize a fundamental right to foreign travel.</p>
<p id="fc144147-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170 (1978), the Court upheld a provision of the Social Security Act that caused a person to lose Supplemental Security Income benefits for any month during all of which the individual was out of the United States and until the person had been back in the country for 30 consecutive days. The Court expressly distinguished the right to interstate travel from the right to foreign travel; only the former is deemed fundamental. The Court stated, “The constitutional right of interstate travel is virtually unqualified. By contrast, the ‘right’ of international travel has been considered to be no more than an aspect of the ‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. . . . Thus, legislation which is said to infringe the freedom to travel abroad is not to be judged by the same standard applied to laws that penalize the right of interstate travel, such as durational residency requirements imposed by the States.”</p>
<p id="fc144148-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The use of the rational basis test for restrictions on foreign travel was reaffirmed in later cases. In Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), the Court upheld the authority of the Secretary of State to revoke the passport of a former CIA agent who had threatened to identify CIA officers and agents and to take measures <span title="1053" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1053">p. 1053</span>to drive them out of countries where they were operating. The Court emphasized the ability of the government to regulate international travel to further its foreign policy objectives. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, said, “Revocation of a passport undeniably curtails travel, but the freedom to travel abroad . . . is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations; as such, it is subject to reasonable governmental regulation. The Court has made it plain that the freedom to travel outside the United States must be distinguished from the right to travel within the United States.”</p>
<p id="fc144149-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222 (1984), the Court used the rational basis test to uphold a federal regulation that prevented travel to Cuba. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, said, “Matters relating ‘to the conduct of foreign relations . . . are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.’”</p>

<p id="fc14685e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of the amendments to the Constitution concern the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment says, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” The Nineteenth Amendment, adopted in 1920, extended the right to vote to women and says that the “right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”</p>
<p id="fc14685f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Twenty-Fourth Amendment, ratified in 1964, prohibits poll taxes in elections for federal office. Specifically, it provides, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.”</p>
<p id="fc146860-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Twenty-Sixth Amendment, adopted in 1971, extends the right to vote to all citizens who are 18 years of age or older. It says, “The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.”</p>
<p id="fc146861-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these textual provisions, the Supreme Court repeatedly has declared that the right to vote is a fundamental right protected under equal protection.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A47_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A47_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> The right to vote is regarded as fundamental because it is essential in a democratic society; it is obviously through voting that the people choose their government and hold it accountable. The Court has explained that “[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A52_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A52_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span> Hence, “any unjustified discrimination in <span title="1054" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1054">p. 1054</span>determining who may participate in political affairs or in the selection of public officials undermines the legitimacy of representative government.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A5A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A5A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span></p>
<p id="fc146865-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the Court long has said that the right to vote is a “fundamental political right” because it is “preservative of all rights.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A63_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A63_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span> Voting is itself a form of expression, but it also is the way in which people choose a government that will safeguard all of their liberties and interests. As the Court observed, “No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A69_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A69_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span></p>
<p id="fc146868-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it is clearly established that laws infringing the right to vote must meet strict scrutiny. The Court has explained that “[e]specially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A72_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A72_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span></p>
<p id="fc14686a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two major issues concerning the right to vote are discussed below: laws that deny some citizens the right to vote and laws that dilute the voting power of some citizens. The Court has said that “the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A7B_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A7B_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">32</a></span> Other issues concerning voting are discussed in other chapters. For example, race discrimination in election systems is discussed in connection with equal protection in Chapter 7. Issues related to government regulation of political parties and the political process are discussed in Chapter 9.</p>

<p id="fc148f7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Laws that deny or limit the ability of citizens to vote must meet strict scrutiny. For example, as described below, the Supreme Court has used strict scrutiny in evaluating poll taxes, property ownership requirements for voting, and durational residency requirements. However, there are some areas where the Court did not use strict scrutiny and upheld restrictions on voting: literacy tests, laws preventing those convicted of felonies from voting, and a requirement for photo identification for voting. Each of these areas is discussed in turn.</p>

<p id="fc148f88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are suits by Virginia residents to have declared unconstitutional Virginia’s poll tax. Section 173 of Virginia’s Constitution directs the General Assembly to levy an annual poll tax not exceeding $1.50 on every resident of the State 21 years of age and over (with exceptions not relevant here). One dollar of the tax is to be used by state officials “exclusively in aid of the public free schools” and the remainder is to be returned to the counties for general purposes. Section 18 of the Constitution includes payment of poll taxes as a precondition for voting.</p>
<p id="fc148f89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the right to vote in federal elections is conferred by Art. I, §2, of the Constitution, the right to vote in state elections is nowhere expressly mentioned. It is argued that the right to vote in state elections is implicit, particularly by reason of the First Amendment and that it may not constitutionally be conditioned upon the payment of a tax or fee. We do not stop to canvass the relation between voting and political expression. For it is enough to say that once the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc148f8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that a State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax. Our cases demonstrate that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment restrains the States from fixing voter qualifications which invidiously discriminate.</p>
<p id="fc148f8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We say the same whether the citizen, otherwise qualified to vote, has $1.50 in his pocket or nothing at all, pays the fee or fails to pay it. The principle that denies the State the right to dilute a citizen’s vote on account of his economic status or other such factors by analogy bars a system which excludes those unable to pay a fee to vote or who fail to pay.</p>
<p id="fc148f8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is argued that a State may exact fees from citizens for many different kinds of licenses; that if it can demand from all an equal fee for a driver’s license, it can demand from all an equal poll tax for voting. But we must remember that the interest of the State, when it comes to voting, is limited to the power to fix qualifications. Wealth, like race, creed, or color, is not germane to one’s ability to participate intelligently in the electoral process. Lines drawn on the basis of wealth or property, like those of race, are traditionally disfavored. To introduce wealth or payment of a fee as a measure of a voter’s qualifications is to introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor. The degree of the discrimination is irrelevant. In this context—that is, as a condition of obtaining a ballot—the requirement of fee paying causes an “invidious” discrimination that runs afoul of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fc148f8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have long been mindful that where fundamental rights and liberties are asserted under the Equal Protection Clause, classifications which might invade or restrain them must be closely scrutinized and carefully confined. Those principles apply here. For to repeat, wealth or fee paying has, in our view, no relation to voting qualifications; the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so burdened or conditioned.</p>

<p id="fc14b6aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn therefore to question whether the exclusion is necessary to promote a compelling state interest. First appellees argue that the State has a legitimate interest in limiting the franchise in school district elections to “members of the community of interest”—those “primarily interested in such elections.” Second, appellees urge that the State may reasonably and permissibly conclude that “property taxpayers” (including lessees of taxable property who share the tax burden through rent payments) and parents of the children enrolled in the district’s schools are those “primarily interested” in school affairs.</p>
<p id="fc14b6ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not understand appellees to argue that the State is attempting to limit the franchise to those “subjectively concerned” about school matters. Rather, they appear to argue that the State’s legitimate interest is in restricting a voice in school matters to those “directly affected” by such decisions. The State apparently reasons that since the schools are financed in part by local property taxes, <span title="1057" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1057">p. 1057</span>persons whose out-of-pocket expenses are “directly” affected by property tax changes should be allowed to vote. Similarly, parents of children in school are thought to have a “direct” stake in school affairs and are given a vote.</p>
<p id="fc14b6ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees argue that it is necessary to limit the franchise to those “primarily interested” in school affairs because “the ever increasing complexity of the many interacting phases of the school system and structure make it extremely difficult for the electorate fully to understand the whys and wherefores of the detailed operations of the school system.” We need express no opinion as to whether the State in some circumstances might limit the exercise of the franchise to those “primarily interested” or “primarily affected.” Of course, we therefore do not reach the issue of whether these particular elections are of the type in which the franchise may be so limited. For, assuming, arguendo, that New York legitimately might limit the franchise in these school district elections to those “primarily interested in school affairs,” close scrutiny of the §2012 classifications demonstrates that they do not accomplish this purpose with sufficient precision to justify denying appellant the franchise.</p>
<p id="fc14b6ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether classifications allegedly limiting the franchise to those resident citizens “primarily interested” deny those excluded equal protection of the laws depends on whether all those excluded are in fact substantially less interested or affected than those the statute includes. In other words, the classifications must be tailored so that the exclusion of appellant and members of his class is necessary to achieve the articulated state goal. Section 2012 does not meet the exacting standard of precision we require of statutes which selectively distribute the franchise. The classifications in §2012 permit inclusion of many persons who have, at best, a remote and indirect interest, in school affairs and, on the other hand, exclude others who have a distinct and direct interest in the school meeting decisions.</p>
<p id="fc14b6ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do appellees offer any justification for the exclusion of seemingly interested and informed residents—other than to argue that the §2012 classifications include those “whom the State could understandably deem to be the most intimately interested in actions taken by the school board.” But the issue is not whether the legislative judgments are rational. A more exacting standard obtains. The issue is whether the §2012 requirements do in fact sufficiently further a compelling state interest to justify denying the franchise to appellant and members of his class. The requirements of §2012 are not sufficiently tailored to limiting the franchise to those “primarily interested” in school affairs to justify the denial of the franchise to appellant and members of his class.</p>

<p id="fc14b6b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lassiter v. Northampton County Election Bd. this Court upheld against constitutional attack a literacy requirement, applicable to voters in all state and federal elections, imposed by the State of North Carolina. Writing for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Douglas said: “The States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised, absent of course the discrimination which the Constitution condemns.”</p>
<p id="fc14b6b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Believing that the appellant in this case is not the victim of any “discrimination which the Constitution condemns,” I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. Although at times variously phrased, the traditional test of a <span title="1058" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1058">p. 1058</span>statute’s validity under the Equal Protection Clause is a familiar one: a legislative classification is invalid only “if it rest[s] on grounds wholly irrelevant to achievement of the regulation’s objectives.” It was under just such a test that the literacy requirement involved in <i>Lassiter</i> was upheld. The premise of our decision in that case was that a State may constitutionally impose upon its citizens voting requirements reasonably “designed to promote intelligent use of the ballot.” A similar premise underlies the proposition, consistently endorsed by this Court, that a State may exclude nonresidents from participation in its elections. Such residence requirements, designed to help ensure that voters have a substantial stake in the outcome of elections and an opportunity to become familiar with the candidates and issues voted upon, are entirely permissible exercises of state authority.</p>
<p id="fc14b6b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus judged, the statutory classification involved here seems to me clearly to be valid. New York has made the judgment that local educational policy is best left to those persons who have certain direct and definable interests in that policy: those who are either immediately involved as parents of school children or who, as owners or lessees of taxable property are burdened with the local cost of funding school district operations. True, persons outside those classes may be genuinely interested in the conduct of a school district’s business—just as commuters from New Jersey may be genuinely interested in the outcome of a New York City election. But unless this Court is to claim a monopoly of wisdom regarding the sound operation of school systems in the 50 States, I see no way to justify the conclusion that the legislative classification involved here is not rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose. “There is no group more interested in the operation and management of the public schools than the taxpayers who support them and the parents whose children attend them.”</p>
<p id="fc14b6b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, it seems to me that under any equal protection standard, short of a doctrinaire insistence that universal suffrage is somehow mandated by the Constitution, the appellant’s claim must be rejected. [I]t must be emphasized—despite the Court’s undifferentiated references to what it terms “the franchise”—that we are dealing here, not with a general election, but with a limited, special-purpose election. The appellant is eligible to vote in all state, local, and federal elections in which general governmental policy is determined. He is fully able, therefore, to participate not only in the processes by which the requirements for school district voting may be changed, but also in those by which the levels of state and federal financial assistance to the District are determined. He clearly is not locked into any self-perpetuating status of exclusion from the electoral process.</p>

<p id="fc14b6b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, <i>Kramer</i> does not mean that all property ownership requirements for voting are invalid. In Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage Dist., 410 U.S. 719 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld state laws that limited voting in water storage district elections to property owners and that apportioned votes according to assessed valuation of land within the districts. The Court emphasized that landowners had a far greater interest in the outcome of the election than other citizens. The Court explained, “Landowners as a class were to bear the entire burden of the district’s costs, and the State could rationally conclude that they, to the exclusion of residents, should be charged with responsibility for <span title="1059" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1059">p. 1059</span>its operation.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B67_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B67_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span> The Court also noted that although the water district has some governmental authority, it does not provide general public services ordinarily attributed to a governing body. Thus, it concluded “that nothing in the Equal Protection Clause precluded California from limiting the voting for directors of appellee district by totally excluding those who merely reside within the district.”</p>
<p id="fc14b6b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court followed and applied <i>Salyer</i> in Ball v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981). <i>Ball</i>, like <i>Salyer</i>, involved a water district election. In <i>Ball</i>, votes were allocated based on property ownership: The basic rule was one acre, one vote. Unlike in <i>Salyer</i>, decisions by the governing body in <i>Ball</i> had a wide impact. The district was a major supplier of hydroelectric power, and about 40 percent of its water went to urban areas for nonagricultural uses.</p>
<p id="fc14ddc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, the Court found that the property ownership requirement for voting was justified. The Court explained that only the landowners were subject to the acreage-based taxing power of the water district. The Court did not deny that others had an interest in and were affected by the decisions of the district. But the Court said that “[t]he <i>Salyer</i> opinion did not say that the selected class of voters for a special public entity must be the only parties at all affected by the operation of the entity, or that their entire economic well-being must depend on that entity. Rather, the question was whether the effect of the entity’s operations on them was disproportionately greater than the effect on those seeking the vote.”</p>

<p id="fc14ddca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has concluded that literacy tests are constitutionally permissible as a qualification for voting, although they have been outlawed by federal statutes. The Court first confronted literacy tests in Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347 (1915), and the Court upheld the ability of states to require passing a literacy test as a condition for voting. However, in <i>Guinn</i> the Court invalidated a “grandfather clause” that exempted from the literacy test anyone, or their lineal descendants, who could have voted on January 1, 1866. Obviously, the effect was to deny the vote to blacks who were ineligible to vote at the end of the Civil War. But apart from the grandfather clause, the Court was explicit that literacy tests are permissible: “No time need be spent on the question of the validity of the literacy test, considered alone, since, as we have seen, its establishment was but the exercise by the state of a lawful power vested in it, not subject to our supervision, and, indeed, its validity is admitted.”</p>
<p id="fc14ddcb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, in 1959 in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections, 360 U.S. 45 (1959), the Court upheld a North Carolina statute that conditioned voting eligibility on a person’s ability to read and write any section of the Constitution in the English language. Justice Douglas, writing for the Court, emphasized that “[t]he States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised, absent of course discrimination which the Constitution condemns.”</p>
<p id="fc14ddcc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the Court concluded that literacy tests may be used because the ability to read and write is relevant to the ability to exercise the franchise intelligently. Justice Douglas wrote, “The ability to read and write likewise has some relation <span title="1060" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1060">p. 1060</span>to standards designed to promote intelligent use of the ballot. Literacy and illiteracy are neutral on race, creed, color, and sex, as reports around the world show. Literacy and intelligence are obviously not synonymous. Illiterate people may be intelligent voters. Yet in our society where newspapers, periodicals, books, and other printed matter canvass and debate campaign issues, a State may conclude that only those who are literate should exercise the franchise.”</p>
<p id="fc14ddcd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, although literacy tests are constitutional, they have been outlawed by federal statute.

<p id="fc14ddd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases have concerned the ability of the state to restrict voting by those held in prison or those convicted of crimes. To summarize the cases described below, states cannot deny the right to vote to those being held waiting for trial and, in fact, must provide them absentee ballots if they have no other way of voting. However, once a person has been convicted of a felony, a state may permanently disenfranchise the individual. But at least where there was evidence of a racially discriminatory purpose behind the law, a state was prevented from permanently denying the right to vote to those convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>
<p id="fc14ddd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a series of cases, the Court considered the duty of the government to provide absentee ballots to those held in jail while waiting for trial. In O’Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524 (1974), the Court held that the government must provide absentee ballots to jail inmates where it is proven that they have no other way of voting. In <i>O’Brien</i>, the record demonstrated that the state refused to provide jail inmates absentee ballots and did not create polling places at jails or transport inmates outside to vote. Actually, the state law was even more irrational: Inmates being held outside their county of residence could receive an absentee ballot, but those in jail within their home county could not obtain an absentee ballot.</p>
<p id="fc14ddd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, once a person has been convicted of a felony, a state may permanently deny the individual the right to vote. In Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), the Court relied on the language of §2 of the Fourteenth Amendment to uphold the ability of states to disenfranchise felons and ex-felons. Section 2, in part, says that “[r]epresentatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.” However, the provision says that representation shall be decreased if a state denies the right to vote to any male citizens, 21 years of age or older, “except for participation in rebellion, or other crimes.” In other words, the provision says that there would be no penalty in terms of representation in the House of Representatives if a state denied the right to vote to those who participated in rebellion or other crimes.</p>
<p id="fc14ddd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1061" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1061">p. 1061</span>The Court, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist, reviewed the legislative history of this provision and also noted that at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, “29 States had provisions in their constitutions which prohibited, or authorized the legislature to prohibit, exercise of the franchise by persons convicted of felonies or infamous crimes.” The Court also relied on earlier decisions, from the late nineteenth century, that denied bigamists and polygamists the right to vote in territorial Utah and Idaho. The Court concluded that a state may deny the right to vote to those convicted of felonies, even if they had completed their sentences and paroles.</p>
<p id="fc14ddd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), the Court invalidated an Alabama law that denied the right to vote to those who had been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude. A federal district court found that the provision had been adopted with the purpose of disenfranchising blacks and that it had that effect. The Supreme Court accepted these findings and said, “Without deciding whether [the law] would be valid if enacted today without any impermissible motivation, we simply observe that its original enactment was motivated by a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of race and the section continues to this day to have that effect.”</p>

<p id="fc14ddd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a requirement for photo identification for voting, an issue that remains controversial. There was no majority opinion for the Court as there was a three-to-three-to-three split among the justices, with six voting to allow the regulation. In reading the case, it is important to focus on what test each group of justices would use. Also, it is important to consider whether this case can be reconciled with other decisions concerning the right to vote, such as those striking down poll taxes and property ownership requirements for voting. It is important to emphasize that <i>Crawford</i> involved a facial challenge to a requirement for photo identification for voting. As-applied challenges have recently succeeded in a number of states, but have not yet been considered by the Supreme Court.</p>

Virginia Bd. of Elections (1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition the right to vote in a state election on the payment of a poll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters’ argument that the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weeding out those voters who did not care enough about public affairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting provided a rational basis for the tax. Applying a stricter standard, we concluded that a State “violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.” We used the term “invidiously discriminate” to describe conduct prohibited under that standard, noting that we had previously held that while a State may obviously impose “reasonable residence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,” it “may not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resident merely because he is a member of the armed services.” Although the State’s justification for the tax was rational, it was invidious because it was irrelevant to the voter’s qualifications.</p>

Rather than applying any “litmus test” that would neatly separate valid from invalid restrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and evaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the “hard judgment” that our adversary system demands.</p>

Moreover, petitioners argue that provisions of the Indiana Criminal Code punishing such conduct as a felony provide adequate protection against the risk that such conduct will occur in the future. It remains true, however, that flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been documented throughout this Nation’s history by respected historians and journalists, that occasional examples have surfaced in recent years, and that Indiana’s own experience with fraudulent voting in the 2003 Democratic primary for East Chicago Mayor—though perpetrated using absentee ballots and not in-person fraud—demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.</p>
<p id="fc1504fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters. Moreover, the interest in orderly administration and accurate recordkeeping provides a sufficient justification for carefully identifying all voters participating in the election process. While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well be debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.</p>
<p id="fc1504fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the State contends that it has an interest in protecting public confidence “in the integrity and legitimacy of representative government.” While that interest is closely related to the State’s interest in preventing voter fraud, public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process has independent significance, because it encourages citizen participation in the democratic process. As the Carter-Baker Report observed, the “electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters.”</p>

<p id="fc1504fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">States employ different methods of identifying eligible voters at the polls. Some merely check off the names of registered voters who identify themselves; others require voters to present registration cards or other documentation before they can vote; some require voters to sign their names so their signatures can be compared with those on file; and in recent years an increasing number of States have relied primarily on photo identification. A photo identification requirement imposes some burdens on voters that other methods of identification do not share. For example, a voter may lose his photo identification, may have his wallet stolen on the way to the polls, or may not resemble the photo in the identification because he recently grew a beard. Burdens of that sort arising from life’s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so frequent as to raise any question about the constitutionality of SEA 483; the availability of the right to cast a provisional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of that character.</p>
<p id="fc1504ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1064" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1064">p. 1064</span>The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are those imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do not possess a current photo identification that complies with the requirements of SEA 483. The fact that most voters already possess a valid driver’s license, or some other form of acceptable identification, would not save the statute under our reasoning in <i>Harper</i>, if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new photo identification. But just as other States provide free voter registration cards, the photo identification cards issued by Indiana’s BMV are also free. For most voters who need them, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV, gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.</p>
<p id="fc150500-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may take judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat heavier burden may be placed on a limited number of persons. They include elderly persons born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate; persons who because of economic or other personal limitations may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their birth certificate or to assemble the other required documentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless persons; and persons with a religious objection to being photographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests, that some members of these classes were registered voters when SEA 483 was enacted, the new identification requirement may have imposed a special burden on their right to vote.</p>
<p id="fc150501-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The severity of that burden is, of course, mitigated by the fact that, if eligible, voters without photo identification may cast provisional ballots that will ultimately be counted. To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit court clerk’s office within 10 days to execute the required affidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would pose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjustified. And even assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to the relief they seek in this litigation.</p>

<p id="fc152c13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad attack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief that would invalidate the statute in all its applications, they bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique balancing analysis that looks specifically at a small number of voters who may experience a special burden under the statute and weighs their burdens against the State’s broad interests in protecting election integrity. Petitioners urge us to ask whether the State’s interests justify the burden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second trip to the circuit court clerk’s office after voting. But on the basis of the evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify either the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of voters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that is fully justified.</p>
<p id="fc152c14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the evidence in the record does not provide us with the number of registered voters without photo identification; Judge Barker found petitioners’ expert’s report to be “utterly incredible and unreliable.” Much of the argument about the numbers of such voters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the accuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court. The record says <span title="1065" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1065">p. 1065</span>virtually nothing about the difficulties faced by either indigent voters or voters with religious objections to being photographed.</p>
<p id="fc152c15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute imposes “excessively burdensome requirements” on any class of voters. When we consider only the statute’s broad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it “imposes only a limited burden on voters’ rights.” The “precise interests” advanced by the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners’ facial challenge to SEA 483.</p>
<p id="fc152c16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated that the proper remedy—even assuming an unjustified burden on some voters—would be to invalidate the entire statute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure, “[w]e must keep in mind that ‘[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.’”</p>

<p id="fc152c18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In their briefs, petitioners stress the fact that all of the Republicans in the General Assembly voted in favor of SEA 483 and the Democrats were unanimous in opposing it. It is fair to infer that partisan considerations may have played a significant role in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considerations had provided the only justification for a photo identification requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483 would suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in <i>Harper</i>.</p>
<p id="fc152c19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications, those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators. The state interests identified as justifications for SEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require us to reject petitioners’ facial attack on the statute. The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting “the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.”</p>

<p id="fc152c1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lead opinion assumes petitioners’ premise that the voter-identification law “may have imposed a special burden on” some voters, but holds that petitioners have not assembled evidence to show that the special burden is severe enough to warrant strict scrutiny. That is true enough, but for the sake of clarity and finality (as well as adherence to precedent), I prefer to decide these cases on the grounds that petitioners’ premise is irrelevant and that the burden at issue is minimal and justified.</p>
<p id="fc152c1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To vote in person in Indiana, everyone must have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free. The State draws no classifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to establish optional absentee and provisional balloting for certain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for religious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo identifications exempted from the burden, since those voters must maintain the accuracy of the information displayed on the identifications, renew them before they expire, and replace them if they are lost.</p>
<p id="fc152c1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our precedents refute the view that individual <span title="1066" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1066">p. 1066</span>impacts are relevant to determining the severity of the burden it imposes. Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, weighing the burden of a nondiscriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly requiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effectively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence. A voter complaining about such a law’s effect on him has no valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of discriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with disparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, e.g., Washington v. Davis (1976). The Fourteenth Amendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious ones, even when their burdens purportedly fall disproportionately on a protected class. A fortiori it does not do so when, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact are not even protected.</p>
<p id="fc152c1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if I thought that stare decisis did not foreclose adopting an individual-focused approach, I would reject it as an original matter. This is an area where the dos and don’ts need to be known in advance of the election, and voter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regulations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case approach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very few new election regulations improve everyone’s lot, so the potential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State reducing the number of polling places would be open to the complaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who live near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the case that some laws already on the books are especially burdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits demanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or expand absentee balloting.</p>
<p id="fc152c1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election process would flout the Constitution’s express commitment of the task to the States. See Art. I, §4. It is for state legislatures to weigh the costs and benefits of possible changes to their election codes, and their judgment must prevail unless it imposes a severe and unjustified overall burden upon the right to vote, or is intended to disadvantage a particular class. Judicial review of their handiwork must apply an objective, uniform standard that will enable them to determine, ex ante, whether the burden they impose is too severe.</p>
<p id="fc152c20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lead opinion’s record-based resolution of these cases, which neither rejects nor embraces the rule of our precedents, provides no certainty, and will embolden litigants who surmise that our precedents have been abandoned. There is no good reason to prefer that course.</p>
<p id="fc152c21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The universally applicable requirements of Indiana’s voter-identification law are eminently reasonable. The burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free photo identification is simply not severe, because it does not “even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.” And the State’s interests are sufficient to sustain that minimal burden. That should end the matter. That the State accommodates some voters by permitting (not requiring) the casting of absentee or provisional ballots, is an indulgence—not a constitutional imperative that falls short of what is required.</p>

<p id="fc152c23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indiana’s “Voter ID Law” threatens to impose nontrivial burdens on the voting right of tens of thousands of the State’s citizens, and a significant percentage of those individuals are likely to be deterred from voting. The statute is unconstitutional under the balancing standard of Burdick v. Takushi (1992): a State <span title="1067" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1067">p. 1067</span>may not burden the right to vote merely by invoking abstract interests, be they legitimate, or even compelling, but must make a particular, factual showing that threats to its interests outweigh the particular impediments it has imposed. The State has made no such justification here, and as to some aspects of its law, it has hardly even tried. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment sustaining the statute.</p>

<p id="fc152c28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Burdick</i>, “the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights,” upon an assessment of the “character and magnitude of the asserted [threatened] injury,” and an estimate of the number of voters likely to be affected.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fc15523a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first set of burdens shown in these cases is the travel costs and fees necessary to get one of the limited variety of federal or state photo identifications needed to cast a regular ballot under the Voter ID Law. The travel is required for the personal visit to a license branch of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), which is demanded of anyone applying for a driver’s license or nondriver photo identification. The need to travel to a BMV branch will affect voters according to their circumstances, with the average person probably viewing it as nothing more than an inconvenience. Poor, old, and disabled voters who do not drive a car, however, may find the trip prohibitive, witness the fact that the BMV has far fewer license branches in each county than there are voting precincts.</p>
<p id="fc15523b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The burden of traveling to a more distant BMV office rather than a conveniently located polling place is probably serious for many of the individuals who lack photo identification, and public transportation in Indiana is fairly limited. According to a report published by Indiana’s Department of Transportation in August 2007, 21 of Indiana’s 92 counties have no public transportation system at all, and as of 2000, nearly 1 in every 10 voters lived within 1 of these 21 counties. State officials recognize the effect that travel costs can have on voter turnout, as in Marion County, for example, where efforts have been made to “establis[h] most polling places in locations even more convenient than the statutory <span title="1068" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1068">p. 1068</span>minimum,” in order to “provid[e] for neighborhood voting.” Although making voters travel farther than what is convenient for most and possible for some does not amount to a “severe” burden under <i>Burdick</i>, that is no reason to ignore the burden altogether. It translates into an obvious economic cost (whether in work time lost, or getting and paying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear to obtain an ID.</p>
<p id="fc15523c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For those voters who can afford the roundtrip, a second financial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identification for the first time, they need to present “‘a birth certificate, a certificate of naturalization, U.S. veterans photo identification, U.S. military photo identification, or a U.S. passport.’” As the lead opinion says, the two most common of these documents come at a price: Indiana counties charge anywhere from $3 to $12 for a birth certificate (and in some other States the fee is significantly higher), and that same price must usually be paid for a first-time passport, since a birth certificate is required to prove U.S. citizenship by birth. The total fees for a passport, moreover, are up to about $100. So most voters must pay at least one fee to get the ID necessary to cast a regular ballot. As with the travel costs, these fees are far from shocking on their face, but in the <i>Burdick</i> analysis it matters that both the travel costs and the fees are disproportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely to deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.</p>

<p id="fc15523e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to the ID requirement for individuals the State considers “indigent” as well as those with religious objections to being photographed, and this sort of exception could in theory provide a way around the costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana’s chosen exception does not amount to much relief.</p>
<p id="fc15523f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law allows these voters who lack the necessary ID to sign the poll book and cast a provisional ballot. As the lead opinion recognizes, though, that is only the first step; to have the provisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in person before the circuit court clerk or county election board within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit attesting to indigency or religious objection to being photographed (or to present an ID at that point). Unlike the trip to the BMV (which, assuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once every four years for renewal of nondriver photo identification), this one must be taken every time a poor person or religious objector wishes to vote, because the State does not allow an affidavit to count in successive elections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least has a handful of license branches in the more populous counties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing these people to travel to the county seat every time they try to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted already, that most counties in Indiana either lack public transportation or offer only limited coverage.</p>
<p id="fc155240-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the need to travel to the county seat each election amounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the 2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which Indiana’s Voter ID Law applied. Thirty-four provisional ballots were cast, but only two provisional voters made it to the County Clerk’s Office within the 10 days.</p>
<p id="fc155241-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obviate the burdens of getting photo identification.

Record evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer yes.</p>
<p id="fc155244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the District Court found that petitioners failed to offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters affected, we may accept that court’s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age residents lack the kind of identification card required by Indiana’s law. The District Court made that estimate by comparing BMV records reproduced in petitioners’ statistician’s report with U.S. Census Bureau figures for Indiana’s voting-age population in 2004, and the State does not argue that these raw data are unreliable.</p>
<p id="fc155245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So a fair reading of the data supports the District Court’s finding that around 43,000 Indiana residents lack the needed identification, and will bear the burdens the law imposes. To be sure, the 43,000 figure has to be discounted to some extent, residents of certain nursing homes being exempted from the photo identification requirement. But the State does not suggest that this narrow exception could possibly reduce 43,000 to an insubstantial number.</p>
<p id="fc155246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is this. Tens of thousands of voting-age residents lack the necessary photo identification. A large proportion of them are likely to be in bad shape economically. The Voter ID Law places hurdles in the way of either getting an ID or of voting provisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic costs. There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a significant number of state residents will be discouraged or disabled from voting.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11D55_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11D55_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span></p>

<p id="fc15524b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the lead opinion sees it, the State has offered four related concerns that suffice to justify the Voter ID Law: modernizing election procedures, combating voter fraud, addressing the consequences of the State’s bloated voter rolls, and protecting public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. On closer look, however, it appears that the first two (which are really just one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter two if anything weaken the State’s case.</p>
<p id="fc15524c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lead opinion’s discussion of the State’s reasons begins with the State’s asserted interests in “election modernization,” and in combating voter fraud. Although these are given separate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvincing; as I understand it, the “effort to modernize elections[]” is not for modernity’s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political) objectives. The State says that it adopted the ID law principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim, not the slogan of “election modernization,” that warrants attention.</p>
<p id="fc15524d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no denying the abstract importance, the compelling nature, of combating voter fraud. But it takes several steps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.</p>
<p id="fc15524e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identification before casting a regular ballot addresses only one form of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The photo ID requirement leaves untouched the problems of absentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter impersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana); of registered voters voting more than once (but maintaining their own identities) in different counties or in different States; of felons and other disqualified individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying; or, for that matter, of ballot-stuffing, ballot miscounting, voter intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the part of officials administering elections.</p>
<p id="fc15524f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And even the State’s interest in deterring a voter from showing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is not must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State has not come across a single instance of in-person voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana’s history. Neither the District Court nor the Indiana General Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given any evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation fraud in the State.</p>
<p id="fc157960-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State responds to the want of evidence with the assertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard to detect. But this is like saying the “man who wasn’t there” is hard to spot, and to know whether difficulty in detection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has to ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would be) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud (e.g., by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trouble documenting. The answer seems to be no; there is reason to think that “impersonation of voters is . . . the most likely type of fraud to be discovered.” This is in part because an individual who impersonates another at the polls commits his fraud in the open, under the scrutiny of local poll workers who may well recognize a fraudulent voter when they hear who he claims to be.</p>
<p id="fc157961-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relative ease of discovering in-person voter impersonation is also owing to the odds that any such fraud will be committed by “organized groups such as campaigns or political parties” rather than by individuals acting alone. It simply <span title="1071" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1071">p. 1071</span>is not worth it for individuals acting alone to commit in-person voter impersonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few who may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is subject to severe criminal penalties.</p>
<p id="fc157962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however difficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be greater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-gauged in-person voter impersonation fraud, it is also far more difficult to conceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State’s argument about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real force.</p>
<p id="fc157963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is left of the State’s claim must be downgraded further for one final reason: regardless of the interest the State may have in adopting a photo identification requirement as a general matter, that interest in no way necessitates the particular burdens the Voter ID Law imposes on poor people and religious objectors. Individuals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to the county seat every time they wish to exercise the franchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the election. Nothing about the State’s interest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement of a post-election trip to the county seat instead of some verification process at the polling places.</p>
<p id="fc157964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s final justification, its interest in safeguarding voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem with claiming this interest lies in its connection to the bloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to suggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State’s electoral process, except its own failure to maintain its rolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the right to vote, but to end the official negligence.</p>
<p id="fc157965-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without a shred of evidence that in-person voter impersonation is a problem in the State, much less a crisis, Indiana has adopted one of the most restrictive photo identification requirements in the country. The State recognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack the necessary federally issued or state-issued identification, but it insists on implementing the requirement immediately, without allowing a transition period for targeted efforts to distribute the required identification to individuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to explain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors to travel all the way to their county seats every time they wish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in the administration of elections it probably owes more to the State’s violation of federal election law than to any imposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on this record, that the State’s interest in adopting its signally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been shown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the right to vote.</p>
<p id="fc157966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Indiana Voter ID Law is thus unconstitutional: the state interests fail to justify the practical limitations placed on the right to vote, and the law imposes an unreasonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and old. I would vacate the judgment of the Seventh Circuit, and remand for further proceedings.</p>

<p id="fc157969-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the 1960s, many state legislatures were badly malapportioned. One district for the legislature often would be far more populous than another district for the same body. Likewise, districts within a state for electing members of the House of Representatives often were significantly malapportioned. <span title="1072" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1072">p. 1072</span>Malapportionment in many areas was a result of population shifts to urban areas. Districts often were not redrawn after urban migration, causing cities to be underrepresented compared with more rural areas. Legislators who benefited from the malapportionment were unlikely to change the districting.</p>
<p id="fc15796a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, the Supreme Court ruled that challenges to malapportionment posed a nonjusticiable political question.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11DB4_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11DB4_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">37</a></span> However, in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Court concluded that equal protection challenges to malapportionment were justiciable.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11DBA_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11DBA_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">38</a></span> Soon after, the Court articulated the rule of one person, one vote; that is, for any legislative body, all districts must be about the same in population size.</p>
<p id="fc15796d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first case to announce this principle was Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963). <i>Gray</i> involved a challenge to the Georgia system of selecting representatives for the Georgia House of the General Assembly on a county basis. An inequality resulted because counties varied widely in population size. Justice Douglas, writing for the Court, explained why this is unconstitutional: “How then can one person be given twice or 10 times the voting power of another person in a statewide election merely because he lives in a rural area or because he lives in the smallest rural county? Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote—whatever their race, whatever their sex, wherever their occupation, whatever their income, and whatever their home may be in that geographic unit. This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”</p>

<p id="fc15a084-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs below alleged that the last apportionment of the Alabama Legislature was based on the 1900 federal census, despite the requirement of the State Constitution that the legislature be reapportioned decennially. They asserted that, since the population growth in the State from 1900 to 1960 had been uneven, Jefferson and other counties were now victims of serious discrimination with respect to the allocation of legislative representation. As a result of the failure of the legislature to reapportion itself, plaintiffs asserted, they were denied “equal suffrage in free and equal elections . . . and the equal protection of the laws” in violation of the Alabama Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc15a085-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 21, 1962, the District Court held that the inequality of the existing representation in the Alabama Legislature violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a finding which the Court noted had been “generally conceded” by the parties to the litigation, since population growth and shifts had converted the 1901 scheme, as perpetuated some 60 years later, into an invidiously discriminatory plan completely lacking in rationality. Under <span title="1073" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1073">p. 1073</span>the existing provisions, applying 1960 census figures, only 25.1% of the State’s total population resided in districts represented by a majority of the members of the Senate, and only 25.7% lived in counties which could elect a majority of the members of the House of Representatives. Population-variance ratios of up to about 41-to-l existed in the Senate, and up to about 16-to-1 in the House. Bullock County, with a population of only 13,462, and Henry County, with a population of only 15,286, each were allocated two seats in the Alabama House, whereas Mobile County, with a population of 314,301, was given only three seats, and Jefferson County, with 634,864 people, had only seven representatives. With respect to senatorial apportionment, since the pertinent Alabama constitutional provisions had been consistently construed as prohibiting the giving of more than one Senate seat to any one county, Jefferson County, with over 600,000 people, was given only one senator, as was Lowndes County, with a 1960 population of only 15,417, and Wilcox County, with only 18,739 people.</p>
<p id="fc15a086-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No effective political remedy to obtain relief against the alleged malapportionment of the Alabama Legislature appears to have been available. No initiative procedure exists under Alabama law. Amendment of the State Constitution can be achieved only after a proposal is adopted by three-fifths of the members of both houses of the legislature and is approved by a majority of the people, or as a result of a constitutional convention convened after approval by the people of a convention call initiated by a majority of both houses of the Alabama Legislature.</p>
<p id="fc15a087-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in federal elections. A consistent line of decisions by this Court in cases involving attempts to deny or restrict the right of suffrage has made this indelibly clear. It has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote, and to have their votes counted. Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.</p>
<p id="fc15a088-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests. As long as ours is a representative form of government, and our legislatures are those instruments of government elected directly by and directly representative of the people, the right to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion is a bedrock of our political system. It could hardly be gainsaid that a constitutional claim had been asserted by an allegation that certain otherwise qualified voters had been entirely prohibited from voting for members of their state legislature. And, if a State should provide that the votes of citizens in one part of the State should be given two times, or five times, or 10 times the weight of votes of citizens in another part of the State, it could hardly be contended that the right to vote of those residing in the disfavored areas had not been effectively diluted. It would appear extraordinary to suggest that a State could be constitutionally permitted to enact a law providing that certain of the State’s voters could vote two, five, or 10 times for their legislative representatives, while voters living elsewhere could vote only once. And it is inconceivable that a state law to the effect that, in counting votes for legislators, the votes of citizens in one part of the State would be multiplied by two, five, or 10, while the votes of persons in another area would be counted only at <span title="1074" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1074">p. 1074</span>face value, could be constitutionally sustainable. Of course, the effect of state legislative districting schemes which give the same number of representatives to unequal numbers of constituents is identical.</p>
<p id="fc15a089-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Overweighting and overvaluation of the votes of those living here has the certain effect of dilution and undervaluation of the votes of those living there. The resulting discrimination against those individual voters living in disfavored areas is easily demonstrable mathematically. Their right to vote is simply not the same right to vote as that of those living in a favored part of the State. Two, five, or 10 of them must vote before the effect of their voting is equivalent to that of their favored neighbor. Weighting the votes of citizens differently, by any method or means, merely because of where they happen to reside, hardly seems justifiable. One must be ever aware that the Constitution forbids “sophisticated as well as simpleminded modes of discrimination.”</p>
<p id="fc15a08a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State legislatures are, historically, the fountainhead of representative government in this country. A number of them have their roots in colonial times, and substantially antedate the creation of our Nation and our Federal Government. Full and effective participation by all citizens in state government requires, therefore, that each citizen have an equally effective voice in the election of members of his state legislature. Modern and viable state government needs, and the Constitution demands, no less.</p>
<p id="fc15a08b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the allocation of legislative representation, all voters, as citizens of a State, stand in the same relation regardless of where they live. Any suggested criteria for the differentiation of citizens are insufficient to justify any discrimination, as to the weight of their votes, unless relevant to the permissible purposes of legislative apportionment. Since the achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is concededly the basic aim of legislative apportionment, we conclude that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the election of state legislators. Diluting the weight of votes because of place of residence impairs basic constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment just as much as invidious discriminations based upon factors such as race or economic status.</p>
<p id="fc15a08c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are advised that States can rationally consider factors other than population in apportioning legislative representation. We are admonished not to restrict the power of the States to impose differing views as to political philosophy on their citizens. We are cautioned about the dangers of entering into political thickets and mathematical quagmires. Our answer is this: a denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection; our oath and our office require no less of us.</p>
<p id="fc15a08d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent that a citizen’s right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen. The fact that an individual lives here or there is not a legitimate reason for overweighting or diluting the efficacy of his vote. The complexions of societies and civilizations change, often with amazing rapidity. A nation once primarily rural in character becomes predominantly urban. Representation schemes once fair and equitable become archaic and outdated. But the basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged—the weight of a citizen’s vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. Population is, of necessity, the starting point for consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies. A citizen, a qualified voter, is no more nor no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm. This is the clear and strong command of our Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. <span title="1075" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1075">p. 1075</span>This is an essential part of the concept of a government of laws and not men. This is at the heart of Lincoln’s vision of “government of the people, by the people, [and] for the people.” The Equal Protection Clause demands no less than substantially equal state legislative representation for all citizens, of all places as well as of all races.</p>
<p id="fc15a08e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis. Simply stated, an individual’s right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State.</p>
<p id="fc15a08f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since neither of the houses of the Alabama Legislature, under any of the three plans considered by the District Court, was apportioned on a population basis, we would be justified in proceeding no further. However, one of the proposed plans, that contained in the so-called 67-Senator Amendment, at least superficially resembles the scheme of legislative representation followed in the Federal Congress. Under this plan, each of Alabama’s 67 counties is allotted one senator, and no counties are given more than one Senate seat. Arguably, this is analogous to the allocation of two Senate seats, in the Federal Congress, to each of the 50 States, regardless of population.</p>
<p id="fc15a090-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The system of representation in the two Houses of the Federal Congress is one ingrained in our Constitution, as part of the law of the land. It is one conceived out of compromise and concession indispensable to the establishment of our federal republic. Arising from unique historical circumstances, it is based on the consideration that in establishing our type of federalism a group of formerly independent States bound themselves together under one national government. Admittedly, the original 13 States surrendered some of their sovereignty in agreeing to join together “to form a more perfect Union.” But at the heart of our constitutional system remains the concept of separate and distinct governmental entities which have delegated some, but not all, of their formerly held powers to the single national government.</p>
<p id="fc15a091-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Political subdivisions of States—counties, cities, or whatever—never were and never have been considered as sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as subordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state governmental functions. Thus, we conclude that the plan contained in the 67-Senator Amendment for apportioning seats in the Alabama Legislature cannot be sustained by recourse to the so-called federal analogy.</p>
<p id="fc15a092-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By holding that as a federal constitutional requisite both houses of a state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis, we mean that the Equal Protection Clause requires that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable. We realize that it is a practical impossibility to arrange legislative districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters. Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement.</p>
<p id="fc15a093-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Harlan,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc15a094-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these cases the Court holds that seats in the legislatures of six States are apportioned in ways that violate the Federal Constitution.

These decisions have the effect of placing basic aspects of state political systems under the pervasive overlordship of the federal judiciary. I must register my protest.</p>
<p id="fc15c7a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s holding is that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires every State to structure its legislature so that all the members of each house represent substantially the same number of people; other factors may be given play only to the extent that they do not significantly encroach on this basic “population” principle. Whatever may be thought of this holding as a piece of political ideology—and even on that score the political history and practices of this country from its earliest beginnings leave wide room for debate—I think it demonstrable that the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose this political tenet on the States or authorize this Court to do so.</p>
<p id="fc15c7a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had the Court paused to probe more deeply into the matter, it would have found that the Equal Protection Clause was never intended to inhibit the States in choosing any democratic method they pleased for the apportionment of their legislatures. This is shown by the language of the Fourteenth Amendment taken as a whole, by the understanding of those who proposed and ratified it, and by the political practices of the States at the time the Amendment was adopted. It is confirmed by numerous state and congressional actions since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, and by the common understanding of the Amendment as evidenced by subsequent constitutional amendments and decisions of this Court before Baker v. Carr made an abrupt break with the past in 1962.</p>
<p id="fc15c7a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The failure of the Court to consider any of these matters cannot be excused or explained by any concept of “developing” constitutionalism. It is meaningless to speak of constitutional “development” when both the language and history of the controlling provisions of the Constitution are wholly ignored. Since it can, I think, be shown beyond doubt that state legislative apportionments, as such, are wholly free of constitutional limitations, save such as may be imposed by the Republican Form of Government Clause (Const., Art. IV, §4), the Court’s action now bringing them within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment amounts to nothing less than an exercise of the amending power by this Court. So far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, the complaints in these cases should all have been dismissed below for failure to state a cause of action, because what has been alleged or proved shows no violation of any constitutional right.</p>

<p id="fc15c7a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court followed this rationale in Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), and declared unconstitutional districts for the House of Representatives where some districts had twice as many people as others. Specifically, one district had 823,680 people, compared with another district that had 394,312. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Black, discussed, at length, the framers’ theory of representative democracy and again concluded that the rule is “one person, one vote.” The Court concluded: “While it may not be possible to draw congressional districts with mathematical precision, that is no excuse for ignoring our Constitution’s plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fundamental goal of the House of Representatives. That is the high standard of justice and common sense which the Founders set for us.”</p>

No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined. Our Constitution leaves no room for classification of people in a way that unnecessarily abridges this right. While it may not be possible to draw congressional districts with mathematical precision, that is no excuse for ignoring our Constitution’s plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fundamental goal for the House of Representatives. That is the high standard of justice and common sense which the Founders set for us.”</p>
<p id="fc15c7aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a companion case to <i>Reynolds</i>, Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly, 377 U.S. 713 (1964), the Court said that it was irrelevant that voters, by initiative, had approved the malapportionment. The Court explained that one person, one vote is a constitutional mandate and that voter approval does not justify a violation, any more than voter approval would permit the violation of any other constitutional right. The Court observed that “[a]n individual’s constitutionally protected right to cast an equally weighted vote cannot be denied even by a vote of a majority of a State’s electorate.”</p>
<p id="fc15c7ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle of one person, one vote has been extended to all forms of local governments. In Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 485 (1968), the Court said that one person, one vote applied to county commissioners who had “general government powers over the entire geographic area served by the body.” In Hadley v. Junior College District, 397 U.S. 50 (1970), the principle was applied to an elected body with limited governing authority: a junior college district. The elected body had the authority to tax, to employ teachers, and to manage the educational program. The Court rejected earlier attempts to distinguish legislative officials from administrative ones. The Court said that all elected officials must be selected in a manner that avoids vote dilution. The Court stated, “[A]s a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to select persons by popular election to perform governmental functions, [equal protection] requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in that election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district must be established on a basis that will insure, as far as practicable, that equal numbers of voters can vote for proportionately equal numbers of officials.”</p>
<p id="fc15c7ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule of one person, one vote does not require mathematical exactness in the size of districts, but only relatively small deviations are tolerated. More latitude is given to deviations in districting for state and local offices than for districts for the U.S. House of Representatives. In Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969), the Court invalidated districting for the House of Representatives where the “most populous district was 3.13% above the mathematical ideal, and the least populous was 2.84% below.” The Court emphasized that the government must “make a good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.” In White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783 (1973), the Court declared uncon stitutional even smaller deviations in districts for the House of Representatives. The Court repeatedly has emphasized that, especially with regard to elections for federal offices, any deviation must be justified. For example, in Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725 (1983), the Court declared unconstitutional districting for the House of Representatives where the deviation between them was 0.7 percent. This <span title="1078" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1078">p. 1078</span>deviation was impermissible because the state could offer no justification as to why it was needed.</p>
<p id="fc15c7ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, though, has allowed more deviation in districts for electing state and local officials. In Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315 (1973), the Court expressly said that “broader latitude has been afforded the States under the Equal Protection Clause in state legislative redistricting.” For example, in <i>Mahan</i>, the Court allowed deviations where the overrepresented districts exceeded the ideal by 6.8 percent and the underrepresented districts were 9.6 percent away from the target. In White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973), the Court allowed an apportionment scheme where the total variation between the largest and the smallest district was 9.9 percent, though the Court indicated that this was near the maximum allowable deviation.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E65_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11E65_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">39</a></span> In Harris v. Arizona Independent Districting Commission, 136 S. Ct. 1301 (2016), the Court reaffirmed that districts for state and local elections are presumptively valid so long as the deviations are less than 10 percent. The Court declared: “[I]n a case like this one, those attacking a state-approved plan must show that it is more probable than not that a deviation of less than 10% reflects the predominance of illegitimate reapportionment factors rather than the ‘legitimate considerations.’ Given the inherent difficulty of measuring and comparing factors that may legitimately account for small deviations from strict mathematical equality, we believe that attacks on deviations under 10% will succeed only rarely, in unusual cases.”</p>
<p id="fc15c7af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt that the reapportionment decisions have had an enormous effect on American government. Although they were extremely controversial in the 1960s, they are now seen as a paradigm of the judiciary acting to perfect the political process and reinforce democracy.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E71_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11E71_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">40</a></span> Reapportionment was very unlikely to occur without judicial action because officeholders were not likely to give up their seats voluntarily. The decisions dramatically changed the composition of state legislatures and thus undoubtedly affected the laws adopted.</p>
<p id="fc15c7b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet some still criticize the cases as being excessive judicial activism because there was no authority in the text or the framers’ intent for the rule of one person, one vote.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E80_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11E80_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">41</a></span> The critics see the decisions as improper judicial interference, unsupported by the text of the Constitution or the framers’ intent, with the political process.</p>
<p id="fc15c7b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“One-person one-vote” has been understood to mean that for any elected body with districts, all districts must be about the same in population. But in Evenwel v. Abbott, the Court considered the argument that districting must be based on the number of eligible voters, so that all voters have the same chance for equal influence, and not based on total population. The Court rejected this argument and held that total population is a permissible basis for drawing election districts. Notice, though, that the Court did not reach the question of whether it also would be permissible to use eligible voters in drawing election districts.</p>

<p id="fc15eeca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas, like all other States, draws its legislative districts on the basis of total population. Plaintiffs-appellants are Texas voters; they challenge this uniform method of districting on the ground that it produces unequal districts when measured by voter-eligible population. Voter-eligible population, not total population, they urge, must be used to ensure that their votes will not be devalued in relation to citizens’ votes in other districts. We hold, based on constitutional history, this Court’s decisions, and longstanding practice, that a State may draw its legislative districts based on total population.</p>

<p id="fc15eecd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), the Court invalidated Georgia’s malapportioned congressional map, under which the population of one congressional district was “two to three times” larger than the population of the others. Relying on Article I, §2, of the Constitution, the Court required that congressional districts be drawn with equal populations. Later that same Term, in Reynolds v. Sims<i>,</i> (1964), the Court upheld an equal protection challenge to Alabama’s malapportioned state-legislative maps. “[T]he Equal Protection Clause,” the Court concluded, “requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.” <i>Wesberry</i> and <i>Reynolds</i> together instructed that jurisdictions must design both congressional and state-legislative districts with equal populations, and must regularly reapportion districts to prevent malapportionment.</p>
<p id="fc15eece-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to repeated disputes over the permissibility of deviating from perfect population equality, little controversy has centered on the population base jurisdictions must equalize. On rare occasions, jurisdictions have relied on the registered-voter or voter-eligible populations of districts. See Burns v. Richardson (1966) (holding Hawaii could use a registered-voter population base because of “Hawaii’s special population problems”—in particular, its substantial temporary military population). But, in the overwhelming majority of cases, jurisdictions have equalized total population, as measured by the decennial census. Today, all States use total-population numbers from the census when designing congressional and state-legislative districts, and only seven States adjust those census numbers in any meaningful way.</p>

After the 2010 census, Texas redrew its State Senate districts using a total-population baseline. Appellants Sue Evenwel and Edward Pfenninger live in Texas Senate districts (one and four, respectively) with particularly large eligible- and registered-voter populations. Contending that basing apportionment on total population dilutes their votes in relation to voters in other Senate districts, in violation of the one-person, one-vote principle of the Equal Protection Clause, appellants filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.</p>

As they did before the District Court, appellants insist that the Equal Protection Clause requires jurisdictions to draw state and local legislative districts with equal voter-eligible populations, thus protecting “voter equality,” <i>i.e.,</i> “the right of eligible voters to an equal vote.” To comply with their proposed rule, appellants suggest, jurisdictions should design districts based on citizen-voting-age-population (CVAP) data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), an annual statistical sample of the U.S. population. Texas responds that jurisdictions may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, design districts using any population baseline—including total population and voter-eligible population—so long as the choice is rational and not invidiously discriminatory.</p>

<p id="fc15eed5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with constitutional history. At the time of the founding, the Framers confronted a question analogous to the one at issue here: On what basis should congressional districts be allocated to States? The Framers’ solution, now known as the Great Compromise, was to provide each State the same number of seats in the Senate, and to allocate House seats based on States’ total populations. In other words, the basis of <i>representation</i> in the House was to include all inhabitants—although slaves were counted as only three-fifths of a person—even though States remained free to deny many of those inhabitants the right to participate in the selection of their representatives.</p>
<p id="fc1615e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When debating what is now the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress reconsidered the proper basis for apportioning House seats. Concerned that Southern States would not willingly enfranchise freed slaves, and aware that “a slave’s freedom could swell his state’s population for purposes of representation in the House by one person, rather than only three-fifths,” the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment considered at length the possibility of allocating House seats to States on the basis of voter population.</p>
<p id="fc1615e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The product of these debates was §2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which retained total population as the congressional apportionment base. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, §2 (“Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”).</p>
<p id="fc1615e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants ask us to find in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause a rule inconsistent with this “theory of the Constitution.” But, as the Court recognized in <i>Wesberry,</i> this theory underlies not just the method of allocating House seats to States; it applies as well to the method of apportioning legislative seats within States. “The debates at the [Constitutional] Convention,” the Court explained, “make at least one fact abundantly clear: that when the delegates agreed that the House should represent ‘people,’ they intended that in allocating Congressmen the number assigned to each state should be determined solely <span title="1081" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1081">p. 1081</span>by the number of inhabitants.” It cannot be that the Fourteenth Amendment calls for the apportionment of congressional districts based on total population, but simultaneously prohibits States from apportioning their own legislative districts on the same basis.</p>

<p id="fc1615ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consistent with constitutional history, this Court’s past decisions reinforce the conclusion that States and localities may comply with the one-person, one-vote principle by designing districts with equal total populations. Quoting language from those decisions that, in appellants’ view, supports the principle of equal voting power—and emphasizing the phrase “one-person, one-vote”— appellants contend that the Court had in mind, and constantly meant, that States should equalize the voter-eligible population of districts.</p>
<p id="fc1615eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[F]rom <i>Reynolds</i> on, the Court has consistently looked to total-population figures when evaluating whether districting maps violate the Equal Protection Clause by deviating impermissibly from perfect population equality. See Brief for Appellees 29-31 (collecting cases brought under the Equal Protection Clause). Appellants point to no instance in which the Court has determined the permissibility of deviation based on eligible- or registered-voter data. It would hardly make sense for the Court to have mandated voter equality <i>sub silentio</i> and then used a total-population baseline to evaluate compliance with that rule. More likely, we think, the Court has always assumed the permissibility of drawing districts to equalize total population.</p>

Adopting voter-eligible apportionment as constitutional command would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have followed for decades, even centuries. Appellants have shown no reason for the Court to disturb this longstanding use of total population. As the Framers of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment comprehended, representatives serve all residents, not just those eligible or registered to vote. Nonvoters have an important stake in many policy debates—children, their parents, even their grandparents, for example, have a stake in a strong public-education system—and in receiving constituent services, such as help navigating public-benefits bureaucracies. By ensuring that each representative is subject to requests and suggestions from the same number of constituents, total-population apportionment promotes equitable and effective representation.</p>
<p id="fc1615ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the rule appellants urge has no mooring in the Equal Protection Clause. The Texas Senate map, we therefore conclude, complies with the requirements of the one-person, one-vote principle.

<p id="fc1615f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write separately because this Court has never provided a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle. For 50 years, the Court has struggled to define what right that principle protects. Many of our precedents suggest that <span title="1082" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1082">p. 1082</span>it protects the right of eligible voters to cast votes that receive equal weight. Despite that frequent explanation, our precedents often conclude that the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied when all individuals within a district—voters or not—have an equal share of representation. The majority today concedes that our cases have not produced a clear answer on this point.</p>
<p id="fc1615f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the majority has failed to provide a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle because no such basis exists. The Constitution does not prescribe any one basis for apportionment within States. It instead leaves States significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government. The majority should recognize the futility of choosing only one of these options. The Constitution leaves the choice to the people alone—not to this Court.</p>
<p id="fc1615f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This inconsistency (if not opacity) is not merely a consequence of the Court’s equivocal statements on one person, one vote. The problem is more fundamental. There is simply no way to make a principled choice between interpreting one person, one vote as protecting eligible voters or as protecting total inhabitants within a State. That is because, though those theories are noble, the Constitution does not make either of them the exclusive means of apportionment for state and local representatives. In guaranteeing to the States a “Republican Form of Government,” Art. IV, §4, the Constitution did not resolve whether the ultimate basis of representation is the right of citizens to cast an equal ballot or the right of all inhabitants to have equal representation. The Constitution instead reserves these matters to the people. The majority’s attempt today to divine a single “‘theory of the Constitution’”—apportionment based on representation—rests on a flawed reading of history and wrongly picks one side of a debate that the Framers did not resolve in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc1615f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s attempt to impose its political theory upon the States has produced a morass of problems. These problems are antithetical to the values that the Framers embraced in the Constitution. These problems confirm that the Court has been wrong to entangle itself with the political process.</p>
<p id="fc1615f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First,</i> in embracing one person, one vote, the Court has arrogated to the Judiciary important value judgments that the Constitution reserves to the people. <i>Second,</i> the Court’s efforts to monitor the political process have failed to provide any consistent guidance for the States. Even if it were justifiable for this Court to enforce some principle of majority rule, it has been unable to do so in a principled manner. Our precedents do not address the myriad other ways that minorities (or fleeting majorities) entrench themselves in the political system. States can place policy choices in their constitutions or have supermajoritarian voting rules in a legislative assembly.</p>
<p id="fc1615f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far as the Constitution is concerned, there is no single “correct” way to design a republican government. Any republic will have to reconcile giving power to the people with diminishing the influence of special interests. The wisdom of the Framers was that they recognized this dilemma and left it to the people to resolve. In trying to impose its own theory of democracy, the Court is hopelessly adrift amid political theory and interest-group politics with no guiding legal principles.</p>
<p id="fc1615f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no single “correct” method of apportioning state legislatures.

Appellants contend that Texas was required to create districts that are equal in the number of eligible voters, but I agree with the Court that Texas’ use of total population did not violate the one-person, one-vote rule.</p>
<p id="fc1615f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both practical considerations and precedent support the conclusion that the use of total population is consistent with the one-person, one-vote rule. The decennial census required by the Constitution tallies total population. These statistics are more reliable and less subject to manipulation and dispute than statistics concerning eligible voters. Since <i>Reynolds,</i> States have almost uniformly used total population in attempting to create legislative districts that are equal in size. And with one notable exception, Burns v. Richardson<i>,</i> (1966), this Court’s post-<i>Reynolds</i> cases have likewise looked to total population. Moreover, much of the time, creating districts that are equal in total population also results in the creation of districts that are at least roughly equal in eligible voters. I therefore agree that States are permitted to use total population in redistricting plans.</p>
<p id="fc1615fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this conclusion is sufficient to decide the case before us, Texas asks us to go further and to hold that States, while generally free to use total population statistics, are not barred from using eligible voter statistics. Whether a State is permitted to use some measure other than total population is an important and sensitive question that we can consider if and when we have before us a state districting plan that, unlike the current Texas plan, uses something other than total population as the basis for equalizing the size of districts.</p>

<p id="fc1615fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 12, 2000, for the first time in American history, the Supreme Court essentially decided who would be the next president of the United States.</p>



<div id="fc163d0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc163d0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>THE EVENTS LEADING TO BUSH v. GORE</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fc163d10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The presidential election of Tuesday, November 7, 2000, was one of the closest in American history. By early Wednesday morning, it was clear that the Democratic candidate, Vice President Albert Gore, had won the national popular vote, but the outcome of the electoral vote was uncertain. The presidency turned on Florida and its 25 electoral votes. Early on election night, the television networks called Gore the winner in Florida, only to retract their prediction <span title="1084" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1084">p. 1084</span>later in the evening. In the early hours of Wednesday, November 8, the networks declared George W. Bush the winner of Florida and the presidency, only to recant a short time later and conclude that the outcome in Florida, and thus of the national election, was too close to call.</p>
<p id="fc163d11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 8, the Florida Division of Elections reported that Bush had received 2,909,135 votes and Gore had received 2,907,351 votes. Florida law provides for a recount of votes if the election is decided by less than one-half of 1 percent of the votes cast.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FA7_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11FA7_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">42</a></span></p>
<p id="fc163d13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the difference in votes between the two candidates was less than one-half of 1 percent, Gore immediately asked for a machine recount of the tally of votes in four counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. On November 9, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris declined to extend the statutory deadline for county vote totals beyond November 14. By this point, the machine recount had narrowed Bush’s lead to a mere 327 votes.</p>
<p id="fc163d14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon learning of the close margin between him and Bush, Gore petitioned and received permission to conduct a hand recount in the four counties in question. On Saturday, November 11, Bush sued in federal district court to block the manual recount, but this request was denied.</p>
<p id="fc163d15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, Secretary of State Harris emphasized that she would enforce the November 14 deadline and would not accept late recounts from counties in Florida. She said that the Florida election statute required counties to report their votes within one week of the election, unless one of the statutory exceptions was met. These included “proof of fraud that affects the outcome of the election, substantial noncompliance with statutory election procedures, and a reasonable doubt exist[ing] as to whether the certified results expressed the will of the voters,” or where compliance with the deadline is “prevented as a result of an act of God, or extenuating circumstances beyond control.”</p>
<p id="fc163d16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The four counties submitted their responses and requested acceptance of late completion of totals; Harris denied each one. A suit was brought against Harris in Florida state court to compel her to accept the time for the reporting of the results. On Friday, November 17, the Florida state trial court ruled in favor of Harris. On Monday, November 20, the Florida Supreme Court held a nationally televised hearing. On Tuesday night, November 21, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously reversed the trial court and ordered that the secretary of state accept hand recounts from the four counties if they were completed by Sunday, November 26, at 5:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span>, or Monday morning, if the secretary of state’s office was not open for business on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p id="fc163d17-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court ruled that Florida’s secretary of state abused her discretion in refusing to extend the deadline for certifying elections so as to provide the time needed for the recounts. The Court said it was confronted with a conflict between two statutes. One statute, Fla. Stat. §102.111, provides that local election canvassing boards must provide their results “by 5:00 of the seventh day following an election.” This law was amended in 1989 by §102.112, <span title="1085" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1085">p. 1085</span>which provides that election results may be ignored and board members shall be fined if these deadlines are not met.</p>
<p id="fc163d18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, another statute, Fla. Stat. §102.166(4)(a), specifically allows any candidate to request a manual recount. This provision states, “[A]ny candidate whose name appeared on the ballot . . . or any political party whose candidate’s name appeared on the ballot may file a written request with the county canvassing board for a manual recount.” The law provides that the written request may be made prior to the time the board certifies the returns or within 72 hours after the election—whichever occurs later.</p>
<p id="fc163d19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court expressly noted that these statutes “conflict.” The court relied on “traditional rules of statutory construction”—such as that specific laws prevail over general ones and the more recently enacted law takes precedence over the older one—and concluded that Harris erred in denying the extension of time for the counting.</p>
<p id="fc163d1a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court also said that “a statutory provision will not be construed in such a way that renders meaningless or absurd any other statutory provision.” In order to effectuate the law allowing recounts, the court concluded that time must be allowed in which to conduct the recount. The court said that the secretary of state’s refusal to accept hand recounts was wrong because it completely negated the statute that expressly provided for this.</p>
<p id="fc163d1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Friday, November 24, the day after Thanksgiving, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case and scheduled oral argument for the following Friday, December 1. In an unprecedented order, the Court permitted the broadcasting of the oral argument immediately after it was finished. A few days later, in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd., 531 U.S. 70 (2000), the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Florida Supreme Court for clarification of its earlier decision. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a <i>per curiam</i> opinion, said it was unclear whether the Florida court’s decision was based on its interpretation of the Florida Constitution or Florida statutes. The former apparently would be an impermissible basis for decision, while the latter would be acceptable, based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal election laws. On Monday, December 11—the same day the Supreme Court held oral argument in Bush v. Gore—the Florida Supreme Court issued a decision saying its decision was based on interpreting Florida’s statutes, not its constitution.</p>
<p id="fc163d1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Meanwhile, on Sunday, November 26, some counties asked for additional time to complete their counting. For example, Palm Beach County asked for two additional hours beyond the Sunday 5:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> deadline set by the Florida Supreme Court, particularly because the state Supreme Court expressly had allowed the secretary of state to wait until Monday morning before receiving the recount totals. The secretary of state refused all requests for extensions. On Sunday night, November 26, the Florida Elections Canvassing Commission certified the election results: Bush was determined to be the winner of Florida by 537 votes and thus the winner of Florida’s 25 electoral votes.</p>
<p id="fc163d1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Monday, November 27, Gore filed suit in Florida under the Florida law providing for “contests” of election results.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FE5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11FE5_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">43</a></span> This provision, §102.168(3)(c), <span title="1086" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1086">p. 1086</span>provides that “[r]eceipt of a number of illegal votes or rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election” shall be grounds for a contest. The statute authorizes a court, if it finds there are successful grounds for a contest, to “provide any relief appropriate under such circumstances.” Fla. Stat. §102.168(8).</p>
<p id="fc163d1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Saturday and Sunday, December 2 and 3, a Florida state trial court held a hearing as to whether Gore had met the statutory requirements for a successful contest. On Monday, December 4, the Florida trial court ruled against Gore on the grounds that Gore failed to prove a “reasonable probability” that the election would have turned out differently if not for problems counting ballots.</p>
<p id="fc166430-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court granted review and scheduled oral arguments for Thursday, December 7. On Friday afternoon, December 8, the Florida Supreme Court, by a four-to-three decision, reversed the trial court. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the trial court had used the wrong standard in insisting that Gore demonstrate a “reasonable probability” that the election would have been decided differently. The Florida Supreme Court said the statute requires only a showing of “[r]eceipt of a number of illegal votes or rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election.”</p>
<p id="fc166431-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court ordered “the Supervisor of Elections and the Canvassing Boards, as well as the necessary public officials, in all counties that have not conducted a manual recount or tabulation of the undervotes . . . to do so forthwith, said tabulation to take place in the individual counties where the ballots are located.” The Florida Supreme Court also determined that Palm Beach County and Miami-Dade County, in their earlier manual recounts, had identified a net gain of 215 and 168 legal votes for Vice President Gore and that these should be included in the vote total even though they were reported after the deadline of Sunday, November 26.</p>
<p id="fc166432-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just hours after the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, on Friday night, December 8, a Florida trial court judge ordered that the counting of the uncounted votes commence the next morning and that it be completed by Sunday afternoon, December 10, at 2:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> The judge said that he would resolve any disputes.</p>
<p id="fc166433-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Saturday morning, counting commenced as ordered. At the same time, Bush asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the counting and grant certiorari in the case. In the early afternoon on Saturday, the Supreme Court, in a five-to-four ruling, stayed the counting of the votes in Florida. Justice Stevens dissented on grounds there was not an irreparable injury, which is a requirement for such a stay. Justice Scalia wrote a short opinion, not joined by any other justice, in which he said the requirements for a stay were met. He said that Bush had shown a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and also irreparable injury. Justice Scalia said there were two such harms: First, there would be a cloud over the legitimacy of a Bush presidency if the counting showed Gore ahead, but the counting was disallowed by the Supreme Court. Second, handling of the ballots <span title="1087" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1087">p. 1087</span>would lead to their degradation and prevent a more accurate counting later if that were ordered by the Court.</p>
<p id="fc166434-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Monday, December 11, the Supreme Court held oral arguments. Again, they were broadcast immediately after their completion. On Tuesday night, December 12, at approximately 10:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> eastern time, the Court released its opinion in Bush v. Gore.</p>

<p id="fc168b4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 8, 2000, the Supreme Court of Florida ordered that the Circuit Court of Leon County tabulate by hand 9,000 ballots in Miami-Dade County. It also ordered the inclusion in the certified vote totals of 215 votes identified in Palm Beach County and 168 votes identified in Miami-Dade County for Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., and Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democratic Candidates for President and Vice President. The Supreme Court noted that petitioner, Governor George W. Bush, asserted that the net gain for Vice President Gore in Palm Beach County was 176 votes, and directed the Circuit Court to resolve that dispute on remand.</p>
<p id="fc168b4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court further held that relief would require manual recounts in all Florida counties where so-called undervotes had not been subject to manual tabulation. The court ordered all manual recounts to begin at once. Governor Bush and Richard Cheney, Republican Candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency, filed an emergency application for a stay of this mandate. On December 9, we granted the application, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari, and granted certiorari.</p>
<p id="fc168b4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 8, 2000, the day following the Presidential election, the Florida Division of Elections reported that petitioner, Governor Bush, had received 2,909,135 votes, and respondent, Vice President Gore, had received 2,907,351 votes, a margin of 1,784 for Governor Bush. Because Governor Bush’s margin of victory was less than “one-half of a percent . . . of the votes cast,” an automatic machine recount was conducted under §102.141(4) of the election code, the results of which showed Governor Bush still winning the race but by a diminished margin. Vice President Gore then sought manual recounts in Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, pursuant to Florida’s election protest provisions. Fla. Stat. §102.166 (2000). A dispute arose concerning the deadline for local county canvassing boards to submit their returns to the Secretary of State (Secretary). The Secretary declined to waive the November 14 deadline imposed by statute. The Florida Supreme Court, however, set the deadline at November 26. We granted certiorari and vacated the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, finding considerable uncertainty as to the grounds on which it was based. Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd. (2000) (per curiam). On December 11, the Florida Supreme Court issued a decision on remand reinstating that date.</p>
<p id="fc168b4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1088" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1088">p. 1088</span>On November 26, the Florida Elections Canvassing Commission certified the results of the election and declared Governor Bush the winner of Florida’s 25 electoral votes. On November 27, Vice President Gore, pursuant to Florida’s contest provisions, filed a complaint in Leon County Circuit Court contesting the certification. He sought relief pursuant to §102.168(3)(c), which provides that “[r]eceipt of a number of illegal votes or rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election” shall be grounds for a contest. The Circuit Court denied relief, stating that Vice President Gore failed to meet his burden of proof. He appealed to the First District Court of Appeal, which certified the matter to the Florida Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fc168b50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accepting jurisdiction, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the Circuit Court had been correct to reject Vice President Gore’s challenge to the results certified in Nassau County and his challenge to the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board’s determination that 3,300 ballots cast in that county were not, in the statutory phrase, “legal votes.”</p>
<p id="fc168b51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court held that Vice President Gore had satisfied his burden of proof under §102.168(3)(c) with respect to his challenge to Miami-Dade County’s failure to tabulate, by manual count, 9,000 ballots on which the machines had failed to detect a vote for President (“undervotes”). Noting the closeness of the election, the Court explained that “[o]n this record, there can be no question that there are legal votes within the 9,000 uncounted votes sufficient to place the results of this election in doubt.” A “legal vote,” as determined by the Supreme Court, is “one in which there is a ‘clear indication of the intent of the voter.’” The court therefore ordered a hand recount of the 9,000 ballots in Miami-Dade County. Observing that the contest provisions vest broad discretion in the circuit judge to “provide any relief appropriate under such circumstances,” Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000), the Supreme Court further held that the Circuit Court could order “the Supervisor of Elections and the Canvassing Boards, as well as the necessary public officials, in all counties that have not conducted a manual recount or tabulation of the undervotes . . . to do so forthwith, said tabulation to take place in the individual counties where the ballots are located.”</p>
<p id="fc168b52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court also determined that both Palm Beach County and Miami-Dade County, in their earlier manual recounts, had identified a net gain of 215 and 168 legal votes for Vice President Gore. Rejecting the Circuit Court’s conclusion that Palm Beach County lacked the authority to include the 215 net votes submitted past the November 26 deadline, the Supreme Court explained that the deadline was not intended to exclude votes identified after that date through ongoing manual recounts. As to Miami-Dade County, the Court concluded that although the 168 votes identified were the result of a partial recount, they were “legal votes [that] could change the outcome of the election.” The Supreme Court therefore directed the Circuit Court to include those totals in the certified results, subject to resolution of the actual vote total from the Miami-Dade partial recount.</p>
<p id="fc168b53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, §1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U.S.C. §5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

Nationwide statistics reveal that an estimated 2% of ballots cast do not register a vote for President for whatever reason, including deliberately choosing no candidate at all or some voter error, such as voting for two candidates or insufficiently marking a ballot. In certifying election results, the votes eligible for inclusion in the certification are the votes meeting the properly established legal requirements.</p>

U.S. Const., Art. II, §l. This is the source for the statement in McPherson v. Blacker (1892), that the State legislature’s power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by State legislatures in several States for many years after the Framing of our Constitution. History has now favored the voter, and in each of the several States the citizens themselves vote for Presidential electors. When the state legislature vests the right to vote for President in its people, the right to vote as the legislature has prescribed is fundamental; and one source of its fundamental nature lies in the equal weight accorded to each vote and the equal dignity owed to each voter.</p>

Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its exercise. Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of another. See, e.g., Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections (1966) (“[O]nce the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment”). It must be remembered that “the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” Reynolds v. Sims (1964).</p>
<p id="fc16b26b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no difference between the two sides of the present controversy on these basic propositions. Respondents say that the very purpose of vindicating the right to vote justifies the recount procedures now at issue. The question before us, however, is whether the recount procedures the Florida Supreme Court has adopted are consistent with its obligation to avoid arbitrary and disparate treatment of the members of its electorate.</p>
<p id="fc16b26c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the controversy seems to revolve around ballot cards designed to be perforated by a stylus but which, either through error or deliberate omission, have not been perforated with sufficient precision for a machine to count them. <span title="1090" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1090">p. 1090</span>In some cases a piece of the card—a chad—is hanging, say by two corners. In other cases there is no separation at all, just an indentation.</p>
<p id="fc16b26d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida’s basic command for the count of legally cast votes is to consider the “intent of the voter.” This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.</p>
<p id="fc16b26e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law does not refrain from searching for the intent of the actor in a multitude of circumstances; and in some cases the general command to ascertain intent is not susceptible to much further refinement. In this instance, however, the question is not whether to believe a witness but how to interpret the marks or holes or scratches on an inanimate object, a piece of cardboard or paper which, it is said, might not have registered as a vote during the machine count. The factfinder confronts a thing, not a person. The search for intent can be confined by specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment.</p>
<p id="fc16b26f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The want of those rules here has led to unequal evaluation of ballots in various respects. As seems to have been acknowledged at oral argument, the standards for accepting or rejecting contested ballots might vary not only from county to county but indeed within a single county from one recount team to another.</p>
<p id="fc16b270-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record provides some examples. A monitor in Miami-Dade County testified at trial that he observed that three members of the county canvassing board applied different standards in defining a legal vote. And testimony at trial also revealed that at least one county changed its evaluative standards during the counting process. Palm Beach County, for example, began the process with a 1990 guideline which precluded counting completely attached chads, switched to a rule that considered a vote to be legal if any light could be seen through a chad, changed back to the 1990 rule, and then abandoned any pretense of a per se rule, only to have a court order that the county consider dimpled chads legal. This is not a process with sufficient guarantees of equal treatment.</p>
<p id="fc16b271-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An early case in our one person, one vote jurisprudence arose when a State accorded arbitrary and disparate treatment to voters in its different counties. Gray v. Sanders (1963). The Court found a constitutional violation. We relied on these principles in the context of the Presidential selection process in Moore v. Ogilvie (1969), where we invalidated a county-based procedure that diluted the influence of citizens in larger counties in the nominating process. There we observed that “[t]he idea that one group can be granted greater voting strength than another is hostile to the one man, one vote basis of our representative government.”</p>
<p id="fc16b272-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State Supreme Court ratified this uneven treatment. It mandated that the recount totals from two counties, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, be included in the certified total. The court also appeared to hold sub silentio that the <span title="1091" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1091">p. 1091</span>recount totals from Broward County, which were not completed until after the original November 14 certification by the Secretary of State, were to be considered part of the new certified vote totals even though the county certification was not contested by Vice President Gore. Yet each of the counties used varying standards to determine what was a legal vote. Broward County used a more forgiving standard than Palm Beach County, and uncovered almost three times as many new votes, a result markedly disproportionate to the difference in population between the counties.</p>
<p id="fc16b273-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the recounts in these three counties were not limited to so-called undervotes but extended to all of the ballots. The distinction has real consequences. A manual recount of all ballots identifies not only those ballots which show no vote but also those which contain more than one, the so-called overvotes. Neither category will be counted by the machine. This is not a trivial concern. At oral argument, respondents estimated there are as many as 110,000 overvotes statewide. As a result, the citizen whose ballot was not read by a machine because he failed to vote for a candidate in a way readable by a machine may still have his vote counted in a manual recount; on the other hand, the citizen who marks two candidates in a way discernable by the machine will not have the same opportunity to have his vote count, even if a manual examination of the ballot would reveal the requisite indicia of intent. Furthermore, the citizen who marks two candidates, only one of which is discernable by the machine, will have his vote counted even though it should have been read as an invalid ballot. The State Supreme Court’s inclusion of vote counts based on these variant standards exemplifies concerns with the remedial processes that were under way.</p>
<p id="fc16b274-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That brings the analysis to yet a further equal protection problem. The votes certified by the court included a partial total from one county, Miami-Dade. The Florida Supreme Court’s decision thus gives no assurance that the recounts included in a final certification must be complete. This accommodation no doubt results from the truncated contest period established by the Florida Supreme Court, at respondents’ own urging. The press of time does not diminish the constitutional concern. A desire for speed is not a general excuse for ignoring equal protection guarantees.</p>
<p id="fc16b275-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these difficulties the actual process by which the votes were to be counted under the Florida Supreme Court’s decision raises further concerns. That order did not specify who would recount the ballots. The county canvassing boards were forced to pull together ad hoc teams comprised of judges from various Circuits who had no previous training in handling and interpreting ballots. Furthermore, while others were permitted to observe, they were prohibited from objecting during the recount.</p>
<p id="fc16b276-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recount process, in its features here described, is inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to protect the fundamental right of each voter in the special instance of a statewide recount under the authority of a single state judicial officer. Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.</p>
<p id="fc16b277-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before the Court is not whether local entities, in the exercise of their expertise, may develop different systems for implementing elections. Instead, we are presented with a situation where a state court with the power to assure uniformity has ordered a statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards. When a court orders a statewide remedy, there must be at least some <span title="1092" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1092">p. 1092</span>assurance that the rudimentary requirements of equal treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied.</p>
<p id="fc16b278-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the Court’s assessment that the recount process underway was probably being conducted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court stayed the order directing the recount so it could hear this case and render an expedited decision. The contest provision, as it was mandated by the State Supreme Court, is not well calculated to sustain the confidence that all citizens must have in the outcome of elections. The State has not shown that its procedures include the necessary safeguards. The problem, for instance, of the estimated 110,000 overvotes has not been addressed.</p>
<p id="fc16b279-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon due consideration of the difficulties identified to this point, it is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial additional work. It would require not only the adoption (after opportunity for argument) of adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote, and practicable procedures to implement them, but also orderly judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise. In addition, the Secretary of State has advised that the recount of only a portion of the ballots requires that the vote tabulation equipment be used to screen out undervotes, a function for which the machines were not designed. If a recount of overvotes were also required, perhaps even a second screening would be necessary. Use of the equipment for this purpose, and any new software developed for it, would have to be evaluated for accuracy by the Secretary of State, as required by [Florida law].</p>
<p id="fc16b27a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the State’s electors to “participat[e] fully in the federal electoral process,” as provided in 3 U.S.C. §5. That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive selection of electors be completed by December 12. That date is upon us, and there is no recount procedure in place under the State Supreme Court’s order that comports with minimal constitutional standards. Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional for the reasons we have discussed, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed.</p>
<p id="fc16b27b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy. The only disagreement is as to the remedy. Because the Florida Supreme Court has said that the Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor benefits of 3 U.S.C. §5, Justice Breyer’s proposed remedy—remanding to the Florida Supreme Court for its ordering of a constitutionally proper contest until December 18—contemplates action in violation of the Florida election code, and hence could not be part of an “appropriate” order authorized by Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000).</p>
<p id="fc16d98c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are the members of this Court, and none stand more in admiration of the Constitution’s design to leave the selection of the President to the people, through their legislatures, and to the political sphere.

<p id="fc16d98d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="fc16d991-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We deal here not with an ordinary election, but with an election for the President of the United States. In most cases, comity and respect for federalism compel us to defer to the decisions of state courts on issues of state law. That practice reflects our understanding that the decisions of state courts are definitive pronouncements of the will of the States as sovereigns. Of course, in ordinary cases, the distribution of powers among the branches of a State’s government raises no questions of federal constitutional law, subject to the requirement that the government be republican in character. But there are a few exceptional cases in which the Constitution imposes a duty or confers a power on a particular branch of a State’s government. This is one of them. Article II, §1, cl. 2, provides that “[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,” electors for President and Vice President. Thus, the text of the election law itself, and not just its interpretation by the courts of the States, takes on independent significance.</p>
<p id="fc16d992-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3 U.S.C. §5 informs our application of Art. II, §1, cl. 2, to the Florida statutory scheme, which, as the Florida Supreme Court acknowledged, took that statute into account. Section 5 provides that the State’s selection of electors “shall be conclusive, and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes” if the electors are chosen under laws enacted prior to election day, and if the selection process is completed six days prior to the meeting of the electoral college. As we noted in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd. (2000), “Since §5 contains a principle of federal law that would assure finality of the State’s determination if made pursuant to a state law in effect before the election, a legislative wish to take advantage of the ‘safe harbor’ would counsel against any construction of the Election Code that Congress might deem to be a change in the law.”</p>
<p id="fc16d993-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we are to respect the legislature’s Article II powers, therefore, we must ensure that postelection state-court actions do not frustrate the legislative desire to attain the “safe harbor” provided by §5. In Florida, the legislature has chosen to hold statewide elections to appoint the State’s 25 electors. Importantly, the legislature has delegated the authority to run the elections and to oversee election disputes to the Secretary of State, and to state circuit courts. Isolated sections of the code may well admit of more than one interpretation, but the general coherence of the legislative scheme may not be altered by judicial interpretation so as to wholly change the statutorily provided apportionment of responsibility among these various bodies. In any election but a Presidential election, the Florida Supreme Court can give as little or as much deference to Florida’s executives as it chooses, so far as Article II is concerned, and this Court will have no cause to question the court’s actions. But, with respect to a Presidential election, the court must be both mindful of the legislature’s role under Article II in choosing the manner of appointing electors and deferential to those bodies expressly empowered by the legislature to carry out its constitutional mandate.</p>
<p id="fc16d994-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1094" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1094">p. 1094</span>In order to determine whether a state court has infringed upon the legislature’s authority, we necessarily must examine the law of the State as it existed prior to the action of the court. Though we generally defer to state courts on the interpretation of state law, there are of course areas in which the Constitution requires this Court to undertake an independent, if still deferential, analysis of state law.</p>
<p id="fc16d995-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This inquiry does not imply a disrespect for state courts but rather a respect for the constitutionally prescribed role of state legislatures. To attach definitive weight to the pronouncement of a state court, when the very question at issue is whether the court has actually departed from the statutory meaning, would be to abdicate our responsibility to enforce the explicit requirements of Article II.</p>

<p id="fc16d997-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Acting pursuant to its constitutional grant of authority, the Florida Legislature has created a detailed, if not perfectly crafted, statutory scheme that provides for appointment of Presidential electors by direct election.</p>
<p id="fc16d998-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its latest opinion, however, the court empties certification of [election results as prescribed by Florida law of] virtually all legal consequence during the contest, and in doing so departs from the provisions enacted by the Florida Legislature. The court determined that canvassing boards’ decisions regarding whether to recount ballots past the certification deadline are to be reviewed de novo, although the election code clearly vests discretion whether to recount in the boards, and sets strict deadlines subject to the Secretary’s rejection of late tallies and monetary fines for tardiness. Moreover, the Florida court held that all late vote tallies arriving during the contest period should be automatically included in the certification regardless of the certification deadline, thus virtually eliminating both the deadline and the Secretary’s discretion to disregard recounts that violate it.</p>
<p id="fc16d999-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the court’s interpretation of “legal vote,” and hence its decision to order a contest-period recount, plainly departed from the legislative scheme. Florida statutory law cannot reasonably be thought to require the counting of improperly marked ballots. Each Florida precinct before election day provides instructions on how properly to cast a vote; each polling place on election day contains a working model of the voting machine it uses; and each voting booth contains a sample ballot. In precincts using punch-card ballots, voters are instructed to punch out the ballot cleanly:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc16d99a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">after voting, check your ballot card to be sure your voting selections are clearly and cleanly punched and there are no chips left hanging on the back of the card.</span></p>
</div>
<p id="fc16d99b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No reasonable person would call it “an error in the vote tabulation,” Fla. Stat. §102.166(5), or a “rejection of legal votes,” Fla. Stat. §102.168(3)(c), when electronic or electromechanical equipment performs precisely in the manner designed, and fails to count those ballots that are not marked in the manner that these voting instructions explicitly and prominently specify. The scheme that the Florida Supreme Court’s opinion attributes to the legislature is one in <span title="1095" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1095">p. 1095</span>which machines are required to be “capable of correctly counting votes,” but which nonetheless regularly produces elections in which legal votes are predictably not tabulated, so that in close elections manual recounts are regularly required. This is of course absurd. The Secretary of State, who is authorized by law to issue binding interpretations of the election code, rejected this peculiar reading of the statutes. The Florida Supreme Court, although it must defer to the Secretary’s interpretations, see Krivanek v. Take Back Tampa Political Committee (Fla. 1993), rejected her reasonable interpretation and embraced the peculiar one.</p>
<p id="fc1700ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as we indicated in our remand of the earlier case, in a Presidential election the clearly expressed intent of the legislature must prevail. And there is no basis for reading the Florida statutes as requiring the counting of improperly marked ballots, as an examination of the Florida Supreme Court’s textual analysis shows. For the court to step away from this established practice, prescribed by the Secretary of State, the state official charged by the legislature with “responsibility to . . . [o]btain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of the election laws,” §97.012(1), was to depart from the legislative scheme.</p>

<p id="fc1700ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The scope and nature of the remedy ordered by the Florida Supreme Court jeopardizes the “legislative wish” to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by 3 U.S.C. §5. December 12, 2000, is the last date for a final determination of the Florida electors that will satisfy §5. Yet in the late afternoon of December 8th—four days before this deadline—the Supreme Court of Florida ordered recounts of tens of thousands of so-called “undervotes” spread through 64 of the State’s 67 counties. This was done in a search for elusive—perhaps delusive—certainty as to the exact count of 6 million votes. But no one claims that these ballots have not previously been tabulated; they were initially read by voting machines at the time of the election, and thereafter reread by virtue of Florida’s automatic recount provision. No one claims there was any fraud in the election. The Supreme Court of Florida ordered this additional recount under the provision of the election code giving the circuit judge the authority to provide relief that is “appropriate under such circumstances.”</p>
<p id="fc1700af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surely when the Florida Legislature empowered the courts of the State to grant “appropriate” relief, it must have meant relief that would have become final by the cut-off date of 3 U.S.C. §5. In light of the inevitable legal challenges and ensuing appeals to the Supreme Court of Florida and petitions for certiorari to this Court, the entire recounting process could not possibly be completed by that date.</p>
<p id="fc1700b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given all these factors, and in light of the legislative intent identified by the Florida Supreme Court to bring Florida within the “safe harbor” provision of 3 U.S.C. §5, the remedy prescribed by the Supreme Court of Florida cannot be deemed an “appropriate” one as of December 8. It significantly departed from the statutory framework in place on November 7, and authorized open-ended further proceedings which could not be completed by December 12, thereby preventing a final determination by that date. For these reasons, in addition to those given in the per curiam, we would reverse.</p>

<p id="fc1700b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution assigns to the States the primary responsibility for determining the manner of selecting the Presidential electors. When questions arise about the meaning of state laws, including election laws, it is our settled practice to accept the opinions of the highest courts of the States as providing the final answers. On rare occasions, however, either federal statutes or the Federal Constitution may require federal judicial intervention in state elections. This is not such an occasion.</p>
<p id="fc1700b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal questions that ultimately emerged in this case are not substantial. Article II provides that “[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors.” It does not create state legislatures out of whole cloth, but rather takes them as they come—as creatures born of, and constrained by, their state constitutions. The legislative power in Florida is subject to judicial review pursuant to Article V of the Florida Constitution, and nothing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the state constitution that created it. Moreover, the Florida Legislature’s own decision to employ a unitary code for all elections indicates that it intended the Florida Supreme Court to play the same role in Presidential elections that it has historically played in resolving electoral disputes. The Florida Supreme Court’s exercise of appellate jurisdiction therefore was wholly consistent with, and indeed contemplated by, the grant of authority in Article II.</p>
<p id="fc1700b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It hardly needs stating that Congress, pursuant to 3 U.S.C. §5, did not impose any affirmative duties upon the States that their governmental branches could “violate.” Rather, §5 provides a safe harbor for States to select electors in contested elections “by judicial or other methods” established by laws prior to the election day. Section 5, like Article II, assumes the involvement of the state judiciary in interpreting state election laws and resolving election disputes under those laws. Neither §5 nor Article II grants federal judges any special authority to substitute their views for those of the state judiciary on matters of state law.</p>
<p id="fc1700b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor are petitioners correct in asserting that the failure of the Florida Supreme Court to specify in detail the precise manner in which the “intent of the voter” is to be determined rises to the level of a constitutional violation. We found such a violation when individual votes within the same State were weighted unequally, see, e.g., Reynolds v. Sims (1964), but we have never before called into question the substantive standard by which a State determines that a vote has been legally cast. And there is no reason to think that the guidance provided to the factfinders, specifically the various canvassing boards, by the “intent of the voter” standard is any less sufficient—or will lead to results any less uniform—than, for example, the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard employed everyday by ordinary citizens in courtrooms across this country.</p>
<p id="fc1700b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, the use of differing substandards for determining voter intent in different counties employing similar voting systems may raise serious concerns. Those concerns are alleviated—if not eliminated—by the fact that a single impartial magistrate will ultimately adjudicate all objections arising from the recount process. Of course, as a general matter, “[t]he interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal. We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints.” Bain Peanut Co. of Tex. v. Pinson (1931) (Holmes, J.). If it were otherwise, <span title="1097" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1097">p. 1097</span>Florida’s decision to leave to each county the determination of what balloting system to employ—despite enormous differences in accuracy—might run afoul of equal protection. So, too, might the similar decisions of the vast majority of state legislatures to delegate to local authorities certain decisions with respect to voting systems and ballot design.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12158_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12158_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">44</a></span></p>
<p id="fc1727c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming that aspects of the remedial scheme might ultimately be found to violate the Equal Protection Clause, I could not subscribe to the majority’s disposition of the case. As the majority explicitly holds, once a state legislature determines to select electors through a popular vote, the right to have one’s vote counted is of constitutional stature. As the majority further acknowledges, Florida law holds that all ballots that reveal the intent of the voter constitute valid votes. Recognizing these principles, the majority nonetheless orders the termination of the contest proceeding before all such votes have been tabulated. Under their own reasoning, the appropriate course of action would be to remand to allow more specific procedures for implementing the legislature’s uniform general standard to be established.</p>
<p id="fc1727c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the interest of finality, however, the majority effectively orders the disenfranchisement of an unknown number of voters whose ballots reveal their intent—and are therefore legal votes under state law—but were for some reason rejected by ballot-counting machines. It does so on the basis of the deadlines set forth in Title 3 of the United States Code. But, as I have already noted, those provisions merely provide rules of decision for Congress to follow when selecting among conflicting slates of electors. They do not prohibit a State from counting what the majority concedes to be legal votes until a bona fide winner is determined. Indeed, in 1960, Hawaii appointed two slates of electors and Congress chose to count the one appointed on January 4, 1961, well after the Title 3 deadlines. Thus, nothing prevents the majority, even if it properly found an equal protection violation, from ordering relief appropriate to remedy that violation without depriving Florida voters of their right to have their votes counted. As the majority notes, “[a] desire for speed is not a general excuse for ignoring equal protection guarantees.”</p>
<p id="fc1727ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, neither in this case, nor in its earlier opinion in Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, did the Florida Supreme Court make any substantive change in Florida electoral law. Its decisions were rooted in long-established precedent and were consistent with the relevant statutory provisions, taken as a whole. It did what courts do—it decided the case before it in light of the legislature’s intent to leave no legally cast vote uncounted. In so doing, it relied on the sufficiency of the general “intent of the voter” standard articulated by the state legislature, coupled with a procedure for ultimate review by an impartial judge, to resolve the concern about disparate evaluations of contested ballots. If we assume—as I do—that the members of that court and the judges who would have carried out its mandate are impartial, its decision does not even raise a colorable federal question.</p>
<p id="fc1727cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1098" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1098">p. 1098</span>What must underlie petitioners’ entire federal assault on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today’s decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law. I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc1727cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As will be clear, I am in substantial agreement with the dissenting opinions of Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer. I write separately only to say how straightforward the issues before us really are. There are three issues: whether the State Supreme Court’s interpretation of the statute providing for a contest of the state election results somehow violates 3 U.S.C. §5; whether that court’s construction of the state statutory provisions governing contests impermissibly changes a state law from what the State’s legislature has provided, in violation of Article II, §1, cl. 2, of the national Constitution; and whether the manner of interpreting markings on disputed ballots failing to cause machines to register votes for President (the undervote ballots) violates the equal protection or due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. None of these issues is difficult to describe or to resolve.</p>

<p id="fc1727cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 3 U.S.C. §5 issue is not serious. That provision sets certain conditions for treating a State’s certification of Presidential electors as conclusive in the event that a dispute over recognizing those electors must be resolved in the Congress under 3 U.S.C. §15. Conclusiveness requires selection under a legal scheme in place before the election, with results determined at least six days before the date set for casting electoral votes. But no State is required to conform to §5 if it cannot do that (for whatever reason); the sanction for failing to satisfy the conditions of §5 is simply loss of what has been called its “safe harbor.” And even that determination is to be made, if made anywhere, in the Congress.</p>

<p id="fc174ee1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second matter here goes to the State Supreme Court’s interpretation of certain terms in the state statute governing election “contests.” The issue is whether the judgment of the State Supreme Court has displaced the state legislature’s provisions for election contests: is the law as declared by the court different from the provisions made by the legislature, to which the national Constitution commits responsibility for determining how each State’s Presidential electors are chosen? Bush does not, of course, claim that any judicial act interpreting a statute of uncertain meaning is enough to displace the legislative provision and violate Article II; statutes require interpretation, which does not without <span title="1099" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1099">p. 1099</span>more affect the legislative character of a statute within the meaning of the Constitution. What Bush does argue, as I understand the contention, is that the interpretation of §102.168 was so unreasonable as to transcend the accepted bounds of statutory interpretation, to the point of being a nonjudicial act and producing new law untethered to the legislative act in question.</p>
<p id="fc174ee2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The starting point for evaluating the claim that the Florida Supreme Court’s interpretation effectively re-wrote §102.168 must be the language of the provision on which Gore relies to show his right to raise this contest: that the previously certified result in Bush’s favor was produced by “rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election.” Fla. Stat. §102.168(3)(c) (2000). None of the state court’s interpretations is unreasonable to the point of displacing the legislative enactment quoted.</p>
<p id="fc174ee3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. The statute does not define a “legal vote,” the rejection of which may affect the election. The State Supreme Court was therefore required to define it, and in doing that the court looked to another election statute, §101.5614(5), dealing with damaged or defective ballots, which contains a provision that no vote shall be disregarded “if there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter as determined by a canvassing board.” The court read that objective of looking to the voter’s intent as indicating that the legislature probably meant “legal vote” to mean a vote recorded on a ballot indicating what the voter intended. It is perfectly true that the majority might have chosen a different reading. But even so, there is no constitutional violation in following the majority view; Article II is unconcerned with mere disagreements about interpretive merits.</p>
<p id="fc174ee4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The Florida court next interpreted “rejection” to determine what act in the counting process may be attacked in a contest. Again, the statute does not define the term. The court majority read the word to mean simply a failure to count. That reading is certainly within the bounds of common sense, given the objective to give effect to a voter’s intent if that can be determined. A different reading, of course, is possible. The majority might have concluded that “rejection” should refer to machine malfunction, or that a ballot should not be treated as “reject[ed]” in the absence of wrongdoing by election officials, lest contests be so easy to claim that every election will end up in one. There is, however, nothing nonjudicial in the Florida majority’s more hospitable reading.</p>
<p id="fc174ee5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. The same is true about the court majority’s understanding of the phrase “votes sufficient to change or place in doubt” the result of the election in Florida. The court held that if the uncounted ballots were so numerous that it was reasonably possible that they contained enough “legal” votes to swing the election, this contest would be authorized by the statute. While the majority might have thought (as the trial judge did) that a probability, not a possibility, should be necessary to justify a contest, that reading is not required by the statute’s text, which says nothing about probability. Whatever people of good will and good sense may argue about the merits of the Florida court’s reading, there is no warrant for saying that it transcends the limits of reasonable statutory interpretation to the point of supplanting the statute enacted by the “legislature” within the meaning of Article II.</p>
<p id="fc174ee6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the interpretations by the Florida court raise no substantial question under Article II. That court engaged in permissible construction in determining that Gore had instituted a contest authorized by the state statute, and it proceeded to direct the trial judge to deal with that contest in the exercise of the discretionary powers generously conferred by Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000), to <span title="1100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1100">p. 1100</span>“fashion such orders as he or she deems necessary to ensure that each allegation in the complaint is investigated, examined, or checked, to prevent or correct any alleged wrong, and to provide any relief appropriate under such circumstances.”</p>

<p id="fc174ee8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is only on the third issue before us that there is a meritorious argument for relief, as this Court’s Per Curiam opinion recognizes. It is an issue that might well have been dealt with adequately by the Florida courts if the state proceedings had not been interrupted, and if not disposed of at the state level it could have been considered by the Congress in any electoral vote dispute. But because the course of state proceedings has been interrupted, time is short, and the issue is before us, I think it sensible for the Court to address it.</p>
<p id="fc174ee9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners have raised an equal protection claim in the charge that unjustifiably disparate standards are applied in different electoral jurisdictions to otherwise identical facts. It is true that the Equal Protection Clause does not forbid the use of a variety of voting mechanisms within a jurisdiction, even though different mechanisms will have different levels of effectiveness in recording voters’ intentions; local variety can be justified by concerns about cost, the potential value of innovation, and so on. But evidence in the record here suggests that a different order of disparity obtains under rules for determining a voter’s intent that have been applied (and could continue to be applied) to identical types of ballots used in identical brands of machines and exhibiting identical physical characteristics (such as “hanging” or “dimpled” chads). I can conceive of no legitimate state interest served by these differing treatments of the expressions of voters’ fundamental rights. The differences appear wholly arbitrary.</p>
<p id="fc174eea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deciding what to do about this, we should take account of the fact that electoral votes are due to be cast in six days. I would therefore remand the case to the courts of Florida with instructions to establish uniform standards for evaluating the several types of ballots that have prompted differing treatments, to be applied within and among counties when passing on such identical ballots in any further recounting (or successive recounting) that the courts might order.</p>
<p id="fc174eeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the majority, I see no warrant for this Court to assume that Florida could not possibly comply with this requirement before the date set for the meeting of electors, December 18. To recount these manually would be a tall order, but before this Court stayed the effort to do that the courts of Florida were ready to do their best to get that job done. There is no justification for denying the State the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now. I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc1775fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chief Justice acknowledges that provisions of Florida’s Election Code “may well admit of more than one interpretation.” But instead of respecting the state high court’s province to say what the State’s Election Code means, the Chief Justice maintains that Florida’s Supreme Court has veered so far from the ordinary practice of judicial review that what it did cannot properly be called <span title="1101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1101">p. 1101</span>judging. My colleagues have offered a reasonable construction of Florida’s law. Their construction coincides with the view of one of Florida’s seven Supreme Court justices. I might join the Chief Justice were it my commission to interpret Florida law. But disagreement with the Florida court’s interpretation of its own State’s law does not warrant the conclusion that the justices of that court have legislated. There is no cause here to believe that the members of Florida’s high court have done less than “their mortal best to discharge their oath of office,” and no cause to upset their reasoned interpretation of Florida law.</p>
<p id="fc1775ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No doubt there are cases in which the proper application of federal law may hinge on interpretations of state law. Unavoidably, this Court must sometimes examine state law in order to protect federal rights. But we have dealt with such cases ever mindful of the full measure of respect we owe to interpretations of state law by a State’s highest court.</p>
<p id="fc177600-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deferring to state courts on matters of state law, we appropriately recognize that this Court acts as an “‘outside[r]’ lacking the common exposure to local law which comes from sitting in the jurisdiction.” That recognition has sometimes prompted us to resolve doubts about the meaning of state law by certifying issues to a State’s highest court, even when federal rights are at stake. Notwithstanding our authority to decide issues of state law underlying federal claims, we have used the certification device to afford state high courts an opportunity to inform us on matters of their own State’s law because such restraint “helps build a cooperative judicial federalism.” I would have thought the “cautious approach” we counsel when federal courts address matters of state law, and our commitment to “build[ing] cooperative judicial federalism,” demanded greater restraint.</p>
<p id="fc177601-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rarely has this Court rejected outright an interpretation of state law by a state high court. As Justice Breyer convincingly explains, this case involves nothing close to the kind of recalcitrance by a state high court that warrants extraordinary action by this Court. The Florida Supreme Court concluded that counting every legal vote was the overriding concern of the Florida Legislature when it enacted the State’s Election Code. The court surely should not be bracketed with state high courts of the Jim Crow South.</p>
<p id="fc177602-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extraordinary setting of this case has obscured the ordinary principle that dictates its proper resolution: Federal courts defer to state high courts’ interpretations of their state’s own law. This principle reflects the core of federalism, on which all agree. The Chief Justice’s solicitude for the Florida Legislature comes at the expense of the more fundamental solicitude we owe to the legislature’s sovereign. Were the other members of this Court as mindful as they generally are of our system of dual sovereignty, they would affirm the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.</p>

<p id="fc177604-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with Justice Stevens that petitioners have not presented a substantial equal protection claim. Ideally, perfection would be the appropriate standard for judging the recount. But we live in an imperfect world, one in which thousands of votes have not been counted. I cannot agree that the recount adopted by the Florida court, flawed as it may be, would yield a result any less fair or precise than the certification that preceded that recount.</p>
<p id="fc177605-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1102">p. 1102</span>Even if there were an equal protection violation, I would agree with Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer that the Court’s concern about “the December 12 deadline,” is misplaced. Time is short in part because of the Court’s entry of a stay on December 9, several hours after an able circuit judge in Leon County had begun to superintend the recount process. More fundamentally, the Court’s reluctance to let the recount go forward—despite its suggestion that “[t]he search for intent can be confined by specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment[]”—ultimately turns on its own judgment about the practical realities of implementing a recount, not the judgment of those much closer to the process.</p>
<p id="fc177606-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equally important, as Justice Breyer explains, the December 12 “deadline” for bringing Florida’s electoral votes into 3 U.S.C. §5’s safe harbor lacks the significance the Court assigns it. Were that date to pass, Florida would still be entitled to deliver electoral votes Congress must count unless both Houses find that the votes “ha[d] not been . . . regularly given.” 3 U.S.C. §15. The statute identifies other significant dates. See, e.g., §7 (specifying December 18 as the date electors “shall meet and give their votes”); §12 (specifying “the fourth Wednesday in December”—this year, December 27—as the date on which Congress, if it has not received a State’s electoral votes, shall request the state secretary of state to send a certified return immediately). But none of these dates has ultimate significance in light of Congress’s detailed provisions for determining, on “the sixth day of January,” the validity of electoral votes.</p>
<p id="fc177607-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court assumes that time will not permit “orderly judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise.” But no one has doubted the good faith and diligence with which Florida election officials, attorneys for all sides of this controversy, and the courts of law have performed their duties. Notably, the Florida Supreme Court has produced two substantial opinions within 29 hours of oral argument. In sum, the Court’s conclusion that a constitutionally adequate recount is impractical is a prophecy the Court’s own judgment will not allow to be tested. Such an untested prophecy should not decide the Presidency of the United States. I dissent.</p>

<p id="fc179d1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The political implications of this case for the country are momentous. But the federal legal questions presented, with one exception, are insubstantial.</p>
<p id="fc179d1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority raises three Equal Protection problems with the Florida Supreme Court’s recount order: first, the failure to include overvotes in the manual recount; second, the fact that all ballots, rather than simply the undervotes, were recounted in some, but not all, counties; and third, the absence of a uniform, specific standard to guide the recounts. As far as the first issue is concerned, petitioners presented no evidence, to this Court or to any Florida court, that a manual recount of overvotes would identify additional legal votes. <span title="1103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1103">p. 1103</span>The same is true of the second, and, in addition, the majority’s reasoning would seem to invalidate any state provision for a manual recount of individual counties in a statewide election.</p>
<p id="fc179d1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s third concern does implicate principles of fundamental fairness. The majority concludes that the Equal Protection Clause requires that a manual recount be governed not only by the uniform general standard of the “clear intent of the voter,” but also by uniform subsidiary standards (for example, a uniform determination whether indented, but not perforated, “undervotes” should count). The opinion points out that the Florida Supreme Court ordered the inclusion of Broward County’s undercounted “legal votes” even though those votes included ballots that were not perforated but simply “dimpled,” while newly recounted ballots from other counties will likely include only votes determined to be “legal” on the basis of a stricter standard. In light of our previous remand, the Florida Supreme Court may have been reluctant to adopt a more specific standard than that provided for by the legislature for fear of exceeding its authority under Article II. However, since the use of different standards could favor one or the other of the candidates, since time was, and is, too short to permit the lower courts to iron out significant differences through ordinary judicial review, and since the relevant distinction was embodied in the order of the State’s highest court, I agree that, in these very special circumstances, basic principles of fairness may well have counseled the adoption of a uniform standard to address the problem. In light of the majority’s disposition, I need not decide whether, or the extent to which, as a remedial matter, the Constitution would place limits upon the content of the uniform standard.</p>
<p id="fc179d1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, there is no justification for the majority’s remedy, which is simply to reverse the lower court and halt the recount entirely. An appropriate remedy would be, instead, to remand this case with instructions that, even at this late date, would permit the Florida Supreme Court to require recounting all under-counted votes in Florida, including those from Broward, Volusia, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade Counties, whether or not previously recounted prior to the end of the protest period, and to do so in accordance with a single-uniform substandard.</p>
<p id="fc179d1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority justifies stopping the recount entirely on the ground that there is no more time. In particular, the majority relies on the lack of time for the Secretary to review and approve equipment needed to separate undervotes. But the majority reaches this conclusion in the absence of any record evidence that the recount could not have been completed in the time allowed by the Florida Supreme Court. The majority finds facts outside of the record on matters that state courts are in a far better position to address. Of course, it is too late for any such recount to take place by December 12, the date by which election disputes must be decided if a State is to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of 3 U.S.C. §5. Whether there is time to conduct a recount prior to December 18, when the electors are scheduled to meet, is a matter for the state courts to determine. And whether, under Florida law, Florida could or could not take further action is obviously a matter for Florida courts, not this Court, to decide.</p>
<p id="fc179d20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By halting the manual recount, and thus ensuring that the uncounted legal votes will not be counted under any standard, this Court crafts a remedy out of proportion to the asserted harm. And that remedy harms the very fairness interests the Court is attempting to protect. The manual recount would itself redress a problem of unequal treatment of ballots. As Justice Stevens points out, the <span title="1104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1104">p. 1104</span>ballots of voters in counties that use punch-card systems are more likely to be disqualified than those in counties using optical-scanning systems. According to recent news reports, variations in the undervote rate are even more pronounced. See Fessenden, No-Vote Rates Higher in Punch Card Count, N.Y. Times, Dec. 1, 2000, p. A29 (reporting that 0.3% of ballots cast in 30 Florida counties using optical-scanning systems registered no Presidential vote, in comparison to 1.53% in the 15 counties using Votomatic punch card ballots). Thus, in a system that allows counties to use different types of voting systems, voters already arrive at the polls with an unequal chance that their votes will be counted. I do not see how the fact that this results from counties’ selection of different voting machines rather than a court order makes the outcome any more fair. Nor do I understand why the Florida Supreme Court’s recount order, which helps to redress this inequity, must be entirely prohibited based on a deficiency that could easily be remedied.</p>

<p id="fc179d22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the reminder that this case involves “an election for the President of the United States,” no preeminent legal concern, or practical concern related to legal questions, required this Court to hear this case, let alone to issue a stay that stopped Florida’s recount process in its tracks. With one exception, petitioners’ claims do not ask us to vindicate a constitutional provision designed to protect a basic human right. Petitioners invoke fundamental fairness, namely, the need for procedural fairness, including finality. But with the one “equal protection” exception, they rely upon law that focuses, not upon that basic need, but upon the constitutional allocation of power. Respondents invoke a competing fundamental consideration—the need to determine the voter’s true intent. But they look to state law, not to federal constitutional law, to protect that interest. Neither side claims electoral fraud, dishonesty, or the like. And the more fundamental equal protection claim might have been left to the state court to resolve if and when it was discovered to have mattered. It could still be resolved through a remand conditioned upon issuance of a uniform standard; it does not require reversing the Florida Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fc179d23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the selection of the President is of fundamental national importance. But that importance is political, not legal. And this Court should resist the temptation unnecessarily to resolve tangential legal disputes, where doing so threatens to determine the outcome of the election.</p>
<p id="fc179d24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution and federal statutes themselves make clear that restraint is appropriate. They set forth a road map of how to resolve disputes about electors, even after an election as close as this one. That road map foresees resolution of electoral disputes by state courts. But it nowhere provides for involvement by the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fc179d25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the contrary, the Twelfth Amendment commits to Congress the authority and responsibility to count electoral votes. A federal statute, the Electoral Count Act, enacted after the close 1876 Hayes-Tilden Presidential election, specifies that, after States have tried to resolve disputes (through “judicial” or other means), Congress is the body primarily authorized to resolve remaining disputes. The legislative history of the Act makes clear its intent to commit the power to resolve such disputes to Congress, rather than the courts.</p>
<p id="fc179d26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1105" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1105">p. 1105</span>Those who caution judicial restraint in resolving political disputes have described the quintessential case for that restraint as a case marked, among other things, by the “strangeness of the issue,” its “intractability to principled resolution,” its “sheer momentousness, . . . which tends to unbalance judicial judgment,” and “the inner vulnerability, the self-doubt of an institution which is electorally irresponsible and has no earth to draw strength from.” Alexander Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch (1962). Those characteristics mark this case.</p>
<p id="fc179d27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, as I have said, the Court is not acting to vindicate a fundamental constitutional principle, such as the need to protect a basic human liberty. No other strong reason to act is present. Congressional statutes tend to obviate the need. And, above all, in this highly politicized matter, the appearance of a split decision runs the risk of undermining the public’s confidence in the Court itself. That confidence is a public treasure. It has been built slowly over many years, some of which were marked by a Civil War and the tragedy of segregation. It is a vitally necessary ingredient of any successful effort to protect basic liberty and, indeed, the rule of law itself. We run no risk of returning to the days when a President (responding to this Court’s efforts to protect the Cherokee Indians) might have said, “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!” But we do risk a self-inflicted wound—a wound that may harm not just the Court, but the Nation.</p>
<p id="fc179d28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I fear that in order to bring this agonizingly long election process to a definitive conclusion, we have not adequately attended to that necessary “check upon our own exercise of power,” “our own sense of self-restraint.” United States v. Butler (1936) (Stone, J., dissenting). Justice Brandeis once said of the Court, “The most important thing we do is not doing.” What it does today, the Court should have left undone. I would repair the damage done as best we now can, by permitting the Florida recount to continue under uniform standards. I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc179d2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many issues to consider regarding Bush v. Gore. First, was the case justiciable? Gore did not raise justiciability issues in his briefs or at oral argument. Yet justiciability is jurisdictional; the Court must raise it on its own. The question is whether Bush had standing to raise the equal protection claims of the Florida voters. Also, was the case ripe for review at the time it was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court? Should the Court have found that the matter was a political question and left it to Congress to resolve?</p>
<p id="fc179d2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, was the Court correct in finding a denial of equal protection? Seven of the justices expressed concern over a denial of equal protection from counting votes without uniform standards. However, it is notable that Justices Souter and Breyer, who shared this concern with the majority, did not file opinions “concurring in part and dissenting in part” but rather just dissented. How, exactly, was equal protection denied?</p>
<p id="fc179d2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, was the Court justified in ending the counting in Florida? The Court, in its <i>per curiam</i> opinion, said that the Florida Supreme Court had indicated that it wanted to follow the December 12 deadline set by the federal “safe harbor” statute. Because it was December 12, the Supreme Court ordered an end to the counting. But because it was an issue of Florida state law, should the Supreme <span title="1106" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1106">p. 1106</span>Court have remanded the case for the Florida Supreme Court to decide the content of Florida law under the unprecedented circumstances?</p>
<p id="fc179d2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 13, 2000, the day after Bush v. Gore was decided, Al Gore conceded the election to George W. Bush. Rightly or wrongly, for the first time in history, the Supreme Court decided a presidential election.</p>

<p id="fc17c341-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has spoken of “the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1229E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1229E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">45</a></span> The Court long has said that the right to be heard in court is an essential aspect of due process. For example, in Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274 (1876), the Court spoke of the right to be heard as a principle that “lies at the foundation of all well-ordered systems of jurisprudence” and is “founded in the first principles of natural justice.”</p>
<p id="fc17c343-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, the Court has held that discrimination among people as to access to the courts is subjected to strict scrutiny under equal protection. The Court has quoted the Magna Charta, “To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse, or delay, right or justice. . . . No free man shall be taken or imprisoned, . . . but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN122A8_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N122A8_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">46</a></span> The Court has said that “[i]n this tradition, our own constitutional guaranties of due process and equal protection both call for procedures in criminal trials which allow no invidious discriminations between persons and different groups of persons.”</p>
<p id="fc17c345-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Access to the courts also is protected by specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights, most notably by the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of the right to counsel in criminal cases. In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), the Supreme Court held that this right applies to the state and subsequently the Court clarified that states are constitutionally required to provide indigent defendants an attorney in all criminal cases where there is a punishment of imprisonment. In <i>Gideon</i>, the Court forcefully declared that “reason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.”</p>
<p id="fc17c346-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the Court has held that wealth inequalities with regard to the appellate process unconstitutionally violate the right of access to the courts. Neither the text of the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights mentions a right to appeal. Nor has the Supreme Court held that due process requires appellate review of criminal convictions or civil judgments.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN122B9_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N122B9_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">47</a></span> But the Court has ruled that when appeals are made available, the government cannot discriminate or create barriers that limit the ability of indigents to exercise this right. In Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), the Supreme Court concluded that the government <span title="1107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1107">p. 1107</span>must provide transcripts on appeal for indigent criminal defendants. Illinois law created a right to appeal criminal convictions, but direct appellate review was available only if the defendant provided the appellate court with a bill of exceptions or a report of the trial proceedings certified by the trial judge. It sometimes was impossible to prepare such documents without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings. Under state law these were provided free of charge only to defendants who had been sentenced to death. <i>Griffin</i> involved a defendant who had been sentenced for armed robbery and was kept from appealing solely because he lacked the funds to pay for a transcript.</p>
<p id="fc17c348-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court did not hold that there is a constitutional right to appeal, but did say that if state law creates such a right, the state may not “den[y] the poor an adequate appellate review accorded to all who have enough money to pay the costs in advance.” The Court concluded that the state must purchase a stenographic transcript if the defendant could not afford one.</p>
<p id="fc17c349-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also has found that the government must provide a free attorney to indigent defendants for their appeals, but the Court has limited this to first appeals where courts must review the case and has not extended the right to second, discretionary appeals or to collateral attacks on convictions. In Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963), decided the same day as Gideon v. Wainwright, the Court ruled that the government must provide indigent criminal defendants free counsel on appeal, at least for their initial appeal, which state law requires the courts of appeals to hear. The Court explained, “There is lacking that equality demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment where the rich man, who appeals as of right, enjoys the benefit of counsel’s examination into the record, research of the law, and marshalling of arguments on his behalf, while the indigent, already burdened by a preliminary declaration that his case is without merit, is forced to shift for himself. The indigent, where the record is unclear or the errors are hidden, has only the right to a meaningless ritual, while the rich man has a meaningful appeal.”</p>
<p id="fc17c34a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Court subsequently limited this right to initial appeals that are created as a matter of right by state law; that is, appeals that state appellate courts are obligated to hear and decide. In Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600 (1974), the Court held that the government is not required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant’s discretionary appeal to the highest state court or to the U.S. Supreme Court. <i>Ross</i> involved a criminal defendant who was provided with an attorney for his initial appeal to the state court of appeals, but was denied an attorney to seek discretionary review in the North Carolina Supreme Court or to file a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fc17c34b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court acknowledged that the lack of an attorney is a significant disadvantage in seeking such review, but it nonetheless found no constitutional violation in the government’s refusing to pay for a lawyer at these stages for indigent defendants. The Court explained, “The duty of the State under our cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of State’s appellate process. We think respondent was given that opportunity under the existing North Carolina system.”</p>
<p id="fc17c34c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the Court has held that the government is not required to provide free counsel to indigent defendants to bring collateral attacks on their convictions, such as through writs of habeas corpus. In Pennsylvania v. Finley, <span title="1108" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1108">p. 1108</span>481 U.S. 551 (1987), the Court said, “We have never held that prisoners have a constitutional right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon their convictions and we decline to so hold today. Our cases establish that the right to appointed counsel extends to the first appeal as of right, and no further.” In Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court went even further and held that the government is not required to provide indigent defendants sentenced to death with free counsel to pursue collateral attacks on their convictions and sentences. The Court reiterated that the government has the constitutional duty to provide counsel to indigent defendants only for their first appeal as of right and not for discretionary appeals or for collateral attacks. The Court expressly rejected the argument that a defendant facing a death sentence is entitled to special protection on appeal.</p>
<p id="fc17c34d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two important areas in which the Court has considered the right of access to the courts are the constitutionality of filing fees and the ability of prisoners to use the judicial process.</p>


<div id="fc17c34e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc17c34f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>FILING FEES</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fc17c350-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite strong statements of a right of equal access to the courts for rich and poor, the Court has been very inconsistent as to whether the government is constitutionally obligated to waive filing fees for indigent individuals in civil proceedings. In fact, generally, the Court has refused to find that filing fees impermissibly violate equal protection or due process. The leading case that found a filing fee requirement unconstitutional is Boddie v. Connecticut.</p>

<p id="fc17ea66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Harlan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc17ea67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, welfare recipients residing in the State of Connecticut, brought this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, challenging, as applied to them, certain state procedures for the commencement of litigation, including requirements for payment of court fees and costs for service of process, that restrict their access to the courts in their effort to bring an action for divorce.</p>
<p id="fc17ea68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears from the briefs and oral argument that the average cost to a litigant for bringing an action for divorce is $60. There is no dispute as to the inability of the named appellants in the present case to pay either the court fees required by statute or the cost incurred for the service of process. The affidavits in the record establish that appellants’ welfare income in each instance barely suffices to meet the costs of the daily essentials of life and includes no allotment that could be budgeted for the expense to gain access to the courts in order to obtain a divorce. Also undisputed is appellants’ “good faith” in seeking a divorce.</p>
<p id="fc17ea69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion is that, given the basic position of the marriage relationship in this society’s hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process does prohibit a State from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who seek judicial dissolution of their marriages.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1109" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1109">p. 1109</span>As this Court on more than one occasion has recognized, marriage involves interests of basic importance in our society. See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia (1967). It is not surprising, then, that the States have seen fit to oversee many aspects of that institution. Without a prior judicial imprimatur, individuals may freely enter into and rescind commercial contracts, for example, but we are unaware of any jurisdiction where private citizens may covenant for or dissolve marriages without state approval. Even where all substantive requirements are concededly met, we know of no instance where two consenting adults may divorce and mutually liberate themselves from the constraints of legal obligations that go with marriage, and more fundamentally the prohibition against remarriage, without invoking the State’s judicial machinery.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, although they assert here due process rights as would-be plaintiffs, we think appellants’ plight, because resort to the state courts is the only avenue to dissolution of their marriages, is akin to that of defendants faced with exclusion from the only forum effectively empowered to settle their disputes. Resort to the judicial process by these plaintiffs is no more voluntary in a realistic sense than that of the defendant called upon to defend his interests in court. For both groups this process is not only the paramount dispute-settlement technique, but, in fact, the only available one. In this posture we think that this appeal is properly to be resolved in light of the principles enunciated in our due process decisions that delimit rights of defendants compelled to litigate their differences in the judicial forum.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These due process decisions, representing over a hundred years of effort by this Court to give concrete embodiment to this concept, provide, we think, complete vindication for appellants’ contentions. Prior cases establish that due process requires, at a minimum, that absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Drawing upon [this] principle, we conclude that the State’s refusal to admit these appellants to its courts, the sole means in Connecticut for obtaining a divorce, must be regarded as the equivalent of denying them an opportunity to be heard upon their claimed right to a dissolution of their marriages, and, in the absence of a sufficient countervailing justification for the State’s action, a denial of due process.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The arguments for this kind of fee and cost requirement are that the State’s interest in the prevention of frivolous litigation is substantial, its use of court fees and process costs to allocate scarce resources is rational, and its balance between the defendant’s right to notice and the plaintiff’s right to access is reasonable. In our opinion, none of these considerations is sufficient to override the interest of these plaintiff-appellants in having access to the only avenue open for dissolving their allegedly untenable marriages. Not only is there no necessary connection between a litigant’s assets and the seriousness of his motives in bringing suit, but it is here beyond present dispute that appellants bring these actions in good faith. Moreover, other alternatives exist to fees and cost requirements as a means for conserving the time of courts and protecting parties from frivolous litigation, such as penalties for false pleadings or affidavits, and actions for malicious prosecution or abuse of process, to mention only a few. In the same vein we think that reliable alternatives exist to service of process by a state-paid sheriff if the State is unwilling to assume the cost of official service. This is perforce true of service by publication which is the method of notice least <span title="1110" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1110">p. 1110</span>calculated to bring to a potential defendant’s attention the pendency of judicial proceedings. We think in this case service at defendant’s last known address by mail and posted notice is equally effective as publication in a newspaper.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are thus left to evaluate the State’s asserted interest in its fee and cost requirements as a mechanism of resource allocation or cost recoupment. Such a justification was offered and rejected in Griffin v. Illinois (1956). In <i>Griffin</i> it was the requirement of a transcript beyond the means of the indigent that blocked access to the judicial process. While in <i>Griffin</i> the transcript could be waived as a convenient but not necessary predicate to court access, here the State invariably imposes the costs as a measure of allocating its judicial resources. Surely, then, the rationale of <i>Griffin</i> covers this case.</p>
<p id="fc17ea6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In concluding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that these appellants be afforded an opportunity to go into court to obtain a divorce, we wish to re-emphasize that we go no further than necessary to dispose of the case before us, a case where the bona fides of both appellants’ indigency and desire for divorce are here beyond dispute. We do not decide that access for all individuals to the courts is a right that is, in all circumstances, guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that its exercise may not be placed beyond the reach of any individual, for, as we have already noted, in the case before us this right is the exclusive precondition to the adjustment of a fundamental human relationship. The requirement that these appellants resort to the judicial process is entirely a state-created matter. Thus we hold only that a State may not, consistent with the obligations imposed on it by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pre-empt the right to dissolve this legal relationship without affording all citizens access to the means it has prescribed for doing so.</p>

<p id="fc17ea71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a strange case and a strange holding. Absent some specific federal constitutional or statutory provision, marriage in this country is completely under state control, and so is divorce. When the first settlers arrived here the power to grant divorces in Great Britain was not vested in that country’s courts but in its Parliament. And as recently as 1888 this Court, in Maynard v. Hill, upheld a divorce granted by the Legislature of the Territory of Oregon. Since that time the power of state legislatures to grant divorces or vest that power in their courts seems not to have been questioned. It is not by accident that marriage and divorce have always been considered to be under state control. The institution of marriage is of peculiar importance to the people of the States. It is within the States that they live and vote and rear their children under laws passed by their elected representatives. The States provide for the stability of their social order, for the good morals of all their citizens, and for the needs of children from broken homes. The States, therefore, have particular interests in the kinds of laws regulating their citizens when they enter into, maintain, and dissolve marriages. The power of the States over marriage and divorce is complete except as limited by specific constitutional provisions.</p>
<p id="fc17ea72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court here holds, however, that the State of Connecticut has so little control over marriages and divorces of its own citizens that it is without power to charge them practically nominal initial court costs when they are without ready money to put up those costs. The Court holds that the state law requiring payment of costs is barred by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth <span title="1111" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1111">p. 1111</span>Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Two members of the majority believe that the Equal Protection Clause also applies. I think the Connecticut court costs law is barred by neither of those clauses.</p>
<p id="fc17ea73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Civil lawsuits are not like government prosecutions for crime. Civil courts are set up by government to give people who have quarrels with their neighbors the chance to use a neutral governmental agency to adjust their differences. In such cases the government is not usually involved as a party, and there is no deprivation of life, liberty, or property as punishment for crime. Our Federal Constitution, therefore, does not place such private disputes on the same high level as it places criminal trials and punishment. There is consequently no necessity, no reason, why government should in civil trials be hampered or handicapped by the strict and rigid due process rules the Constitution has provided to protect people charged with crime.</p>
<p id="fc181184-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One more thought about the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses: neither, in my judgment, justifies judges in trying to make our Constitution fit the times, or hold laws constitutional or not on the basis of a judge’s sense of fairness. The rules set out in the Constitution itself provide what is governmentally fair and what is not. Neither due process nor equal protection permits state laws to be invalidated on any such nonconstitutional standard as a judge’s personal view of fairness. The people and their elected representatives, not judges, are constitutionally vested with the power to amend the Constitution. Judges should not usurp that power in order to put over their own views.</p>
<p id="fc181185-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in subsequent cases not involving constitutional rights, the Court refused to extend <i>Boddie</i> to require a waiver of filing fees in other civil proceedings. Compare United States v. Kras, and consider whether the Court’s distinctions of <i>Boddie</i> are persuasive.</p>

<p id="fc18118c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bankruptcy Act and one of this Court’s complementary Orders in Bankruptcy impose fees and make the payment of those fees a condition to a discharge in voluntary bankruptcy. Appellee Kras, an indigent petitioner in bankruptcy, challenged the fees on Fifth Amendment grounds.</p>
<p id="fc18118d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Robert William Kras presented his voluntary petition in bankruptcy to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on May 28, 1971. The petition was accompanied by Kras’ motion for leave to file and proceed in bankruptcy without payment of any of the filing fees as a condition precedent to discharge. The motion was supported by Kras’ affidavit containing the following allegations that have not been controverted by the Government:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="fc18118e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kras resides in a 2½-room apartment with his wife, two children, ages 5 years and 8 months, his mother, and his mother’s 6-year-old daughter. His younger child suffers from cystic fibrosis and is undergoing treatment in a medical center.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fc18118f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kras has been unemployed since May 1969 except for odd jobs producing about $300 in 1969 and a like amount in 1970. His last steady job was as an insurance agent with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. <span title="1112" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1112">p. 1112</span>He was discharged by Metropolitan in 1969 when premiums he had collected were stolen from his home and he was unable to make up the amount to his employer. Metropolitan’s claim against him has increased to over $1,000 and is one of the debts listed in his bankruptcy petition. He has diligently sought steady employment in New York City, but, because of unfavorable references from Metropolitan, he has been unsuccessful. Mrs. Kras was employed until March 1970, when she was forced to stop because of pregnancy. All her attention now will be devoted to caring for the younger child who is coming out of the hospital soon.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fc181190-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Kras household subsists entirely on $210 per month public assistance received for Kras’ own family and $156 per month public assistance received for his mother and her daughter. These benefits are all expended for rent and day-to-day necessities. The rent is $102 per month. Kras owns no automobile and no asset that is non-exempt under the bankruptcy law. He receives no unemployment or disability benefit. His sole assets are wearing apparel and $50 worth of essential household goods. He has a couch of negligible value in storage on which a $6 payment is due monthly.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fc181191-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of his poverty, Kras is wholly unable to pay or promise to pay the bankruptcy fees, even in small installments. He has been unable to borrow money. The New York City Department of Social Services refuses to allot money for payment of the fees. He has no prospect of immediate employment.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fc181192-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kras seeks a discharge in bankruptcy of $6,428.69 in total indebtedness in order to relieve himself and his family of the distress of financial insolvency and creditor harassment and in order to make a new start in life. It is especially important that he obtain a discharge of his debt to Metropolitan soon “because until that is cleared up Metropolitan will continue to falsely charge me with fraud and give me bad references which prevent my getting employment.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="fc181193-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kras contends that his case falls squarely within <i>Boddie.</i> The Government, on the other hand, stresses the differences between divorce (with which <i>Boddie</i> was concerned) and bankruptcy, and claims that <i>Boddie</i> is not controlling and that the fee requirements constitute a reasonable exercise of Congress’s plenary power over bankruptcy.</p>
<p id="fc181194-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Government that our decision in <i>Boddie</i> does not control the disposition of this case and that the District Court’s reliance upon <i>Boddie</i> is misplaced.</p>
<p id="fc181195-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A. <i>Boddie</i> was based on the notion that a State cannot deny access, simply because of one’s poverty, to a “judicial proceeding [that is] the only effective means of resolving the dispute at hand.” Throughout the opinion there is constant and recurring reference to Connecticut’s exclusive control over the establishment, enforcement, and dissolution of the marital relationship. The Court emphasized that “marriage involves interests of basic importance in our society,” and spoke of “state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship.” “[R]esort to the state courts [was] the only avenue to dissolution of . . . marriages,” which was “not only the paramount dispute-settlement technique, but, in fact, the only available one.” The Court acknowledged that <span title="1113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1113">p. 1113</span>it knew “of no instance where two consenting adults may divorce and mutually liberate themselves from the constraints of legal obligations that go with marriage, and more fundamentally the prohibition against remarriage, without invoking the State’s judicial machinery.” In the light of all this, we concluded that resort to the judicial process was “no more voluntary in a realistic sense than that of the defendant called upon to defend his interests in court” and we resolved the case “in light of the principles enunciated in our due process decisions that delimit rights of defendants compelled to litigate their differences in the judicial forum.”</p>
<p id="fc181196-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">B. The appellants in <i>Boddie</i>, on the one hand, and Robert Kras, on the other, stand in materially different postures. The denial of access to the judicial forum in <i>Boddie</i> touched directly, as has been noted, on the marital relationship and on the associational interests that surround the establishment and dissolution of that relationship. On many occasions we have recognized the fundamental importance of these interests under our Constitution. The <i>Boddie</i> appellants’ inability to dissolve their marriages seriously impaired their freedom to pursue other protected associational activities. Kras’ alleged interest in the elimination of his debt burden, and in obtaining his desired new start in life, although important and so recognized by the enactment of the Bankruptcy Act, does not rise to the same constitutional level. If Kras is not discharged in bankruptcy, his position will not be materially altered in any constitutional sense. Gaining or not gaining a discharge will effect no change with respect to basic necessities. We see no fundamental interest that is gained or lost depending on the availability of a discharge in bankruptcy.</p>
<p id="fc1838a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">C. Nor is the Government’s control over the establishment, enforcement, or dissolution of debts nearly so exclusive as Connecticut’s control over the marriage relationship in <i>Boddie.</i> In contrast with divorce, bankruptcy is not the only method available to a debtor for the adjustment of his legal relationship with his creditors. The utter exclusiveness of court access and court remedy, as has been noted, was a potent factor in <i>Boddie.</i> But “[w]ithout a prior judicial imprimatur, individuals may freely enter into and rescind commercial contracts. . . .”</p>
<p id="fc1838a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However unrealistic the remedy may be in a particular situation, a debtor, in theory, and often in actuality, may adjust his debts by negotiated agreement with his creditors. At times the happy passage of the applicable limitation period, or other acceptable creditor arrangement, will provide the answer. Government’s role with respect to the private commercial relationship is qualitatively and quantitatively different from its role in the establishment, enforcement, and dissolution of marriage. Resort to the court, therefore, is not Kras’ sole path to relief. <i>Boddie</i>’s emphasis on exclusivity finds no counterpart in the bankrupt’s situation.</p>
<p id="fc1838a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[D.] There is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one’s debts in bankruptcy. The Constitution, Art. I, §8, cl. 4, merely authorizes the Congress to “establish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” The rational basis for the fee requirement is readily apparent. Congressional power over bankruptcy, of course, is plenary and exclusive.</p>
<p id="fc1838aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[E.] If the $50 filing fees are paid in installments over six months as General Order No. 35(4) permits on a proper showing, the required average weekly payment is $1.92. If the payment period is extended for the additional three months as the Order permits, the average weekly payment is lowered to $1.28. <span title="1114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1114">p. 1114</span>This is a sum less than the payments Kras makes on his couch of negligible value in storage, and less than the price of a movie and little more than the cost of a pack or two of cigarettes. If, as Kras alleges in his affidavit, a discharge in bankruptcy will afford him that new start he so desires, and the Metropolitan then no longer will charge him with fraud and give him bad references, and if he really needs and desires that discharge, this much available revenue should be within his able-bodied reach when the adjudication in bankruptcy has stayed collection and has brought to a halt whatever harassment, if any, he may have sustained from creditors.</p>
<p id="fc1838ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We decline to extend the principle of <i>Boddie</i> to the no-asset bankruptcy proceeding. That relief, if it is to be forthcoming, should originate with Congress.</p>
<p id="fc1838ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart,</span> with whom Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas,</span> Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> and Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc1838ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 28, 1971, Robert Kras, the appellee, sought to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. In an accompanying affidavit, he described his economic plight. He resided in a 2½-room apartment with his wife, his two young children, his mother, and her child. His eight-month-old son had cystic fibrosis and at the time of the affidavit was undergoing hospital treatment. Unemployed since May 1969, except for odd jobs, he supported his household on a total public assistance allotment of $366 per month—all of which was consumed on rent and the most basic necessities of life. His sole assets consisted of $50 worth of clothing and essential household goods.</p>
<p id="fc1838ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Boddie</i> held that a Connecticut statute requiring the payment of an average $60 fee as a prerequisite to a divorce action was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to indigents unable to pay the fee. The violation of due process seems to me equally clear in the present case. It is undisputed that Kras is making a good-faith attempt to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy, and that he is in fact indigent. As was true in <i>Boddie</i>, the “welfare income . . . barely suffices to meet the costs of the daily essentials of life and includes no allotment that could be budgeted for the expense to gain access to the courts. . . .”</p>
<p id="fc1838af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the debtor, like the married plaintiffs in <i>Boddie</i>, originally entered into his contract freely and voluntarily. But it is the Government nevertheless that continues to enforce that obligation, and under our “legal system” that debt is effective only because the judicial machinery is there to collect it. The bankrupt is bankrupt precisely for the reason that the State stands ready to exact all of his debts through garnishment, attachment, and the panoply of other creditor remedies. The appellee can be pursued and harassed by his creditors since they hold his legally enforceable debts.</p>
<p id="fc1838b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And in the unique situation of the indigent bankrupt, the Government provides the only effective means of his ever being free of these Government-imposed obligations. As in <i>Boddie</i>, there are no “recognized, effective alternatives.” While the creditors of a bankrupt with assets might well desire to reach a compromise settlement, that possibility is foreclosed to the truly indigent bankrupt. With no funds and not even a sufficient prospect of income to be able to promise the payment of a $50 fee in weekly installments of $1.28, the assetless bankrupt has absolutely nothing to offer his creditors. And his creditors have nothing to gain by allowing him to escape or reduce his debts; their only hope is that eventually he might make enough income for them to attach. Unless the <span title="1115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1115">p. 1115</span>Government provides him access to the bankruptcy court, Kras will remain in the totally hopeless situation he now finds himself. The Government has thus truly pre-empted the only means for the indigent bankrupt to get out from under a lifetime burden of debt.</p>
<p id="fc1838b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc1838b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent of Justice Stewart, in which I have joined, makes clear the majority’s failure to distinguish this case from Boddie v. Connecticut (1971). I add only some comments on the extraordinary route by which the majority reaches its conclusion.</p>
<p id="fc1838b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority notes that the minimum amount that appellee Kras must pay each week if he is permitted to pay the filing fees in installments is only $1.28. It says that “this much available revenue should be within his able-bodied reach.” Appellee submitted an affidavit in which he claimed that he was “unable to pay or promise to pay the filing fees, even in small installments.” This claim was supported by detailed statements of his financial condition.</p>
<p id="fc1838b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I cannot agree with the majority that it is so easy for the desperately poor to save $1.92 each week over the course of six months. The 1970 Census found that over 800,000 families in the Nation had annual incomes of less than $1,000 or $19.23 a week. I see no reason to require that families in such straits sacrifice over 5% of their annual income as a prerequisite to getting a discharge in bankruptcy.</p>
<p id="fc1838b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be easy for some people to think that weekly savings of less than $2 are no burden. But no one who has had close contact with poor people can fail to understand how close to the margin of survival many of them are. A sudden illness, for example, may destroy whatever savings they may have accumulated, and by eliminating a sense of security may destroy the incentive to save in the future. A pack or two of cigarettes may be, for them, not a routine purchase but a luxury indulged in only rarely. The desperately poor almost never go to see a movie, which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly activity. They have more important things to do with what little money they have—like attempting to provide some comforts for a gravely ill child, as Kras must do.</p>
<p id="fc1838b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is perfectly proper for judges to disagree about what the Constitution requires. But it is disgraceful for an interpretation of the Constitution to be premised upon unfounded assumptions about how people live.</p>

<p id="fc1838b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Ortwein v. Schwab, 410 U.S. 656 (1973), the Court followed the reasoning in <i>Kras</i> and held that the government was not obligated to waive filing fees for judicial review of adverse welfare decisions. An individual sought judicial review of a reduction in his welfare benefits, but he could not afford the $25 filing fee. The Supreme Court found no violation of due process or equal protection in precluding judicial review because of the inability to pay the fee. The Court relied on <i>Kras</i> and again distinguished <i>Boddie</i> on the ground that a denial or reduction in welfare benefits did not implicate constitutional rights. Interestingly, in <i>Ortwein</i>, as in <i>Boddie</i>, the state had a monopoly for resolving disputes: Only judicial review could reverse the denial of welfare benefits. Nonetheless, the Court found no constitutional violation in denying judicial review because of an inability to pay the filing fee.</p>
<p id="fc1838b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1116">p. 1116</span>Although <i>Boddie</i> and <i>Ortwein</i> make it very difficult to challenge filing fee requirements, it is still possible in areas where fundamental rights are at issue and where the state has a monopoly in providing redress. In M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102 (1996), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state requirement that parents pay a fee for preparation of the trial record in order to appeal a termination of custody. A Mississippi court entered an order permanently terminating a mother’s custody of her child. The mother sought to appeal from the termination decree, but Mississippi required that she pay in advance record preparation fees estimated at $2,352.36. Because she lacked funds to pay the fees, her appeal was dismissed.</p>
<p id="fc185fc9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, found this unconstitutional. Justice Ginsburg began by stressing the fundamental rights involved: “Choices about marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children are among associational rights this Court has ranked as ‘of basic importance in our society,’ rights sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State’s unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.”</p>
<p id="fc185fca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court noted that access to the courts, as reflected in prior decisions, embodied “both equal protection and due process concerns.” The Court said that generally access fees only have to meet rational basis review but that there is an exception in that “access to judicial processes in cases criminal or ‘quasi criminal in nature,’ [may not] turn on ability to pay.” The Court said that proceedings to permanently terminate parental custody fit into the latter category because “termination adjudications involve the awesome authority of the State ‘to destroy permanently all legal recognition of the parental relationship.’” Thus, the imposition of costs for the record preparation was declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fc185fcd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One area where, until recently, the Court has been protective of a right of access to the courts is for prisoners. In Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546 (1941), the Court said that “the state and its officers may not abridge or impair petitioner’s right to apply to a federal court for a writ of habeas corpus.” In <i>Hull</i>, the Court declared unconstitutional actions by prison officials in repeatedly seizing and destroying habeas corpus petitions prepared by a prison inmate.</p>
<p id="fc185fce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state prison regulation that provided that no inmate could advise or assist another inmate in preparing writs or giving legal assistance. The Court said that unless the state provides reasonable alternatives in assisting inmates with post-conviction proceedings, it may not enforce a regulation that bars inmates from assisting other prisoners. The Court said that because “the basic purpose of the writ is to enable those unlawfully incarcerated to obtain their freedom, it is fundamental that access of prisoners to the courts for the purpose of presenting their complaints may not be denied or obstructed.”</p>
<p id="fc185fcf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court followed this reasoning in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974), and declared unconstitutional a prison regulation that prevented law students and paralegals from conducting attorney-client interviews with clients. The Court said that “[t]he constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that prisoners be afforded access to the courts <span title="1117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1117">p. 1117</span>in order to challenge unlawful convictions and to seek redress for violations of their opportunity to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys.” The Court concluded that the state had no interest in barring all law students and paralegals from the prison.</p>
<p id="fc185fd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), the Court extended this reasoning and held that prisons were obligated to provide law library facilities and appropriate supplies to inmates. <i>Bounds</i> is particularly important because of its declaration of a fundamental right of access to the courts and its protection of this for prisoners.</p>

<p id="fc185fd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BOUNDS v. SMITH, 430 U.S. 817 (1977): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc185fd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue in this case is whether States must protect the right of prisoners to access to the courts by providing them with law libraries or alternative sources of legal knowledge. Respondents are inmates incarcerated in correctional facilities of the Division of Prisons of the North Carolina Department of Correction. Respondents alleged, in pertinent part, that they were denied access to the courts in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights by the State’s failure to provide legal research facilities.</p>
<p id="fc185fd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts. More recent decisions have struck down restrictions and required remedial measures to insure that inmate access to the courts is adequate, effective, and meaningful. Moreover, our decisions have consistently required States to shoulder affirmative obligations to assure all prisoners meaningful access to the courts. It is indisputable that indigent inmates must be provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them. States must forgo collection of docket fees otherwise payable to the treasury and expend funds for transcripts. State expenditures are necessary to pay lawyers for indigent defendants at trial, Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), and in appeals as of right, Douglas v. California (1963). This is not to say that economic factors may not be considered, for example, in choosing the methods used to provide meaningful access. But the cost of protecting a constitutional right cannot justify its total denial. Thus, neither the availability of jailhouse lawyers nor the necessity for affirmative state action is dispositive of respondents’ claims. The inquiry is rather whether law libraries or other forms of legal assistance are needed to give prisoners a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.</p>
<p id="fc185fd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it is essentially true, as petitioners argue, that a habeas corpus petition or civil rights complaint need only set forth facts giving rise to the cause of action, it hardly follows that a law library or other legal assistance is not essential to frame such documents. It would verge on incompetence for a lawyer to file an initial pleading without researching such issues as jurisdiction, venue, standing, exhaustion of remedies, proper parties plaintiff and defendant, and types of relief available. Most importantly, of course, a lawyer must know what the law is in order to determine whether a colorable claim exists, and if so, what facts are necessary to state a cause of action.</p>
<p id="fc185fd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a lawyer must perform such preliminary research, it is no less vital for a pro se prisoner. Indeed, despite the “less stringent standards” by which a pro <span title="1118" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1118">p. 1118</span>se pleading is judged, it is often more important that a prisoner complaint set forth a nonfrivolous claim meeting all procedural prerequisites, since the court may pass on the complaint’s sufficiency before allowing filing in forma pauperis and may dismiss the case if it is deemed frivolous. Moreover, if the State files a response to a pro se pleading, it will undoubtedly contain seemingly authoritative citations. Without a library, an inmate will be unable to rebut the State’s argument. It is not enough to answer that the court will evaluate the facts pleaded in light of the relevant law. Even the most dedicated trial judges are bound to overlook meritorious cases without the benefit of an adversary presentation.</p>
<p id="fc185fd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold, therefore, that the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.</p>

<p id="fc1886e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the Court’s valiant efforts, I find its reasoning unpersuasive. More than 20 years of experience with pro se habeas corpus petitions as a Member of this Court and as a Circuit Judge have convinced me that “meaningful access” to the federal courts can seldom be realistically advanced by the device of making law libraries available to prison inmates untutored in their use. In the vast majority of cases, access to a law library will, I am convinced, simply result in the filing of pleadings heavily larded with irrelevant legalisms possessing the veneer but lacking the substance of professional competence.</p>

<p id="fc1886eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s reasoning today appears to be that we have long held that prisoners have a “right of access” to the courts in order to file petitions for habeas corpus, and that subsequent decisions have expanded this concept into what the Court today describes as a “meaningful right of access.” So, we are told, the right of a convicted prisoner to “meaningful access” extends to requiring the State to furnish such prisoners law libraries to aid them in piecing together complaints to be filed in the courts. This analysis places questions of prisoner access on a “slippery slope,” and I would reject it because I believe that the early cases upon which the Court relies have a totally different rationale from that which underlies the present holding. There is nothing in the United States Constitution which requires that a convict serving a term of imprisonment in a state penal institution pursuant to a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction have a “right of access” to the federal courts in order to attack his sentence.</p>

<p id="fc1886f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc1886f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents are 22 inmates of various prisons operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections. In January 1990, they filed this class action “on behalf of all adult prisoners who are or will be incarcerated by the State of Arizona Department of Corrections,” alleging that petitioners were “depriving [respondents] of their rights of access to the courts and counsel protected by the First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.” The court identified a variety of shortcomings of the ADOC system, in matters ranging from the training of library staff, to the updating of legal materials, to the availability of photocopying services. In addition to these general findings, the court found that two groups of inmates were particularly affected by the system’s inadequacies: “[l]ockdown prisoners” (inmates segregated from the general prison population for disciplinary or security reasons), who “are routinely denied physical access to the law library” and “experience severe interference with their access to the courts”; and illiterate or non-English-speaking inmates, who do not receive adequate legal assistance.</p>
<p id="fc1886f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement that an inmate alleging a violation of <i>Bounds</i> must show actual injury derives ultimately from the doctrine of standing, a constitutional principle that prevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches. It is the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution. In the context of the present case: It is for the courts to remedy past or imminent official interference with individual inmates’ presentation of claims to the courts; it is for the political branches of the State and Federal Governments to manage prisons in such fashion that official interference with the presentation of claims will not occur.</p>
<p id="fc1886f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing analysis would not be pertinent here if, as respondents seem to assume, the right at issue—the right to which the actual or threatened harm must pertain—were the right to a law library or to legal assistance. But <i>Bounds</i> established no such right. The right that <i>Bounds</i> acknowledged was the (already well-established) right of access to the courts.</p>
<p id="fc1886f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, prison law libraries and legal assistance programs are not ends in themselves, but only the means for ensuring “a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.” Because <i>Bounds</i> did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance, an inmate cannot establish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that his prison’s law library or legal assistance program is subpar in some theoretical sense. That would be the precise analog of the healthy inmate claiming constitutional violation because of the inadequacy of the prison infirmary. Insofar as the right vindicated by <i>Bounds</i> is concerned, “meaningful access to the courts is the touchstone,” and the inmate therefore must go one step further and demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim. He might show, for example, that a complaint he prepared was dismissed for <span title="1120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1120">p. 1120</span>failure to satisfy some technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the prison’s legal assistance facilities, he could not have known. Or that he had suffered arguably actionable harm that he wished to bring before the courts, but was so stymied by inadequacies of the law library that he was unable even to file a complaint.</p>
<p id="fc1886f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Bounds</i> itself made no mention of an actual-injury requirement, it can hardly be thought to have eliminated that constitutional prerequisite. And actual injury is apparent on the face of almost all the opinions in the 35-year line of access-to-courts cases on which <i>Bounds</i> relied. It must be acknowledged that several statements in <i>Bounds</i> went beyond the right of access recognized in the earlier cases on which it relied, which was a right to bring to court a grievance that the inmate wished to present. These statements appear to suggest that the State must enable the prisoner to discover grievances, and to litigate effectively once in court. These elaborations upon the right of access to the courts have no antecedent in our pre-<i>Bounds</i> cases, and we now disclaim them. To demand the conferral of such sophisticated legal capabilities upon a mostly uneducated and indeed largely illiterate prison population is effectively to demand permanent provision of counsel, which we do not believe the Constitution requires.</p>
<p id="fc18ae09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we must observe that the injury requirement is not satisfied by just any type of frustrated legal claim. Nearly all of the access-to-courts cases in the <i>Bounds</i> line involved attempts by inmates to pursue direct appeals from the convictions for which they were incarcerated. In other words, <i>Bounds</i> does not guarantee inmates the wherewithal to transform themselves into litigating engines capable of filing everything from shareholder derivative actions to slip-and-fall claims. The tools it requires to be provided are those that the inmates need in order to attack their sentences, directly or collaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement. Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration.</p>
<p id="fc18ae0a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are further reasons why the order here cannot stand. We held in Turner v. Safley (1987) that a prison regulation impinging on inmates’ constitutional rights “is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Such a deferential standard is necessary, we explained, “if ‘prison administrators . . . , and not the courts, [are] to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.’ Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration.”</p>

<p id="fc18ae0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution charges federal judges with deciding cases and controversies, not with running state prisons. Yet, too frequently, federal district courts in the name of the Constitution effect wholesale takeovers of state correctional facilities and run them by judicial decree. This case is a textbook example. Dissatisfied with the quality of the law libraries and the legal assistance at Arizona’s correctional institutions, the District Court imposed a statewide decree on the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC), dictating in excruciatingly minute detail a program to assist inmates in the filing of lawsuits—right down to permissible noise levels in library reading rooms. Such gross overreaching by a federal district court simply cannot be tolerated in our federal system. Principles <span title="1121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1121">p. 1121</span>of federalism and separation of powers dictate that exclusive responsibility for administering state prisons resides with the State and its officials.</p>
<p id="fc18ae0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Bounds v. Smith (1977), we recognized as part of the State’s constitutional obligations a duty to provide prison inmates with law libraries or other legal assistance at state expense, an obligation we described as part of a loosely defined “right of access to the courts” enjoyed by prisoners. While the Constitution may guarantee state inmates an opportunity to bring suit to vindicate their federal constitutional rights, I find no basis in the Constitution—and <i>Bounds</i> cited none—for the right to have the government finance the endeavor.</p>
<p id="fc18ae0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc18ae0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While at least one 19th-century court characterized the prison inmate as a mere “slave of the State,” Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790 (1871), in recent decades this Court has repeatedly held that the convicted felon’s loss of liberty is not total. See Turner v. Safley (1987). “Prison walls do not . . . separat[e] . . . inmates from the protections of the Constitution,” and even convicted criminals retain some of the liberties enjoyed by all who live outside those walls in communities to which most prisoners will someday return.</p>
<p id="fc18ae10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “well-established” right of access to the courts is one of these aspects of liberty that States must affirmatively protect. The right to claim a violation of a constitutional provision in a manner that will be recognized by the courts is also embedded in those rights recognized by the Constitution’s text and our interpretations of it. Without the ability to access the courts and draw their attention to constitutionally improper behavior, all of us—prisoners and free citizens alike—would be deprived of the first—and often the only—“line of defense” against constitutional violations.</p>
<p id="fc18ae11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we had reason to delve into standing requirements in this case, the Court’s view of those requirements is excessively strict. I think it perfectly clear that the prisoners had standing, even absent the specific examples of failed complaints. There is a constitutional right to effective access, and if a prisoner alleges that he personally has been denied that right, he has standing to sue.</p>

<p id="fc18d52d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first Texas State Constitution, promulgated upon Texas’ entry into the Union in 1845, provided for the establishment of a system of free schools. Until recent times, Texas was a predominantly rural State and its population and property wealth were spread relatively evenly across the State. Sizable differences in the value of assessable property between local school districts became increasingly evident as the State became more industrialized and as rural-to-urban population shifts became more pronounced. The location of commercial and industrial property began to play a significant role in determining the amount of tax resources available to each school district. These growing disparities in population and taxable property between districts were responsible in part for increasingly notable differences in levels of local expenditure for education.</p>
<p id="fc18d52e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing the need for increased state funding to help offset disparities in local spending and to meet Texas’ changing educational requirements, the state legislature in the late 1940s undertook a thorough evaluation of public education with an eye toward major reform. [T]he Texas Minimum Foundation School Program [was adopted and t]oday this Program accounts for approximately half of the total educational expenditures in Texas. The Program calls for state and local contributions to a fund earmarked specifically for teacher salaries, operating expenses, and transportation costs. The State, supplying funds from its general revenues, finances approximately 80% of the Program, and the school districts are responsible—as a unit—for providing the remaining 20%. Today every school district does impose a property tax from which it derives locally expendable funds in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy its Local Fund Assignment under the Foundation Program.</p>
<p id="fc18d52f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school district in which appellees reside, the Edgewood Independent School District, has been compared throughout this litigation with the Alamo Heights Independent School District. This comparison between the least and most affluent districts in the San Antonio area serves to illustrate the manner in which the dual system of finance operates and to indicate the extent to which substantial disparities exist despite the State’s impressive progress in recent years. Edgewood is one of seven public school districts in the metropolitan area. Approximately 22,000 students are enrolled in its 25 elementary and secondary schools. The district is situated in the core-city sector of San Antonio in a residential neighborhood that has little commercial or industrial property. The residents are predominantly of Mexican-American descent: approximately 90% of the student population is Mexican-American and over 6% is Negro. The average assessed property value per pupil is $5,960—the lowest in the metropolitan area—and the median family income ($4,686) is also the lowest. At an equalized tax rate of $1.05 per $100 of assessed property—the highest in the metropolitan area—the district contributed $26 to the education of each child for the 1967-1968 school year above its Local Fund Assignment for the Minimum Foundation Program. The Foundation Program contributed $222 per pupil for <span title="1123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1123">p. 1123</span>a state-local total of $248. Federal funds added another $108 for a total of $356 per pupil.</p>
<p id="fc18d530-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alamo Heights is the most affluent school district in San Antonio. Its six schools, housing approximately 5,000 students, are situated in a residential community quite unlike the Edgewood District. The school population is predominantly “Anglo,” having only 18% Mexican-Americans and less than 1% Negroes. The assessed property value per pupil exceeds $49,000, and the median family income is $8,001. In 1967-1968 the local tax rate of $.85 per $100 of valuation yielded $333 per pupil over and above its contribution to the Foundation Program. Coupled with the $225 provided from that Program, the district was able to supply $558 per student. Supplemented by a $36 per-pupil grant from federal sources, Alamo Heights spent $594 per pupil.</p>
<p id="fc18d531-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This, then, establishes the framework for our analysis. We must decide, first, whether the Texas system of financing public education operates to the disadvantage of some suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution, thereby requiring strict judicial scrutiny. If not, the Texas scheme must still be examined to determine whether it rationally furthers some legitimate, articulated state purpose and therefore does not constitute an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fc18d533-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]ppellees assert that the State’s system impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a “fundamental” right and that accordingly the prior decisions of this Court require the application of the strict standard of judicial review.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN125D9_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N125D9_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">48</a></span> It is this question—whether education is a fundamental right, in the sense that it is among the rights and liberties protected by the Constitution—which has so consumed the attention of courts and commentators in recent years. Nothing this Court holds today in any way detracts from our historic dedication to public education. But the importance of a service performed by the State does not determine whether it must be regarded as fundamental for purposes of examination under the Equal Protection Clause. It is not the province of this Court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws. Thus, the key to discovering whether education is “fundamental” is not to be found in comparisons of the relative societal significance of education as opposed to subsistence or housing. Nor is it to be found by weighing whether education is as important as the right to travel. Rather, the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right to education explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc18d535-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Education, of course, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is <span title="1124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1124">p. 1124</span>implicitly so protected. As we have said, the undisputed importance of education will not alone cause this Court to depart from the usual standard for reviewing a State’s social and economic legislation. It is appellees’ contention, however, that education is distinguishable from other services and benefits provided by the State because it bears a peculiarly close relationship to other rights and liberties accorded protection under the Constitution. Specifically, they insist that education is itself a fundamental personal right because it is essential to the effective exercise of First Amendment freedoms and to intelligent utilization of the right to vote.</p>
<p id="fc18d536-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of either right, we have no indication that the present levels of educational expenditures in Texas provide an education that falls short. Whatever merit appellees’ argument might have if a State’s financing system occasioned an absolute denial of educational opportunities to any of its children, that argument provides no basis for finding an interference with fundamental rights where only relative differences in spending levels are involved and where—as is true in the present case—no charge fairly could be made that the system fails to provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full participation in the political process.</p>
<p id="fc18d537-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, the logical limitations on appellees’ nexus theory are difficult to perceive. How, for instance, is education to be distinguished from the significant personal interests in the basics of decent food and shelter? Empirical examination might well buttress an assumption that the ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed are among the most ineffective participants in the political process, and that they derive the least enjoyment from the benefits of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc18d538-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be clear, for the reasons stated above and in accord with the prior decisions of this Court, that this is not a case in which the challenged state action must be subjected to the searching judicial scrutiny reserved for laws that create suspect classifications or impinge upon constitutionally protected rights. We need not rest our decision, however, solely on the inappropriateness of the strict-scrutiny test. A century of Supreme Court adjudication under the Equal Protection Clause affirmatively supports the application of the traditional standard of review, which requires only that the State’s system be shown to bear some rational relationship to legitimate state purposes.</p>
<p id="fc18d539-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e are urged to direct the States either to alter drastically the present system or to throw out the property tax altogether in favor of some other form of taxation. No scheme of taxation, whether the tax is imposed on property, income, or purchases of goods and services, has yet been devised which is free of all discriminatory impact. In such a complex arena in which no perfect alternatives exist, the Court does well not to impose too rigorous a standard of scrutiny lest all local fiscal schemes become subjects of criticism under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fc18d53a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to matters of fiscal policy, this case also involves the most persistent and difficult questions of educational policy, another area in which this Court’s lack of specialized knowledge and experience counsels against premature interference with the informed judgments made at the state and local levels. Education, perhaps even more than welfare assistance, presents a myriad of “intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems.” In such circumstances, the judiciary is well advised to refrain from imposing on the States <span title="1125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1125">p. 1125</span>inflexible constitutional restraints that could circumscribe or handicap the continued research and experimentation so vital to finding even partial solutions to educational problems and to keeping abreast of ever-changing conditions.</p>
<p id="fc18d53b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be remembered, also, that every claim arising under the Equal Protection Clause has implications for the relationship between national and state power under our federal system. Questions of federalism are always inherent in the process of determining whether a State’s laws are to be accorded the traditional presumption of constitutionality, or are to be subjected instead to rigorous judicial scrutiny. While “[t]he maintenance of the principles of federalism is a foremost consideration in interpreting any of the pertinent constitutional provisions under which this Court examines state action,” it would be difficult to imagine a case having a greater potential impact on our federal system than the one now before us, in which we are urged to abrogate systems of financing public education presently in existence in virtually every State.</p>
<p id="fc18d53c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc18d53d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although I agree with my Brother White that the Texas statutory scheme is devoid of any rational basis, and for that reason is violative of the Equal Protection Clause, I also record my disagreement with the Court’s rather distressing assertion that a right may be deemed “fundamental” for the purposes of equal protection analysis only if it is “explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.” As my Brother Marshall convincingly demonstrates, our prior cases stand for the proposition that “fundamentality” is, in large measure, a function of the right’s importance in terms of the effectuation of those rights which are in fact constitutionally guaranteed. Thus, “[a]s the nexus between the specific constitutional guarantee and the nonconstitutional interest draws closer, the nonconstitutional interest becomes more fundamental and the degree of judicial scrutiny applied when the interest is infringed on a discriminatory basis must be adjusted accordingly.”</p>
<p id="fc18d53e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, there can be no doubt that education is inextricably linked to the right to participate in the electoral process and to the rights of free speech and association guaranteed by the First Amendment. This being so, any classification affecting education must be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny, and since even the State concedes that the statutory scheme now before us cannot pass constitutional muster under this stricter standard of review, I can only conclude that the Texas school-financing scheme is constitutionally invalid.</p>
<p id="fc18d53f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall,</span> with whom Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> concurs, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc18fc50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today decides, in effect, that a State may constitutionally vary the quality of education which it offers its children in accordance with the amount of taxable wealth located in the school districts within which they reside. The majority’s decision represents an abrupt departure from the mainstream of recent state and federal court decisions concerning the unconstitutionality of state educational financing schemes dependent upon taxable local wealth. More unfortunately, though, the majority’s holding can only be seen as a retreat from our historic commitment to equality of educational opportunity and as unsupportable acquiescence in a system which deprives children in their earliest years of the chance to reach their full potential as citizens. The Court does this despite the absence of any substantial justification for a scheme which arbitrarily channels educational resources in accordance with the fortuity of the amount of taxable wealth within each district.</p>
<p id="fc18fc51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1126">p. 1126</span>In my judgment, the right of every American to an equal start in life, so far as the provision of a state service as important as education is concerned, is far too vital to permit state discrimination on grounds as tenuous as those presented by this record. Nor can I accept the notion that it is sufficient to remit these appellees to the vagaries of the political process which, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, has proved singularly unsuited to the task of providing a remedy for this discrimination. I, for one, am unsatisfied with the hope of an ultimate “political” solution sometime in the indefinite future while, in the meantime, countless children unjustifiably receive inferior educations that may “affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” Brown v. Board of Education (1954). I must therefore respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fc18fc52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority is, of course, correct when it suggests that the process of determining which interests are fundamental is a difficult one. But I do not think the problem is insurmountable. And I certainly do not accept the view that the process need necessarily degenerate into an unprincipled, subjective “picking-and-choosing” between various interests or that it must involve this Court in creating “substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.” Although not all fundamental interests are constitutionally guaranteed, the determination of which interests are fundamental should be firmly rooted in the text of the Constitution. The task in every case should be to determine the extent to which constitutionally guaranteed rights are dependent on interests not mentioned in the Constitution. As the nexus between the specific constitutional guarantee and the nonconstitutional interest draws closer, the nonconstitutional interest becomes more fundamental and the degree of judicial scrutiny applied when the interest is infringed on a discriminatory basis must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p id="fc18fc53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it cannot be denied that interests such as procreation, the exercise of the state franchise, and access to criminal appellate processes are not fully guaranteed to the citizen by our Constitution. But these interests have nonetheless been afforded special judicial consideration in the face of discrimination because they are, to some extent, interrelated with constitutional guarantees. Procreation is now understood to be important because of its interaction with the established constitutional right of privacy. The exercise of the state franchise is closely tied to basic civil and political rights inherent in the First Amendment. And access to criminal appellate processes enhances the integrity of the range of rights implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process of law. Only if we closely protect the related interests from state discrimination do we ultimately ensure the integrity of the constitutional guarantee itself. This is the real lesson that must be taken from our previous decisions involving interests deemed to be fundamental.</p>
<p id="fc18fc54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the Court now suggests that only interests guaranteed by the Constitution are fundamental for purposes of equal protection analysis, and since it rejects the contention that public education is fundamental, it follows that the Court concludes that public education is not constitutionally guaranteed. It is true that this Court has never deemed the provision of free public education to be required by the Constitution. Nevertheless, the fundamental importance of education is amply indicated by the prior decisions of this Court, by the unique status accorded public education by our society, and by the close relationship between education and some of our most basic constitutional values.</p>
<p id="fc18fc55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Education directly affects the ability of a child to exercise his First Amendment rights, both as a source and as a receiver of information and ideas, whatever <span title="1127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1127">p. 1127</span>interests he may pursue in life. The opportunity for formal education may not necessarily be the essential determinant of an individual’s ability to enjoy throughout his life the rights of free speech and association guaranteed to him by the First Amendment. But such an opportunity may enhance the individual’s enjoyment of those rights, not only during but also following school attendance. Thus, in the final analysis, “the pivotal position of education to success in American society and its essential role in opening up to the individual the central experiences of our culture lend it an importance that is undeniable.”</p>
<p id="fc18fc56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of particular importance is the relationship between education and the political process. “Americans regard the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government.” Education serves the essential function of instilling in our young an understanding of and appreciation for the principles and operation of our governmental processes. Education may instill the interest and provide the tools necessary for political discourse and debate. Indeed, it has frequently been suggested that education is the dominant factor affecting political consciousness and participation. But of most immediate and direct concern must be the demonstrated effect of education on the exercise of the franchise by the electorate.</p>
<p id="fc18fc57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees do not now seek the best education Texas might provide. They do seek, however, an end to state discrimination resulting from the unequal distribution of taxable district property wealth that directly impairs the ability of some districts to provide the same educational opportunity that other districts can provide with the same or even substantially less tax effort. The issue is, in other words, one of discrimination that affects the quality of the education which Texas has chosen to provide its children; and, the precise question here is what importance should attach to education for purposes of equal protection analysis of that discrimination. As this Court held in Brown v. Board of Education, the opportunity of education, “where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” The factors just considered, including the relationship between education and the social and political interests enshrined within the Constitution, compel us to recognize the fundamentality of education and to scrutinize with appropriate care the bases for state discrimination affecting equality of educational opportunity in Texas’ school districts.</p>
<p id="fc18fc58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court seeks solace for its action today in the possibility of legislative reform. The Court’s suggestions of legislative redress and experimentation will doubtless be of great comfort to the schoolchildren of Texas’ disadvantaged districts, but considering the vested interests of wealthy school districts in the preservation of the status quo, they are worth little more. The possibility of legislative action is, in all events, no answer to this Court’s duty under the Constitution to eliminate unjustified state discrimination. In this case we have been presented with an instance of such discrimination, in a particularly invidious form, against an individual interest of large constitutional and practical importance. To support the demonstrated discrimination in the provision of educational opportunity the State has offered a justification which, on analysis, takes on at best an ephemeral character. Thus, I believe that the wide disparities in taxable district property wealth inherent in the local property tax element of the Texas financing scheme render that scheme violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U.S. 450 (1988), the Court reaffirmed that education is not a fundamental right under the Equal Protection Clause. <i>Kadrmas</i> involved a challenge brought by a poor family to a state law authorizing local school systems to charge a fee for use of school buses. The Court again reiterated that poverty is not a suspect classification and that discrimination against the poor has to meet only rational basis review. The Court said that education was not denied because the fee did not preclude the student from attending school. Hence, the Court said that rational basis review was appropriate and concluded that the plaintiffs “failed to carry the ‘heavy burden’ of demonstrating the challenged statute is both arbitrary and irrational.”</p>
<p id="fc18fc5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Court never has held that there is a fundamental right to education, the Court has recognized education’s importance. In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Texas law that provided a free public education to citizens and to children of documented immigrants but required undocumented immigrants to pay for their public education.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1264E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1264E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">49</a></span> The Court ruled that the law denied equal protection and, in part, based this conclusion on the importance of education. Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, stated, “Public education is not a ‘right’ granted to individuals by the Constitution. But neither is it merely some governmental ‘benefit’ indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation. Both the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child, mark the distinction. . . . [E]ducation provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all. In sum, education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society.”</p>
<p id="fc18fc5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court emphasized the great harms to children if they are denied an education. The Court also stressed the unfairness of penalizing children because of the choices made by their parents. Thus, without declaring education to be a fundamental right or using strict scrutiny, the Court invalidated the Texas law.</p>
<p id="fc18fc5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s refusal to find a fundamental right to education is consistent with its general unwillingness to hold that there are constitutional rights to affirmative services provided by the government. But there is a strong argument that education is different; education is essential for the exercise of constitutional rights, for economic opportunity, and ultimately for achieving equality. In fact, several state courts—including the Texas Supreme Court—have found a fundamental right to education under their state constitutions and have concluded that inequities in school funding are impermissible as a matter of state constitutional law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1265E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1265E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">50</a></span></p>

<p id="fc18fc61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, this chapter has focused on the protection of fundamental rights under due process and equal protection. The Due Process Clause also is used <span title="1129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1129">p. 1129</span>in another way: to impose procedures on government when it takes away a person’s life, liberty, or property. This is referred to as “procedural due process.”</p>
<p id="fc192372-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural due process, as the phrase implies, refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Classic procedural due process issues concern what kind of notice and what form of hearing the government must provide when it takes a particular action.</p>
<p id="fc192373-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”Substantive due process,” as that phrase connotes, asks whether the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person’s life, liberty, or property. In other words, substantive due process looks to whether there is sufficient justification for the government’s action. Whether there is such justification depends very much on the level of scrutiny used. For example, if a law addresses an area where only rational basis review is applied, substantive due process is met as long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. But if it concerns an area where strict scrutiny is used, such as for protecting fundamental rights, then the government will meet substantive due process only if it can prove that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.</p>
<p id="fc192374-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An illustration of the distinction between procedural and substantive due process can be found in the constitutional right of parents to custody of their children. The Supreme Court has held that parents have a liberty interest in the custody of their children.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12686_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12686_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">51</a></span> Therefore, procedural due process requires that the government provide notice and a hearing, and that there be clear and convincing evidence of a need to terminate custody, before parental rights are permanently ended.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12691_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12691_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">52</a></span> Because the right to custody is deemed a fundamental right, substantive due process requires that the government prove that terminating custody is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose, such as the need to prevent abuse or neglect of the child.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12699_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12699_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">53</a></span></p>
<p id="fc192378-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it is possible to distinguish procedural and substantive due process based on the remedy sought. If the plaintiff is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional as violating a constitutional right, substantive due process is involved. But when a person or a group is seeking to have a government action declared unconstitutional because of the lack of adequate safeguards, such as notice and a hearing, procedural due process is the issue.</p>
<p id="fc192379-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural and substantive due process can involve some of the same questions. For example, for both, it often is necessary to define what is “liberty” or “property.” If there is not a denial of life, liberty, or property, then the government does not have to provide procedural or substantive due process.</p>
<p id="fc19237a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural due process can be broken down into three basic questions: (1) Has there been a “deprivation”? (2) Is it of “life, liberty, or property”? (3) Is it without “due process of law”? Thus, subsection 1 of this section looks at what is a deprivation; subsection 2 considers whether it is of life, liberty, or property; and subsection 3 focuses on what procedures are required.</p>

<p id="fc194a97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc194a98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.</p>
<p id="fc194a99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this §1983 action, petitioner seeks to recover damages for back and ankle injuries allegedly sustained when he fell on a prison stairway. He claims that, while an inmate at the city jail in Richmond, Virginia, he slipped on a pillow negligently left on the stairs by respondent, a correctional deputy stationed at the jail. Respondent’s negligence, the argument runs, “deprived” petitioner of his “liberty” interest in freedom from bodily injury, see Ingraham v. Wright (1977); because respondent maintains that he is entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity in a state tort suit, petitioner is without an “adequate” state remedy. Accordingly, the deprivation of liberty was without “due process of law.”</p>
<p id="fc194a9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: “[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Historically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property. This history reflects the traditional and common-sense notion that the Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta, was “‘intended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government.’” By requiring the government to follow appropriate procedures when its agents decide to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,” the Due Process Clause promotes fairness in such decisions. And by barring certain government actions <span title="1131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1131">p. 1131</span>regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them, it serves to prevent governmental power from being “used for purposes of oppression.”</p>
<p id="fc194a9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that the actions of prison custodians in leaving a pillow on the prison stairs, or mislaying an inmate’s property, are quite remote from the concerns just discussed. Far from an abuse of power, lack of due care suggests no more than a failure to measure up to the conduct of a reasonable person. To hold that injury caused by such conduct is a deprivation within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment would trivialize the centuries-old principle of due process of law.</p>
<p id="fc194a9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our Constitution deals with the large concerns of the governors and the governed, but it does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society. We have previously rejected reasoning that “‘would make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States.’”</p>
<p id="fc194a9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That injuries inflicted by governmental negligence are not addressed by the United States Constitution is not to say that they may not raise significant legal concerns and lead to the creation of protectible legal interests. The enactment of tort claim statutes, for example, reflects the view that injuries caused by such negligence should generally be redressed. It is no reflection on either the breadth of the United States Constitution or the importance of traditional tort law to say that they do not address the same concerns. Where a government official’s act causing injury to life, liberty, or property is merely negligent, “no procedure for compensation is constitutionally required.”</p>

In <i>Davidson</i>, a prisoner claimed that prison authorities violated his due process rights by failing to protect him from attack by another prisoner. The prisoner had been threatened and had informed prison authorities, but they inadvertently forgot about the message and the prisoner was subsequently seriously injured by the attack.

<p id="fc1971b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 22, 1990, at approximately 8:30 p.m., petitioner James Everett Smith, a Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy, along with another officer, Murray Stapp, responded to a call to break up a fight. Upon returning to his patrol car, Stapp saw a motorcycle approaching at high speed. It was operated by 18-year-old Brian Willard and carried Philip Lewis, respondents’ 16-year-old decedent, as a passenger. Neither boy had anything to do with the fight that prompted the call to the police.</p>
<p id="fc1971ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stapp turned on his overhead rotating lights, yelled to the boys to stop, and pulled his patrol car closer to Smith’s, attempting to pen the motorcycle in. Instead of pulling over in response to Stapp’s warning lights and commands, Willard slowly maneuvered the cycle between the two police cars and sped off. Smith immediately switched on his own emergency lights and siren, made a quick turn, and began pursuit at high speed. For 75 seconds over a course of 1.3 miles in a residential neighborhood, the motorcycle wove in and out of oncoming traffic, forcing two cars and a bicycle to swerve off of the road. The motorcycle and patrol car reached speeds up to 100 miles an hour, with Smith following at a distance as short as 100 feet; at that speed, his car would have required 650 feet to stop.</p>
<p id="fc1971bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chase ended after the motorcycle tipped over as Willard tried a sharp left turn. By the time Smith slammed on his brakes, Willard was out of the way, but Lewis was not. The patrol car skidded into him at 40 miles an hour, propelling him some 70 feet down the road and inflicting massive injuries. Lewis was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p id="fc1971bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the time of our early explanations of due process, we have understood the core of the concept to be protection against arbitrary action. We have emphasized time and again that “[t]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,” whether the fault lies in a denial of fundamental procedural fairness, or in the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective. While due process protection in the substantive sense limits what the government may do in both its legislative, and its executive capacities, criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue.</p>
<p id="fc1971bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases dealing with abusive executive action have repeatedly emphasized that only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be “arbitrary in the constitutional sense,” thereby recognizing the point made in different circumstances by Chief Justice Marshall, “that it is a constitution we are expounding.” To this end, for half a century now we have spoken of the cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that which shocks the conscience. We first put the test this way in Rochin v. California, where we found the forced pumping of a <span title="1133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1133">p. 1133</span>suspect’s stomach enough to offend due process as conduct “that shocks the conscience” and violates the “decencies of civilized conduct.” In the intervening years we have repeatedly adhered to <i>Rochin</i>’s benchmark. While the measure of what is conscience-shocking is no calibrated yardstick, it does, as Judge Friendly put it, point[] the way.”</p>
<p id="fc1971be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should not be surprising that the constitutional concept of conscience-shocking duplicates no traditional category of common-law fault, but rather points clearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort law’s spectrum of culpability. Thus, we have made it clear that the due process guarantee does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm.</p>
<p id="fc1971bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have accordingly rejected the lowest common denominator of customary tort liability as any mark of sufficiently shocking conduct, and have held that the Constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials; liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process. See Daniels v. Williams. It is, on the contrary, behavior at the other end of the culpability spectrum that would most probably support a substantive due process claim; conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level.</p>
<p id="fc1998d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the very term “deliberate indifference” implies, the standard is sensibly employed only when actual deliberation is practical, and in the custodial situation of a prison, forethought about an inmate’s welfare is not only feasible but obligatory under a regime that incapacitates a prisoner to exercise ordinary responsibility for his own welfare.</p>
<p id="fc1998d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like prison officials facing a riot, the police on an occasion calling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug against each other. Their duty is to restore and maintain lawful order, while not exacerbating disorder more than necessary to do their jobs. They are supposed to act decisively and to show restraint at the same moment, and their decisions have to be made “in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.” A police officer deciding whether to give chase must balance on one hand the need to stop a suspect and show that flight from the law is no way to freedom, and, on the other, the high-speed threat to everyone within stopping range, be they suspects, their passengers, other drivers, or bystanders.</p>
<p id="fc1998d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To recognize a substantive due process violation in these circumstances when only mid-level fault has been shown would be to forget that liability for deliberate indifference to inmate welfare rests upon the luxury enjoyed by prison officials of having time to make unhurried judgments, upon the chance for repeated reflection, largely uncomplicated by the pulls of competing obligations. When such extended opportunities to do better are teamed with protracted failure even to care, indifference is truly shocking. But when unforeseen circumstances demand an officer’s instant judgment, even precipitate recklessness fails to inch close enough to harmful purpose to spark the shock that implicates “the large concerns of the governors and the governed.” Just as a purpose to cause harm is needed for Eighth Amendment liability in a riot case, so it ought to be needed for Due Process liability in a pursuit case. Accordingly, we hold that high-speed chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability under the Fourteenth Amendment, redressible by an action under §1983.</p>
<p id="fc1998d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1134" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1134">p. 1134</span>The fault claimed on Smith’s part in this case accordingly fails to meet the shocks-the-conscience test. The summary judgment proceedings revealed that the height of the fault actually claimed was “conscious disregard,” the malice allegation having been made in aid of a request for punitive damages, but unsupported either in allegations of specific conduct or in any affidavit of fact offered on the motions for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="fc1998d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smith was faced with a course of lawless behavior for which the police were not to blame. They had done nothing to cause Willard’s high-speed driving in the first place, nothing to excuse his flouting of the commonly understood law enforcement authority to control traffic, and nothing (beyond a refusal to call off the chase) to encourage him to race through traffic at breakneck speed forcing other drivers out of their travel lanes. Willard’s outrageous behavior was practically instantaneous, and so was Smith’s instinctive response. While prudence would have repressed the reaction, the officer’s instinct was to do his job as a law enforcement officer, not to induce Willard’s lawlessness, or to terrorize, cause harm, or kill. Prudence, that is, was subject to countervailing enforcement considerations, and while Smith exaggerated their demands, there is no reason to believe that they were tainted by an improper or malicious motive on his part.</p>
<p id="fc1998d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless whether Smith’s behavior offended the reasonableness held up by tort law or the balance struck in law enforcement’s own codes of sound practice, it does not shock the conscience, and petitioners are not called upon to answer for it under §1983.</p>

<p id="fc19bff1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of this case are undeniably tragic. Petitioner Joshua DeShaney was born in 1979. In 1980, a Wyoming court granted his parents a divorce and <span title="1135" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1135">p. 1135</span>awarded custody of Joshua to his father, Randy DeShaney. The father shortly thereafter moved to Neenah, a city located in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, taking the infant Joshua with him. There he entered into a second marriage, which also ended in divorce.</p>
<p id="fc19bff2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Winnebago County authorities first learned that Joshua DeShaney might be a victim of child abuse in January 1982, when his father’s second wife complained to the police, at the time of their divorce, that he had previously “hit the boy causing marks and [was] a prime case for child abuse.” The Winnebago County Department of Social Services (DSS) interviewed the father, but he denied the accusations, and DSS did not pursue them further. In January 1983, Joshua was admitted to a local hospital with multiple bruises and abrasions. The examining physician suspected child abuse and notified DSS, which immediately obtained an order from a Wisconsin juvenile court placing Joshua in the temporary custody of the hospital. Three days later, the county convened an ad hoc “Child Protection Team”—consisting of a pediatrician, a psychologist, a police detective, the county’s lawyer, several DSS caseworkers, and various hospital personnel—to consider Joshua’s situation. At this meeting, the Team decided that there was insufficient evidence of child abuse to retain Joshua in the custody of the court. The Team did, however, decide to recommend several measures to protect Joshua, including enrolling him in a preschool program, providing his father with certain counselling services, and encouraging his father’s girlfriend to move out of the home. Randy DeShaney entered into a voluntary agreement with DSS in which he promised to cooperate with them in accomplishing these goals.</p>
<p id="fc19bff3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the recommendation of the Child Protection Team, the juvenile court dismissed the child protection case and returned Joshua to the custody of his father. A month later, emergency room personnel called the DSS caseworker handling Joshua’s case to report that he had once again been treated for suspicious injuries. The caseworker concluded that there was no basis for action. For the next six months, the caseworker made monthly visits to the DeShaney home, during which she observed a number of suspicious injuries on Joshua’s head; she also noticed that he had not been enrolled in school, and that the girlfriend had not moved out. The caseworker dutifully recorded these incidents in her files, along with her continuing suspicions that someone in the DeShaney household was physically abusing Joshua, but she did nothing more. In November 1983, the emergency room notified DSS that Joshua had been treated once again for injuries that they believed to be caused by child abuse. On the caseworker’s next two visits to the DeShaney home, she was told that Joshua was too ill to see her. Still DSS took no action.</p>
<p id="fc19bff4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 1984, Randy DeShaney beat 4-year-old Joshua so severely that he fell into a life-threatening coma. Emergency brain surgery revealed a series of hemorrhages caused by traumatic injuries to the head inflicted over a long period of time. Joshua did not die, but he suffered brain damage so severe that he is expected to spend the rest of his life confined to an institution for the profoundly retarded. Randy DeShaney was subsequently tried and convicted of child abuse.</p>
<p id="fc19bff5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joshua and his mother brought this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against respondents Winnebago County, DSS, and various individual employees of DSS. The complaint alleged that respondents had deprived Joshua of his liberty without <span title="1136" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1136">p. 1136</span>due process of law, in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, by failing to intervene to protect him against a risk of violence at his father’s hands of which they knew or should have known.</p>
<p id="fc19bff6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend that the State deprived Joshua of his liberty interest in “free[dom] from . . . unjustified intrusions on personal security,” see Ingraham v. Wright (1977), by failing to provide him with adequate protection against his father’s violence. But nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors. The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State’s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security. It forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without “due process of law,” but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means. Nor does history support such an expansive reading of the constitutional text. Like its counterpart in the Fifth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to prevent government “from abusing [its] power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression.” Its purpose was to protect the people from the State, not to ensure that the State protected them from each other. The framers were content to leave the extent of governmental obligation in the latter area to the democratic political processes.</p>
<p id="fc19bff7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consistent with these principles, our cases have recognized that the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual. If the Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide its citizens with particular protective services, it follows that the State cannot be held liable under the Clause for injuries that could have been averted had it chosen to provide them. As a general matter, then, we conclude that a State’s failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc19bff8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend, however, that even if the Due Process Clause imposes no affirmative obligation on the State to provide the general public with adequate protective services, such a duty may arise out of certain “special relationships” created or assumed by the State with respect to particular individuals. Petitioners argue that such a “special relationship” existed here because the State knew that Joshua faced a special danger of abuse at his father’s hands, and specifically proclaimed, by word and by deed, its intention to protect him against that danger. Having actually undertaken to protect Joshua from this danger—which petitioners concede the State played no part in creating—the State acquired an affirmative “duty,” enforceable through the Due Process Clause, to do so in a reasonably competent fashion. Its failure to discharge that duty, so the argument goes, was an abuse of governmental power that so “shocks the conscience,” Rochin v. California (1952), as to constitute a substantive due process violation.</p>
<p id="fc19bff9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject this argument. It is true that in certain limited circumstances the Constitution imposes upon the State affirmative duties of care and protection with respect to particular individuals. In Estelle v. Gamble (1976), we recognized that the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, requires the State to provide adequate medical care to <span title="1137" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1137">p. 1137</span>incarcerated prisoners. We reasoned that because the prisoner is unable “by reason of the deprivation of his liberty [to] care for himself,” it is only “just” that the State be required to care for him.</p>
<p id="fc19bffa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But these cases afford petitioners no help. Taken together, they stand only for the proposition that when the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being. The rationale for this principle is simple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual’s liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause. The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State’s knowledge of the individual’s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.</p>
<p id="fc19bffb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners concede that the harms Joshua suffered occurred not while he was in the State’s custody, but while he was in the custody of his natural father, who was in no sense a state actor. While the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them. That the State once took temporary custody of Joshua does not alter the analysis, for when it returned him to his father’s custody, it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all; the State does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual’s safety by having once offered him shelter. Under these circumstances, the State had no constitutional duty to protect Joshua. Because, as explained above, the State had no constitutional duty to protect Joshua against his father’s violence, its failure to do so—though calamitous in hindsight—simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc19bffc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The people of Wisconsin may well prefer a system of liability which would place upon the State and its officials the responsibility for failure to act in situations such as the present one. They may create such a system, if they do not have it already, by changing the tort law of the State in accordance with the regular lawmaking process. But they should not have it thrust upon them by this Court’s expansion of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fc19e70e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The most that can be said of the state functionaries in this case,” the Court today concludes, “is that they stood by and did nothing when suspicious circumstances dictated a more active role for them.” Because I believe that this description of respondents’ conduct tells only part of the story and that, accordingly, the Constitution itself “dictated a more active role” for respondents in the circumstances presented here, I cannot agree that respondents had no constitutional duty to help Joshua DeShaney.</p>
<p id="fc19e70f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may well be, as the Court decides, that the Due Process Clause as construed by our prior cases creates no general right to basic governmental services. That, however, is not the question presented here; indeed, that question was not raised in the complaint, urged on appeal, presented in the petition for <span title="1138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1138">p. 1138</span>certiorari, or addressed in the briefs on the merits. No one, in short, has asked the Court to proclaim that, as a general matter, the Constitution safeguards positive as well as negative liberties.</p>
<p id="fc19e710-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It simply belies reality, therefore, to contend that the State “stood by and did nothing” with respect to Joshua. Through its child-protection program, the State actively intervened in Joshua’s life and, by virtue of this intervention, acquired ever more certain knowledge that Joshua was in grave danger.</p>
<p id="fc19e711-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s baseline is the absence of positive rights in the Constitution and a concomitant suspicion of any claim that seems to depend on such rights. From this perspective, the DeShaneys’ claim is first and foremost about inaction (the failure, here, of respondents to take steps to protect Joshua), and only tangentially about action (the establishment of a state program specifically designed to help children like Joshua). And from this perspective, holding these Wisconsin officials liable—where the only difference between this case and one involving a general claim to protective services is Wisconsin’s establishment and operation of a program to protect children—would seem to punish an effort that we should seek to promote.</p>
<p id="fc19e712-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would begin from the opposite direction. I would focus first on the action that Wisconsin has taken with respect to Joshua and children like him, rather than on the actions that the State failed to take. I would recognize, as the Court apparently cannot, that “the State’s knowledge of [an] individual’s predicament [and] its expressions of intent to help him” can amount to a “limitation . . . on his freedom to act on his own behalf” or to obtain help from others.</p>
<p id="fc19e713-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wisconsin has established a child-welfare system specifically designed to help children like Joshua. Wisconsin law places upon the local departments of social services such as respondent (DSS or Department) a duty to investigate reported instances of child abuse. See Wis. Stat. §48.981(3) (1987-1988). While other governmental bodies and private persons are largely responsible for the reporting of possible eases of child abuse, see §48.981(2), Wisconsin law channels all such reports to the local departments of social services for evaluation and, if necessary, further action. §48.981(3). Even when it is the sheriff’s office or police department that receives a report of suspected child abuse, that report is referred to local social services departments for action, see §48.981(3)(a); the only exception to this occurs when the reporter fears for the child’s immediate safety. §48.981(3)(b). The specific facts before us bear out this view of Wisconsin’s system of protecting children. Each time someone voiced a suspicion that Joshua was being abused, that information was relayed to the Department for investigation and possible action.</p>
<p id="fc19e714-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these circumstances, a private citizen, or even a person working in a government agency other than DSS, would doubtless feel that her job was done as soon as she had reported her suspicions of child abuse to DSS. Through its child-welfare program, in other words, the State of Wisconsin has relieved ordinary citizens and governmental bodies other than the Department of any sense of obligation to do anything more than report their suspicions of child abuse to DSS. If DSS ignores or dismisses these suspicions, no one will step in to fill the gap. Wisconsin’s child-protection program thus effectively confined Joshua DeShaney within the walls of Randy DeShaney’s violent home until such time as DSS took action to remove him. Conceivably, then, children like Joshua are made worse off by the existence of this program when the persons and entities charged with carrying it out fail to do their jobs.</p>

Today’s opinion construes the Due Process Clause to permit a State to displace private sources of protection and then, at the critical moment, to shrug its shoulders and turn away from the harm that it has promised to try to prevent. Because I cannot agree that our Constitution is indifferent to such indifference, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc19e717-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, the Court purports to be the dispassionate oracle of the law, unmoved by “natural sympathy.” But, in this pretense, the Court itself retreats into a sterile formalism which prevents it from recognizing either the facts of the case before it or the legal norms that should apply to those facts. As Justice Brennan demonstrates, the facts here involve not mere passivity, but active state intervention in the life of Joshua DeShaney—intervention that triggered a fundamental duty to aid the boy once the State learned of the severe danger to which he was exposed.</p>
<p id="fc19e718-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court fails to recognize this duty because it attempts to draw a sharp and rigid line between action and inaction. But such formalistic reasoning has no place in the interpretation of the broad and stirring Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Like the antebellum judges who denied relief to fugitive slaves, the Court today claims that its decision, however harsh, is compelled by existing legal doctrine. On the contrary, the question presented by this case is an open one, and our Fourteenth Amendment precedents may be read more broadly or narrowly depending upon how one chooses to read them. Faced with the choice, I would adopt a “sympathetic” reading, one which comports with dictates of fundamental justice and recognizes that compassion need not be exiled from the province of judging.</p>
<p id="fc19e719-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Poor Joshua! Victim of repeated attacks by an irresponsible, bullying, cowardly, and intemperate father, and abandoned by respondents who placed him in a dangerous predicament and who knew or learned what was going on, and yet did essentially nothing except, as the Court revealingly observes, “dutifully recorded these incidents in [their] files.” It is a sad commentary upon American life, and constitutional principles—so full of late of patriotic fervor and proud proclamations about “liberty and justice for all”—that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly retarded. Joshua and his mother, as petitioners here, deserve—but now are denied by this Court—the opportunity to have the facts of their case considered in the light of the constitutional protection that 42 U.S.C. §1983 is meant to provide.</p>

<p id="fc19e71a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 (2005), the Court concluded that there was no duty to provide protection even if state law required police to enforce restraining orders.</p>
<p id="fc19e71b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like <i>DeShaney</i>, the case had tragic facts. Jessica Gonzales obtained a restraining order limiting contact between her estranged husband and their three <span title="1140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1140">p. 1140</span>daughters. Colorado has a law requiring enforcement of restraining orders and the order itself included language mandating enforcement by the police. One night, Gonzales discovered that her three daughters were missing. She immediately suspected her husband had taken them and called the police. The police refused to help her. Five times that evening she contacted the police, including once by going to the station house, and each time they were unhelpful. Later that night, her husband killed the three girls and he died in a shootout with the police.</p>
<p id="fc19e71c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jessica Gonzales sued under the due process clause for the failure of the police to enforce the restraining order. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in an en banc decision, ruled in her favor and expressly distinguished <i>DeShaney</i>. The court explained that Gonzales’s claim was for procedural due process; the state law and the restraining order being written in mandatory language created a property interest and Gonzales was deprived of this property without due process of law. <i>DeShaney</i>, in contrast, was a substantive due process case.</p>
<p id="fc19e71d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, with Justice Scalia writing for the majority, reversed. The Court reaffirmed that there is a property interest only if there is an entitlement. The Court said that a “benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1286D_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1286D_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">56</a></span> The Court explained that police always have discretion as to how to enforce a law and prosecutors always have discretion as to whether to initiate a criminal action. Thus, the Court concluded that there is not a property interest for purposes of due process. Moreover, the Court noted that “it is by no means clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a ‘property’ interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause. Such a right would not, of course, resemble any traditional conception of property.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12875_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12875_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">57</a></span></p>
<p id="fc1a0d30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bottom line is that it does not matter whether the claim is called substantive or procedural due process, or whether the law is written in mandatory or discretionary terms. The government generally has no duty to provide protection from private inflicted harms. Only if the government literally creates the danger or a person is in government custody is there any constitutional duty for the government to provide protection. State and local governments may create duties and remedies under their law, but they do not exist under the Constitution.</p>

<p id="fc1a0d3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the 1960s, there was substantial criticism of the rights-privileges distinction as a basis for determining whether there was an interest requiring due process. In a classic article, Professor Charles Reich argued that the rights-privileges distinction is an anachronism in an era where people depend on government for so much that is essential for survival.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN128C8_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N128C8_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">62</a></span> Government benefits such as education, welfare, Social Security, licenses, and jobs are relied on by people and thus hold the same place in a person’s life as property traditionally occupied.</p>
<p id="fc1a344d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, Reich argued there is the same need to prevent arbitrary government action. He wrote, “Society today is built around entitlements. . . . Many of the most important of these entitlements now flow from government. . . . Such sources of security, whether private or public, are no longer regarded as luxuries or gratuities; to the recipients they are essentials, fully deserved, and in no sense a form of charity.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN128DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N128DB_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">63</a></span> Reich contended that the rights-privileges distinction should be discarded and that due process should be provided when the government terminates the “new property.”</p>

<p id="fc1a5b69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional issue to be decided, therefore, is the narrow one whether the Due Process Clause requires that the recipient be afforded an evidentiary hearing before the termination of benefits.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant does not contend that procedural due process is not applicable to the termination of welfare benefits. Such benefits are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them. Their termination involves state action that adjudicates important rights. The constitutional challenge cannot be answered by an argument that public assistance benefits are a “privilege” and not a “right.” Relevant constitutional restraints apply as much to the withdrawal of public assistance benefits as to disqualification for unemployment compensation; or to denial of a tax exemption; or to discharge from public employment. The extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient is influenced by the extent to which he may be “condemned to suffer grievous loss,” and depends upon whether the recipient’s interest in avoiding that loss outweighs the governmental interest in summary adjudication. Accordingly, “consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12927_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12927_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">64</a></span></p>
<p id="fc1a5b6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, of course, that some governmental benefits may be administratively terminated without affording the recipient a pre-termination evidentiary hearing. But we agree with the District Court that when welfare is discontinued, only a pre-termination evidentiary hearing provides the recipient with procedural due process. For qualified recipients, welfare provides the means to obtain essential food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Thus the crucial factor in this context—a factor not present in the case of the blacklisted government contractor, the discharged government employee, the taxpayer denied a tax exemption, or virtually anyone else whose governmental entitlements are ended—is that termination of aid pending resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an eligible recipient of the very means by which to live while he waits. Since he lacks independent resources, his situation becomes immediately desperate. <span title="1143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1143">p. 1143</span>His need to concentrate upon finding the means for daily subsistence, in turn, adversely affects his ability to seek redress from the welfare bureaucracy.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, important governmental interests are promoted by affording recipients a pre-termination evidentiary hearing. From its founding the Nation’s basic commitment has been to foster the dignity and well-being of all persons within its borders.

<p id="fc1a5b6e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public assistance, then, is not mere charity, but a means to “promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” The same governmental interests that counsel the provision of welfare, counsel as well its uninterrupted provision to those eligible to receive it; pre-termination evidentiary hearings are indispensable to that end.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant does not challenge the force of these considerations but argues that they are outweighed by countervailing governmental interests in conserving fiscal and administrative resources. These interests, the argument goes, justify the delay of any evidentiary hearing until after discontinuance of the grants. Summary adjudication protects the public fisc by stopping payments promptly upon discovery of reason to believe that a recipient is no longer eligible. Since most terminations are accepted without challenge, summary adjudication also conserves both the fisc and administrative time and energy by reducing the number of evidentiary hearings actually held.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b70-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the District Court, however, that these governmental interests are not overriding in the welfare context. The requirement of a prior hearing doubtless involves some greater expense, and the benefits paid to ineligible recipients pending decision at the hearing probably cannot be recouped, since these recipients are likely to be judgment-proof. But the State is not without weapons to minimize these increased costs. Much of the drain on fiscal and administrative resources can be reduced by developing procedures for prompt pre-termination hearings and by skillful use of personnel and facilities. Indeed, the very provision for a post-termination evidentiary hearing in New York’s Home Relief program is itself cogent evidence that the State recognizes the primacy of the public interest in correct eligibility determinations and therefore in the provision of procedural safeguards. Thus, the interest of the eligible recipient in uninterrupted receipt of public assistance, coupled with the State’s interest that his payments not be erroneously terminated, clearly outweighs the State’s competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens. As the District Court correctly concluded, “[t]he stakes are simply too high for the welfare recipient, and the possibility for honest error or irritable misjudgment too great, to allow termination of aid without giving the recipient a chance, if he so desires, to be fully informed of the case against him so that he may contest its basis and produce evidence in rebuttal.”</p>

<p id="fc1a5b72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also agree with the District Court, however, that the pre-termination hearing need not take the form of a judicial or quasi-judicial trial. We bear in mind that the statutory “fair hearing” will provide the recipient with a full administrative review. Accordingly, the pre-termination hearing has one function only: to produce an initial determination of the validity of the welfare department’s <span title="1144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1144">p. 1144</span>grounds for discontinuance of payments in order to protect a recipient against an erroneous termination of his benefits. Thus, a complete record and a comprehensive opinion, which would serve primarily to facilitate judicial review and to guide future decisions, need not be provided at the pre-termination stage. We recognize, too, that both welfare authorities and recipients have an interest in relatively speedy resolution of questions of eligibility, that they are used to dealing with one another informally, and that some welfare departments have very burdensome caseloads. These considerations justify the limitation of the pre-termination hearing to minimum procedural safeguards, adapted to the particular characteristics of welfare recipients, and to the limited nature of the controversies to be resolved. We wish to add that we, no less than the dissenters, recognize the importance of not imposing upon the States or the Federal Government in this developing field of law any procedural requirements beyond those demanded by rudimentary due process.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.” The hearing must be “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” In the present context these principles require that a recipient have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination, and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.</p>

<p id="fc1a5b75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the last half century the United States, along with many, perhaps most, other nations of the world, has moved far toward becoming a welfare state, that is, a nation that for one reason or another taxes its most affluent people to help support, feed, clothe, and shelter its less fortunate citizens. The result is that today more than nine million men, women, and children in the United States receive some kind of state or federally financed public assistance in the form of allowances or gratuities, generally paid them periodically, usually by the week, month, or quarter. Since these gratuities are paid on the basis of need, the list of recipients is not static, and some people go off the lists and others are added from time to time. These ever-changing lists put a constant administrative burden on government and it certainly could not have reasonably anticipated that this burden would include the additional procedural expense imposed by the Court today.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more than a million names on the relief rolls in New York, and the more than nine million names on the rolls of all the 50 States were not put there at random. The names are there because state welfare officials believed that those people were eligible for assistance. Probably in the officials’ haste to make out the lists many names were put there erroneously in order to alleviate immediate suffering, and undoubtedly some people are drawing relief who are not entitled under the law to do so. Doubtless some draw relief checks from time to time who know they are not eligible, either because they are not actually in need or for some other reason. Many of those who thus draw undeserved gratuities are without sufficient property to enable the government to collect back from them any money they wrongfully receive. But the Court today holds that it would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to stop paying those people weekly or monthly allowances unless the government first affords them a full “evidentiary hearing” even though welfare officials are persuaded that the recipients are not rightfully entitled to receive a penny under the law. In other words, although some recipients might be on the lists for payment wholly <span title="1145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1145">p. 1145</span>because of deliberate fraud on their part, the Court holds that the government is helpless and must continue, until after an evidentiary hearing, to pay money that it does not owe, never has owed, and never could owe. I do not believe there is any provision in our Constitution that should thus paralyze the government’s efforts to protect itself against making payments to people who are not entitled to them.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court apparently feels that this decision will benefit the poor and needy. In my judgment the eventual result will be just the opposite. [T]oday’s decision requires only the opportunity to have the benefit of counsel at the administrative hearing, but it is difficult to believe that the same reasoning process would not require the appointment of counsel, for otherwise the right to counsel is a meaningless one since these people are too poor to hire their own advocates. Thus the end result of today’s decision may well be that the government, once it decides to give welfare benefits, cannot reverse that decision until the recipient has had the benefits of full administrative and judicial review, including, of course, the opportunity to present his case to this Court. Since this process will usually entail a delay of several years, the inevitable result of such a constitutionally imposed burden will be that the government will not put a claimant on the rolls initially until it has made an exhaustive investigation to determine his eligibility. While this Court will perhaps have insured that no needy person will be taken off the rolls without a full “due process” proceeding, it will also have insured that many will never get on the rolls, or at least that they will remain destitute during the lengthy proceedings followed to determine initial eligibility.</p>
<p id="fc1a5b78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons I dissent from the Court’s holding. The operation of a welfare state is a new experiment for our Nation. For this reason, among others, I feel that new experiments in carrying out a welfare program should not be frozen into our constitutional structure. They should be left, as are other legislative determinations, to the Congress and the legislatures that the people elect to make our laws.</p>

The question then becomes, if the rights-privileges distinction is not to be used in defining “liberty” and “property,” how is the Court to decide if such an interest is present? This is examined in the following sections. The constant question is whether the Court has resurrected the rights-privileges distinction not expressly but in the way in which it has defined property and liberty.</p>

<p id="fc1a8294-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1968 the respondent, David Roth, was hired for his first teaching job as assistant professor of political science at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh. He was hired for a fixed term of one academic year. The notice of his faculty appointment specified that his employment would begin on September 1, 1968, and would end on June 30, 1969. The respondent completed that term. But he was informed that he would not be rehired for the next academic year.</p>
<p id="fc1a8295-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent had no tenure rights to continued employment. Under Wisconsin statutory law a state university teacher can acquire tenure as a “permanent” employee only after four years of year-to-year employment. Having acquired tenure, a teacher is entitled to continued employment “during efficiency and good behavior.” A relatively new teacher without tenure, however, is under Wisconsin law entitled to nothing beyond his one-year appointment. There are no statutory or administrative standards defining eligibility for re-employment. State law thus clearly leaves the decision whether to rehire a nontenured teacher for another year to the unfettered discretion of university officials.</p>
<p id="fc1a8296-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conformance with these Rules, the President of Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh informed the respondent before February 1, 1969, that he would not be rehired for the 1969-1970 academic year. He gave the respondent no reason for the decision and no opportunity to challenge it at any sort of hearing.</p>
<p id="fc1a8297-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent then brought this action in Federal District Court alleging that the decision not to rehire him for the next year infringed his Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>

When protected interests are implicated, the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount. But the range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”Liberty” and “property” are broad and majestic terms. They are among the “[g]reat [constitutional] concepts . . . purposely left to gather meaning from experience. . . . [T]hey relate to the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this Nation knew too well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged.” For that reason, the Court has fully and finally rejected the wooden distinction between “rights” and “privileges” that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process rights. The Court has also made clear that the property interests protected by procedural due process extend well beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money. By <span title="1147" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1147">p. 1147</span>the same token, the Court has required due process protection for deprivations of liberty beyond the sort of formal constraints imposed by the criminal process.</p>

<p id="fc1aa9ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment], the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized . . . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Meyer v. Nebraska. In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of “liberty” must be broad indeed.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There might be cases in which a State refused to re-employ a person under such circumstances that interests in liberty would be implicated. But this is not such a case.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community. It did not base the nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of dishonesty, or immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case. In such a case, due process would accord an opportunity to refute the charge before University officials. In the present case, however, there is no suggestion whatever that the respondent’s “good name, reputation, honor, or integrity” is at stake.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, there is no suggestion that the State, in declining to re-employ the respondent, imposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities. The State, for example, did not invoke any regulations to bar the respondent from all other public employment in state universities. Had it done so, this, again, would be a different case.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hence, on the record before us, all that clearly appears is that the respondent was not rehired for one year at one university.

<p id="fc1aa9b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment’s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits. These interests—property interests—may take many forms. Certain attributes of “property” interests protected by procedural due process emerge from these decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily <span title="1148" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1148">p. 1148</span>undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law—rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as the welfare recipients’ “property” interest in welfare payments was created and defined by statutory terms, so the respondent’s “property” interest in employment at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh was created and defined by the terms of his appointment. Those terms secured his interest in employment up to June 30, 1969. But the important fact in this case is that they specifically provided that the respondent’s employment was to terminate on June 30. They did not provide for contract renewal absent “sufficient cause.” Indeed, they made no provision for renewal whatsoever.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the terms of the respondent’s appointment secured absolutely no interest in re-employment for the next year. They supported absolutely no possible claim of entitlement to re-employment. Nor, significantly, was there any state statute or University rule or policy that secured his interest in re-employment or that created any legitimate claim to it. In these circumstances, the respondent surely had an abstract concern in being rehired, but he did not have a property interest sufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing when they declined to renew his contract of employment.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent was hired as an assistant professor of political science at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh for the 1968-1969 academic year. During the course of that year he was told that he would not be rehired for the next academic term, but he was never told why. In this case, he asserts that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution entitled him to a statement of reasons and a hearing on the University’s decision not to rehire him for another year.</p>
<p id="fc1aa9b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would go further than the Court does in defining the terms “liberty” and “property.” The prior decisions of this Court, discussed at length in the opinion of the Court, establish a principle that is as obvious as it is compelling—i.e., federal and state governments and governmental agencies are restrained by the Constitution from acting arbitrarily with respect to employment opportunities that they either offer or control. Hence, it is now firmly established that whether or not a private employer is free to act capriciously or unreasonably with respect to employment practices, at least absent statutory or contractual controls, a government employer is different. The government may only act fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has long maintained that “the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [Fourteenth] Amendment to secure.” Truax v. Raich (1915). It has also established that the fact that an employee has no contract guaranteeing work for a specific future period does not mean that as the result of action by the government he may be “discharged at any time, for any reason or for no reason.”</p>
<p id="fc1ad0ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment. <span title="1149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1149">p. 1149</span>This is the “property” right that I believe is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and that cannot be denied “without due process of law.” And it is also liberty—liberty to work—which is the “very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity” secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be argued that to provide procedural due process to all public employees or prospective employees would place an intolerable burden on the machinery of government. Cf. Goldberg v. Kelly, supra. The short answer to that argument is that it is not burdensome to give reasons when reasons exist. Whenever an application for employment is denied, an employee is discharged, or a decision not to rehire an employee is made, there should be some reason for the decision. It can scarcely be argued that government would be crippled by a requirement that the reason be communicated to the person most directly affected by the government’s action.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Goldberg v. Kelly and Board of Regents v. Roth reflect very different approaches in defining whether there is a property interest. One approach to defining entitlement would find a property interest if there is an important benefit regardless of the content of the state law. An alternative definition, however, would find a property interest only if the state law creates a reasonable expectation to receipt of a benefit, regardless of the importance of the interest.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each definition has problems. If the existence of property is determined solely by the importance of the benefit, there seems no principled way to decide which government benefits are sufficiently significant to constitute property. The government provides a vast array of services and programs that people rely on. How is the Court to decide which are important enough to constitute property and require due process when they are ended?</p>
<p id="fc1ad0ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defining property based on whether the law creates a reasonable expectation to continued receipt of a benefit solves this problem because it provides a basis for deciding what constitutes property apart from the importance of the interest. But it creates a different major difficulty: Could the state simply deny the existence of property by expressly stating that individuals should have no expectation to continued receipt? In other words, if property is defined by expectations, the state can defeat property interests by making it clear that people should have no expectations. In essence, the rights-privileges distinction is recreated under a different label; the state could deny a property interest merely by making it clear that the benefit or program was something that the government could terminate at any point. Indeed, the more arbitrary the government is, the less there can be reasonable expectations to continued receipt of the benefit and the less likely there will be a requirement for due process.</p>

<p id="fc1ad0cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To this day, the Court has not resolved this tension. The Court generally has adopted the second approach to defining property—that is, as a reasonable expectation to continued receipt of a benefit. Yet the Court has been inconsistent in its willingness to embrace the consequence that the government then can deny a property interest merely by informing people that they should not expect the benefit to continue.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary area where the Court has struggled with defining property is in the context of deciding when government employment constitutes an entitlement. <i>Roth</i>, itself, involved this issue.

Sinderman was a professor at Odessa Junior College, and although the college did not have a tenure system, its faculty guide stated that it “wishes the faculty member to feel that he has permanent tenure as long as his teaching services are satisfactory and as long as he displays a cooperative attitude.” The Court said that the absence of a formal tenure system was not dispositive in deciding whether there was a property interest. The Court explained that the teacher had raised “a genuine issue as to his interest in continued employment, [which] though not secured by a formal contractual tenure provision, was secured by a no less binding understanding fostered by the college administration.”</p>
<p id="fc1ad0d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, as described above, does this approach mean that the government can prevent there from being a property interest in a government job simply by making it clear to the employees that they should have no expectation of the job continuing? Justice Rehnquist suggested this in Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974). The issue in <i>Arnett</i> was whether the government could fire a nonprobationary employee without a pretermination hearing. There was no majority opinion by the Court, but six of the justices recognized that there was a property interest in the job. The ruling was that there was not a denial of due process because the government provided a pretermination review and a post-termination hearing.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Stewart, would not have found a property interest requiring due process. Rehnquist emphasized that the property interest in the job is only that which the statute provides. He also wrote that “where the grant of a substantive right is inextricably intertwined with the limitations on the procedures which are to be employed in determining that right, a litigant in the position of appellee must take the bitter with the sweet.” The other six justices appeared to reject this and objected that the Rehnquist “view misconceives the origin of the right to procedural due process. That right is conferred, not by legislative grace, but by constitutional guarantee.”</p>
<p id="fc1ad0d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This view appeared to attract support from a majority of the Supreme Court in Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341 (1976). The plaintiff, a city police officer, was considered a “permanent employee” under state law. Nonetheless, the federal district court found that as a matter of state law, the police officer “held his position at the will and pleasure of the city.” Therefore, the Court concluded that he did not have a property interest in his job and that he was not entitled to due process with regard to his termination. This means that the government can prevent there from being a property interest simply by making it clear that it retains the right to fire the individual at will. As such, it seems little different from the rights-privileges distinction that the Court so expressly repudiated in cases like <i>Goldberg</i> and <i>Roth.</i></p>
<p id="fc1ad0d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent to <i>Bishop</i>, the Court has clarified that if there is a property right, the issue of what procedures are required is a matter of federal constitutional law to be decided by the courts. In Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the Supreme Court considered a state civil service law that provided that employees were entitled only to post-termination administrative review. There was no dispute that the law created a property interest in that it required that employees only be terminated if there was “cause.” The Court then said that due process required a predischarge opportunity to be heard <span title="1151" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1151">p. 1151</span>and that state law could not alter this requirement. The Court said that it was “settled that the bitter with the sweet approach misconceives the constitutional guarantee” and that when there is a property interest, the Constitution—and not the state law—determines the procedures to be followed.</p>
<p id="fc1ad0d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Loudermill</i>, however, only addresses the question of what procedures are required when there has been a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, which is addressed below. <i>Loudermill</i> does not overrule or change <i>Bishop</i>’s holding: In deciding if there is a property interest in a government job, the relevant inquiry is the expectations created by the law and customs surrounding the position.</p>

The difficult question arises as to what other interests fit under the rubric of liberty and require due process. Again, there are two different ways for the Court to approach this and define liberty. One would be for the Court to determine what is “liberty” based on the importance of the interest at stake. The other way would be for the Court to determine whether there is a liberty interest based on the expectations engendered by state law. Again, both are present in the case law. Two examples illustrate this: (1) Are harms to reputation a liberty interest? (2) When do prisoners have liberty interests?</p>

<p id="fc1af7f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal by various administrators of the Columbus, Ohio, Public School System (CPSS) challenges the judgment of a three-judge federal court, declaring that appellees—various high school students in the CPSS—were denied due process of law contrary to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment in that they were temporarily suspended from their high schools without a hearing either prior to suspension or within a reasonable time thereafter, and enjoining the administrators to remove all references to such suspensions from the students’ records.</p>

<p id="fc1af7f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ohio law, Rev. Code Ann. §3313.64 (1972), provides for free education to all children between the ages of six and 21. Section 3313.66 of the Code empowers the principal of an Ohio public school to suspend a pupil for misconduct for up <span title="1152" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1152">p. 1152</span>to 10 days or to expel him. In either case, he must notify the student’s parents within 24 hours and state the reasons for his action. A pupil who is expelled, or his parents, may appeal the decision to the Board of Education and in connection therewith shall be permitted to be heard at the board meeting. The Board may reinstate the pupil following the hearing. No similar procedure is provided in §3313.66 or any other provision of state law for a suspended student. Aside from a regulation tracking the statute, at the time of the imposition of the suspensions in this case the CPSS itself had not issued any written procedure applicable to suspensions. Nor, so far as the record reflects, had any of the individual high schools involved in this case. Each, however, had formally or informally described the conduct for which suspension could be imposed.</p>
<p id="fc1af7f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nine named appellees, each of whom alleged that he or she had been suspended from public high school in Columbus for up to 10 days without a hearing pursuant to §3313.66, filed an action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Columbus Board of Education and various administrators of the CPSS.</p>

<p id="fc1af7f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, appellants contend that because there is no constitutional right to an education at public expense, the Due Process Clause does not protect against expulsions from the public school system. This position misconceives the nature of the issue and is refuted by prior decisions. The Fourteenth Amendment forbids the State to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Protected interests in property are normally “not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined” by an independent source such as state statutes or rules entitling the citizen to certain benefits. Board of Regents v. Roth (1972).</p>
<p id="fc1af7f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, on the basis of state law, appellees plainly had legitimate claims of entitlement to a public education. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.48 and 3313.64 direct local authorities to provide a free education to all residents between five and 21 years of age, and a compulsory-attendance law requires attendance for a school year of not less than 32 weeks. It is true that §3313.66 of the Code permits school principals to suspend students for up to 10 days; but suspensions may not be imposed without any grounds whatsoever. All of the schools had their own rules specifying the grounds for expulsion or suspension. Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of appellees’ class generally, Ohio may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct absent fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred. [T]he State is constrained to recognize a student’s legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause and which may not be taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by that Clause.</p>
<p id="fc1af7f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Due Process Clause also forbids arbitrary deprivations of liberty. “Where a person’s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him,” the minimal requirements of the Clause must be satisfied. Wisconsin v. Constantineau (1971). School authorities here suspended appellees from school for periods of up to 10 days based on charges of misconduct. If sustained and recorded, those charges could seriously damage the students’ standing with their fellow pupils and their teachers as well as <span title="1153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1153">p. 1153</span>interfere with later opportunities for higher education and employment. It is apparent that the claimed right of the State to determine unilaterally and without process whether that misconduct has occurred immediately collides with the requirements of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc1af7fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A short suspension is, of course, a far milder deprivation than expulsion. But, “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” Brown v. Board of Education (1954), and the total exclusion from the educational process for more than a trivial period, and certainly if the suspension is for 10 days, is a serious event in the life of the suspended child. Neither the property interest in educational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation, which is also implicated, is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by any procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.</p>

<p id="fc1af7fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Once it is determined that due process applies, the question remains what process is due.” The difficulty is that our schools are vast and complex. Some modicum of discipline and order is essential if the educational function is to be performed. Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action. Suspension is considered not only to be a necessary tool to maintain order but a valuable educational device. The prospect of imposing elaborate hearing requirements in every suspension case is viewed with great concern, and many school authorities may well prefer the untrammeled power to act unilaterally, unhampered by rules about notice and hearing. But it would be a strange disciplinary system in an educational institution if no communication was sought by the disciplinarian with the student in an effort to inform him of his dereliction and to let him tell his side of the story in order to make sure that an injustice is not done. “[F]airness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights. . . .” “Secrecy is not congenial to truth-seeking and self-righteousness gives too slender an assurance of tightness. No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.”</p>
<p id="fc1af7fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not believe that school authorities must be totally free from notice and hearing requirements if their schools are to operate with acceptable efficiency. Students facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for protection of the Due Process Clause, and due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.</p>
<p id="fc1af7fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding as we do, we do not believe that we have imposed procedures on school disciplinarians which are inappropriate in a classroom setting. Instead we have imposed requirements which are, if anything, less than a fair-minded school principal would impose upon himself in order to avoid unfair suspensions.</p>

The Court holds for the first time that the federal courts, rather than educational officials and state legislatures, have the authority to determine the rules applicable to routine classroom discipline of children and teenagers in the public schools. It justifies this unprecedented intrusion into the process of elementary and secondary education by identifying a new constitutional right: the right of a student not to be suspended for as much as a single day without notice and a due process hearing either before or promptly following the suspension. In my view, a student’s interest in education is not infringed by a suspension within the limited period prescribed by Ohio law. Moreover, to the extent that there may be some arguable infringement, it is too speculative, transitory, and insubstantial to justify imposition of a constitutional rule.</p>

In late 1972 they agreed to combine their efforts for the purpose of alerting local area merchants to possible shoplifters who might be operating during the Christmas season. In early December petitioners distributed to approximately 800 merchants in the Louisville metropolitan area a “flyer,” which began as follows:</p>

These persons have been arrested during 1971 and 1972 or have been active in various criminal fields in high density shopping areas.</p>
</div>

<p id="fc1b1f1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The flyer consisted of five pages of “mug shot” photos, arranged alphabetically. Each page was headed: <span class="epub-small-caps">november 1972 city of louisville jefferson</span> <span title="1155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1155">p. 1155</span>[<span class="epub-small-caps">and</span>] <span class="epub-small-caps">county police departments’ active shoplifters</span>. In approximately the center of page 2 there appeared photos and the name of the respondent, Edward Charles Davis III.</p>
<p id="fc1b1f1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent appeared on the flyer because on June 14, 1971, he had been arrested in Louisville on a charge of shoplifting. He had been arraigned on this charge in September 1971, and, upon his plea of not guilty, the charge had been “filed away with leave [to reinstate],” a disposition which left the charge outstanding. Thus, at the time petitioners caused the flyer to be prepared and circulated respondent had been charged with shoplifting but his guilt or innocence of that offense had never been resolved. Shortly after circulation of the flyer the charge against respondent was finally dismissed by a judge of the Louisville Police Court.</p>
<p id="fc1b462f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent’s due process claim is grounded upon his assertion that the flyer, and in particular the phrase “Active Shoplifters” appearing at the head of the page upon which his name and photograph appear, impermissibly deprived him of some “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. His complaint asserted that the “active shoplifter” designation would inhibit him from entering business establishments for fear of being suspected of shoplifting and possibly apprehended, and would seriously impair his future employment opportunities.</p>
<p id="fc1b4630-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words “liberty” and “property” as used in the Fourteenth Amendment do not in terms single out reputation as a candidate for special protection over and above other interests that may be protected by state law. While we have in a number of our prior cases pointed out the frequently drastic effect of the “stigma” which may result from defamation by the government in a variety of contexts, this line of cases does not establish the proposition that reputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as employment, is either “liberty” or “property” by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fc1b4631-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion is quite consistent with our most recent holding in this area, Goss v. Lopez (1975), that suspension from school based upon charges of misconduct could trigger the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the Court noted that charges of misconduct could seriously damage the student’s reputation, it also took care to point out that Ohio law conferred a right upon all children to attend school, and that the act of the school officials suspending the student there involved resulted in a denial or deprivation of that right.</p>
<p id="fc1b4632-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kentucky law does not extend to respondent any legal guarantee of present enjoyment of reputation which has been altered as a result of petitioners’ actions. Rather his interest in reputation is simply one of a number which the State may protect against injury by virtue of its tort law, providing a forum for vindication of those interests by means of damages actions. And any harm or injury to that interest, even where as here inflicted by an officer of the State, does not result in a deprivation of any “liberty” or “property” recognized by state or federal law, nor has it worked any change of respondent’s status as theretofore recognized under the State’s laws. For these reasons we hold that the interest in reputation asserted in this case is neither “liberty” nor “property” guaranteed against state deprivation without due process of law.</p>
<p id="fc1b4633-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent in this case cannot assert denial of any right vouchsafed to him by the State and thereby protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p id="fc1b4635-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent. The Court today holds that police officials, acting in their official capacities as law enforcers, may on their own initiative and without trial constitutionally condemn innocent individuals as criminals and thereby brand them with one of the most stigmatizing and debilitating labels in our society. If there are no constitutional restraints on such oppressive behavior, the safeguards constitutionally accorded an accused in a criminal trial are rendered a sham, and no individual can feel secure that he will not be arbitrarily singled out for similar ex parte punishment by those primarily charged with fair enforcement of the law. The Court accomplishes this result by excluding a person’s interest in his good name and reputation from all constitutional protection, regardless of the character of or necessity for the government’s actions. The result, which is demonstrably inconsistent with our prior case law and unduly restrictive in its construction of our precious Bill of Rights, is one in which I cannot concur.</p>
<p id="fc1b4636-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court now implicitly repudiates a substantial body of case law and finds no such constitutionally cognizable interest in a person’s reputation, thus foreclosing any inquiry into the procedural protections accorded that interest in a given situation.</p>
<p id="fc1b4637-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have always thought that one of this Court’s most important roles is to provide a formidable bulwark against governmental violation of the constitutional safeguards securing in our free society the legitimate expectations of every person to innate human dignity and sense of worth. It is a regrettable abdication of that role and a saddening denigration of our majestic Bill of Rights when the Court tolerates arbitrary and capricious official conduct branding an individual as a criminal without compliance with constitutional procedures designed to ensure the fair and impartial ascertainment of criminal culpability. Today’s decision must surely be a shortlived aberration.</p>

<p id="fc1b463a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In defining “liberty,” the Court has struggled most with cases involving prisoners. Over the past quarter of a century, the Court has shifted its approach several times. Initially, the Court indicated that prisoners have a liberty interest when an important matter is at stake. The Court, however, later moved away from this approach and repeatedly held that liberty interests for prisoners are a function of statutes and regulations; prisoners have liberty interests when the relevant statutes and regulations create them. However, most recently in Sandin v. Conner, the Supreme Court backed away from this approach and held that regardless of the content of statutes and regulations, there is a liberty interest only if there is a significant deprivation of freedom that is atypical to the usual conditions of confinement.</p>
<p id="fc1b463b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), the Supreme Court held that revocation of parole is a deprivation of liberty that requires the provision of due process. The Court emphasized the importance of the interest to the individual. When out on parole, an individual can be “gainfully employed and is free to be <span title="1157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1157">p. 1157</span>with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life.” This, of course, is taken away if parole is revoked, and the Supreme Court found that there was a liberty interest in remaining on parole because ending parole “inflicts a grievous loss on the parolee and often on others.” In other words, <i>Morrissey</i> found a liberty interest based on the significance of the interest to the parolee, rather than focusing on the specifics of the state law involved.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, a year later, in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), the Supreme Court ruled that the revocation of probation is a deprivation of liberty requiring due process. The Court explained that “revocation of probation . . . is constitutionally indistinguishable from the revocation of parole.”</p>
<p id="fc1b6d4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Soon after these cases, however, the Court shifted its approach and based its determination of whether there is a liberty interest on the content of the statutes or rules, rather than on the importance of the interest to the individual. For example, in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), the Supreme Court held that prisoners have a liberty interest in “good time credits” awarded under state law. The Court explained that although a state need not give prisoners good time credits, “the State having created the right to good time . . ., the prisoner’s interest has real substance and is sufficiently embraced within Fourteenth Amendment liberty to entitle him to those minimum procedures . . . required by the Due Process Clause to insure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily abrogated.” The Court said that a “person’s liberty is equally protected, even when the liberty itself is a statutory creation of the state.” In other words, <i>Wolff</i> found a liberty interest based on the expectations created by state law, rather than based on the significance of the credits for the individual prisoner.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court applied <i>Wolff</i> in Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976), where the Supreme Court held that prisoners do not have a liberty interest in remaining in a minimum-security facility, as opposed to a maximum-security facility, unless the state or federal law clearly creates such an expectation. A prisoner argued that a transfer from a minimum-security facility to a maximum-security facility obviously meant that he had less liberty. The Court disagreed and declared, “We reject at the outset the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause. . . . That life in one prison is much more disagreeable than in another does not in itself signify that a Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest is implicated.”</p>
<p id="fc1b6d4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In dissent, Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall, disagreed and argued that “neither the Bill of Rights nor the laws of sovereign States create the liberty which the Due Process Clause protects. . . . It is . . . basic freedom which the Due Process Clause protects, rather than the particular rights or privileges conferred by specific laws or regulations.” The conflict between the dissent and the majority was over how to determine when a prisoner has a liberty interest. For the dissent, a deprivation of liberty occurs when a prisoner is denied important freedoms regardless of the content of statutes or regulations. For the majority, a deprivation of liberty occurs if there is the removal of a freedom created by a statute or regulation.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Wolff</i> and <i>Meachum</i>, the question becomes what statutes and rules create liberty interests? The Supreme Court focused on whether a law or rule was sufficiently mandatory so as to create a reasonable expectation on the part of the prisoner. For example, in Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the existence of a <span title="1158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1158">p. 1158</span>parole system is not enough to create a liberty interest in parole; rather, there must be specific requirements in the law that transform parole from a mere hope to an entitlement under particular circumstances. The Court found that Nebraska created a liberty interest in parole because state law allowed the denial of parole only under specific statutorily defined reasons and because the law allowed denial only if there were specific findings to support the decision. The Court emphasized that the word “shall” in the state law created a legitimate expectation to release on parole unless one of the statute’s exceptions was met.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contrast in approach between Morrissey v. Brewster and <i>Greenholtz</i> is striking. <i>Morrissey</i> found a liberty interest in parole because it determines a person’s freedom. <i>Greenholtz</i> held that there is a liberty interest in parole only if the state law makes it one by its mandatory language.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Greenholtz</i> approach was followed in a series of cases spanning over two decades. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a prisoner has a liberty interest in not being placed in disciplinary segregation or being transferred to another, more restrictive facility, only if state law creates such an expectation. In Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), the Supreme Court found that a prison had to provide due process before placing a prisoner in administrative segregation because state law had created such a liberty interest. The Court explained that generally prisoners have no liberty interest in being confined in one place as opposed to another. But the Court said that the state had done more than issue procedural guidelines; it had used “language of an unmistakably mandatory character” and made it clear that a prisoner would not be placed in administrative segregation “absent specific substantive predicates.”</p>
<p id="fc1b6d53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458 (1981), the Supreme Court found that a prisoner did not have a liberty interest in having a review of a request for commutation of a life sentence. The Court explained that state law did not create an expectation that sentences would be commuted, even though in practice the review board commuted most of the life sentences in the cases it considered. The Court said that the Connecticut law governing commutation of sentences did not provide “particularized standards or criteria [to] guide the State’s decisionmakers.”</p>
<p id="fc1b6d54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, in deciding whether a prisoner has a liberty interest, the Court would examine the statutes and regulations governing the prison. If they were written in mandatory language and created a legitimate expectation of a benefit, then the Court would find a liberty interest. The Court expressly stated this in Kentucky Department of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989), where it declared, “We have . . . articulated a requirement . . . that the regulations contain explicitly mandatory language, i.e., specific directives to the decision maker that if the regulations’ substantive predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow, in order to create a liberty interest.” In <i>Thompson</i>, the Supreme Court held that prisoners in Kentucky did not have a liberty interest in visitation, even visitation from family members, because the regulations “lack the requisite relevant mandatory language.”</p>
<p id="fc1b6d55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although in all of these cases the Court emphasized the content of the laws and regulations, there were some cases that did not fit this pattern and where the Court found a liberty interest primarily based on the importance of the interest to the prisoner. For example, in Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980), the Court held that a prisoner is deprived of liberty when transferred from a prison to a mental hospital. The Court, in part, focused on the content of the state’s prison regulations and concluded that they created an expectation that <span title="1159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1159">p. 1159</span>the inmate would be kept in prison facilities and not moved to a mental hospital without a proven need for treatment. But the Court also emphasized that there was a loss of liberty because confinement to a mental hospital likely would mean the imposition of mandatory treatment and also a realistic possibility of stigma. The clear implication of <i>Vitek</i> is that prisoners have a liberty interest in not being transferred to a mental hospital regardless of the content of the specific laws or regulations for that prison.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, in Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990), the Supreme Court recognized that prisoners have a liberty interest in avoiding the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medications. The Court made it clear that independent of any state law or regulation, prisoners have a liberty interest in being free from the involuntary administration of psychotropic drugs. The Court found that the state’s law met the requirements for procedural and substantive due process before the administration of these drugs. Prison regulations required that the prisoner be given at least 24 hours’ notice before the administration of this medication, and it provided the opportunity for a hearing before health professionals and prison officials. The Court found that this was procedurally adequate to meet the requirements of due process.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, up until June 1995, a liberty interest for prisoners could be found either if the prison statutes and regulations were written in mandatory language and created such an interest or if the interest was so important that the Court would deem it to be a part of liberty regardless of the content of the statutes or regulations. In Sandin v. Conner, however, the Court called into question the approach of finding liberty interests based on the content of statutes and regulations and shifted back to an approach that determines liberty interests based on the importance of the interest involved.</p>

<p id="fc1b6d5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DeMont Conner was convicted of numerous state crimes, including murder, kidnaping, robbery, and burglary, for which he is currently serving an indeterminate sentence of 30 years to life in a Hawaii prison. He was confined in the Halawa Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in central Oahu. In August 1987, a prison officer escorted him from his cell to the module program area. The officer subjected Conner to a strip search, complete with an inspection of the rectal area. Conner retorted with angry and foul language directed at the officer. Eleven days later he received notice that he had been charged with disciplinary infractions. The notice charged Conner with “high misconduct” for using physical interference to impair a correctional function, and “low moderate misconduct” for using abusive or obscene language and for harassing employees.</p>
<p id="fc1b6d5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conner appeared before an adjustment committee on August 28, 1987. The committee refused Conner’s request to present witnesses at the hearing, stating that “[w]itnesses were unavailable due to move [sic] to the medium facility and being short staffed on the modules.” At the conclusion of proceedings, the <span title="1160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1160">p. 1160</span>committee determined that Conner was guilty of the alleged misconduct. It sentenced him to 30 days’ disciplinary segregation in the Special Holding Unit. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the judgment. It concluded that Conner had a liberty interest in remaining free from disciplinary segregation and that there was a disputed question of fact with respect to whether Conner received all of the process due under this Court’s pronouncement in Wolff v. McDonnell. The Court of Appeals based its conclusion on a prison regulation that instructs the committee to find guilt when a charge of misconduct is supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p id="fc1b6d5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court reviewed the shift from cases looking at the importance of the interest for the prisoner to those considering the content of the prison regulations and stated:] no longer did inmates need to rely on a showing that they had suffered a “grievous loss” of liberty retained even after sentenced to terms of imprisonment. For the Court had ceased to examine the “nature” of the interest with respect to interests allegedly created by the State. In a series of cases since <i>Hewitt</i>, the Court has wrestled with the language of intricate, often rather routine prison guidelines to determine whether mandatory language and substantive predicates created an enforceable expectation that the State would produce a particular outcome with respect to the prisoner’s conditions of confinement.</p>
<p id="fc1b9470-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By shifting the focus of the liberty interest inquiry to one based on the language of a particular regulation, and not the nature of the deprivation, the Court encouraged prisoners to comb regulations in search of mandatory language on which to base entitlements to various state-conferred privileges. Such a conclusion may be entirely sensible in the ordinary task of construing a statute defining rights and remedies available to the general public. It is a good deal less sensible in the case of a prison regulation primarily designed to guide correctional officials in the administration of a prison. Not only are such regulations not designed to confer rights on inmates, but the result of the negative implication jurisprudence is not to require the prison officials to follow the negative implication drawn from the regulation, but is instead to attach procedural protections that may be of quite a different nature.</p>
<p id="fc1b9471-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hewitt</i> has produced at least two undesirable effects. First, it creates disincentives for States to codify prison management procedures in the interest of uniform treatment. Prison administrators need be concerned with the safety of the staff and inmate population. Ensuring that welfare often leads prison administrators to curb the discretion of staff on the front line who daily encounter prisoners hostile to the authoritarian structure of the prison environment. Such guidelines are not set forth solely to benefit the prisoner. They also aspire to instruct subordinate employees how to exercise discretion vested by the State in the warden, and to confine the authority of prison personnel in order to avoid widely different treatment of similar incidents. The approach embraced by <i>Hewitt</i> discourages this desirable development: States may avoid creation of “liberty” interests by having scarcely any regulations, or by conferring standardless discretion on correctional personnel.</p>
<p id="fc1b9472-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the <i>Hewitt</i> approach has led to the involvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons, often squandering judicial resources <span title="1161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1161">p. 1161</span>with little offsetting benefit to anyone. In so doing, it has run counter to the view expressed in several of our cases that federal courts ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials trying to manage a volatile environment. Such flexibility is especially warranted in the fine-tuning of the ordinary incidents of prison life, a common subject of prisoner claims since <i>Hewitt.</i> See, e.g., Klos v. Haskell (CA2 1995) (claiming liberty interest in right to participate in “shock program”—a type of boot camp for inmates); Segal v. Biller (CA9 1994) (unpublished) (claiming liberty interest in a waiver of the travel limit imposed on prison furloughs); Burgin v. Nix (CA8 1990) (claiming liberty interest in receiving a tray lunch rather than a sack lunch); Spruytte v. Walters (CA6 1985) (finding liberty interest in receiving a paperback dictionary due to a rule that states a prisoner “may receive any book . . . which does not present a threat to the order or security of the institution”).</p>
<p id="fc1b9473-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the above discussion, we believe that the search for a negative implication from mandatory language in prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The time has come to return to the due process principles we believe were correctly established and applied in <i>Wolff</i> and <i>Meachum.</i> This case, though concededly punitive, does not present a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of Conner’s indeterminate sentence. Conner’s confinement did not exceed similar, but totally discretionary, confinement in either duration or degree of restriction. Indeed, the conditions at Halawa involve significant amounts of “lockdown time” even for inmates in the general population. Based on a comparison between inmates inside and outside disciplinary segregation, the State’s actions in placing him there for 30 days did not work a major disruption in his environment.</p>

<p id="fc1b9475-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The specific question in this case is whether a particular punishment that, among other things, segregates an inmate from the general prison population for violating a disciplinary rule deprives the inmate of “liberty” within the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The majority, asking whether that punishment “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,” concludes that it does not do so. The majority’s reasoning, however, particularly when read in light of this Court’s precedents, seems to me to lead to the opposite conclusion. And, for that reason, I dissent.</p>
<p id="fc1b9476-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we apply these pre-existing principles to the relevant facts before us, it seems fairly clear, as the Ninth Circuit found, that the prison punishment here at issue deprived Conner of constitutionally protected “liberty.” For one thing, the punishment worked a fairly major change in Conner’s conditions. In the absence of the punishment, Conner, like other inmates in Halawa’s general prison population, would have left his cell and worked, taken classes, or mingled with others for eight hours each day. As a result of disciplinary segregation, however, Conner, for 30 days, had to spend his entire time alone in his cell (with the exception of 50 minutes each day on average for brief exercise and shower periods, during which he nonetheless remained isolated from other inmates and was constrained by leg irons and waist chains).</p>

<p id="fc1b947f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet even when notice and a hearing are required, there are a multitude of ways of providing them.

What type of a hearing must be supplied—is a full trial-type, adversarial hearing required, or is a much more informal proceeding sufficient? What procedural safeguards must be accorded at the hearing? Must the government provide the right to be represented by an attorney at the hearing, and if so, is the government required to provide indigents with a free lawyer if they cannot afford one? When must the hearing occur—must it be before the deprivation can occur, or is a post-deprivation hearing sufficient? What is the standard of proof, and who has the burden of proof? Who is a permissible decision maker—must it be a judge or can others suffice? And these are just some of the choices that must be made in deciding what due process requires.</p>

<p id="fc1bbb99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cash benefits are provided to workers during periods in which they are completely disabled under the disability insurance benefits program created by the 1956 amendments to Title II of the Social Security Act. Respondent Eldridge was first awarded benefits in June 1968. In March 1972, he received a questionnaire from the state agency charged with monitoring his medical condition. Eldridge completed the questionnaire, indicating that his condition had not improved and identifying the medical sources, including physicians, from whom he had received treatment recently. The state agency then obtained reports from his physician and a psychiatric consultant. After considering these reports and other information in his file the agency informed Eldridge by letter that it had made a tentative determination that his disability had ceased in May 1972. The letter included a statement of reasons for the proposed termination of benefits, and advised Eldridge that he might request reasonable time in which to obtain and submit additional information pertaining to his condition.</p>
<p id="fc1bbb9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his written response, Eldridge disputed one characterization of his medical condition and indicated that the agency already had enough evidence to establish his disability. The state agency then made its final determination that he had ceased to be disabled in May 1972. This determination was accepted by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which notified Eldridge in July that his benefits would terminate after that month. The notification also advised him of his right to seek reconsideration by the state agency of this initial determination within six months.</p>
<p id="fc1bbb9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead of requesting reconsideration Eldridge commenced this action challenging the constitutional validity of the administrative procedures established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for assessing whether there exists a continuing disability. He sought an immediate reinstatement of benefits pending a hearing on the issue of his disability.</p>

<p id="fc1bbb9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of “liberty” or “property” interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment. The Secretary does not contend that procedural due process is inapplicable to terminations of Social Security disability benefits. He recognizes, as has been implicit in our prior decisions, that the interest of an individual in continued receipt of <span title="1164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1164">p. 1164</span>these benefits is a statutorily created “property” interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. Rather, the Secretary contends that the existing administrative procedures, detailed below, provide all the process that is constitutionally due before a recipient can be deprived of that interest.</p>
<p id="fc1bbb9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court consistently has held that some form of hearing is required before an individual is finally deprived of a property interest. The “right to be heard before being condemned to suffer grievous loss of any kind, even though it may not involve the stigma and hardships of a criminal conviction, is a principle basic to our society.” The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Eldridge agrees that the review procedures available to a claimant before the initial determination of ineligibility becomes final would be adequate if disability benefits were not terminated until after the evidentiary hearing stage of the administrative process. The dispute centers upon what process is due prior to the initial termination of benefits, pending review.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[R]esolution of the issue whether the administrative procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected. [O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since a recipient whose benefits are terminated is awarded full retroactive relief if he ultimately prevails, his sole interest is in the uninterrupted receipt of this source of income pending final administrative decision on his claim. His potential injury is thus similar in nature to that of the welfare recipient in <i>Goldberg.</i> Only in <i>Goldberg</i> has the Court held that due process requires an evidentiary hearing prior to a temporary deprivation. It was emphasized there that welfare assistance is given to persons on the very margin of subsistence. Eligibility for disability benefits, in contrast, is not based upon financial need. Indeed, it is wholly unrelated to the worker’s income or support from any other sources.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Goldberg</i> illustrates, the degree of potential deprivation that may be created by a particular decision is a factor to be considered in assessing the validity of any administrative decisionmaking process. The potential deprivation here is generally likely to be less than in <i>Goldberg</i>, although the degree of difference can be overstated. In view of the torpidity of this administrative review process, and the typically modest resources of the family unit of the physically disabled worker, the hardship imposed upon the erroneously terminated disability recipient may be significant. Still, the disabled worker’s need is likely to be less than that of a welfare recipient. In addition to the possibility of access to private resources, other forms of government assistance will become available where the termination of disability benefits places a worker or his family below the subsistence level. In view of these potential sources of temporary income, there is less reason here than in <i>Goldberg</i> to depart from the ordinary principle, established by our decisions, that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1165">p. 1165</span>An additional factor to be considered here is the fairness and reliability of the existing pretermination procedures, and the probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards. Central to the evaluation of any administrative process is the nature of the relevant inquiry.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to remain eligible for benefits the disabled worker must demonstrate by means of “medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques,” that he is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment. . . .” In short, a medical assessment of the worker’s physical or mental condition is required. This is a more sharply focused and easily documented decision than the typical determination of welfare entitlement. In the latter case, a wide variety of information may be deemed relevant, and issues of witness credibility and veracity often are critical to the decisionmaking process. <i>Goldberg</i> noted that in such circumstances “written submissions are a wholly unsatisfactory basis for decision.” By contrast, the decision whether to discontinue disability benefits will turn, in most cases, upon “routine, standard, and unbiased medical reports by physician specialists.” To be sure, credibility and veracity may be a factor in the ultimate disability assessment in some cases. But procedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions. The potential value of an evidentiary hearing, or even oral presentation to the decisionmaker, is substantially less in this context than in <i>Goldberg.</i></p>
<p id="fc1bbba5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A further safeguard against mistake is the policy of allowing the disability recipient’s representative full access to all information relied upon by the state agency. In addition, prior to the cutoff of benefits the agency informs the recipient of its tentative assessment, the reasons therefore, and provides a summary of the evidence that it considers most relevant. Opportunity is then afforded the recipient to submit additional evidence or arguments, enabling him to challenge directly the accuracy of information in his file as well as the correctness of the agency’s tentative conclusions. These procedures, again as contrasted with those before the Court in <i>Goldberg</i>, enable the recipient to “mold” his argument to respond to the precise issues which the decisionmaker regards as crucial.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In striking the appropriate due process balance the final factor to be assessed is the public interest. This includes the administrative burden and other societal costs that would be associated with requiring, as a matter of constitutional right, an evidentiary hearing upon demand in all cases prior to the termination of disability benefits. The most visible burden would be the incremental cost resulting from the increased number of hearings and the expense of providing benefits to ineligible recipients pending decision. No one can predict the extent of the increase, but the fact that full benefits would continue until after such hearings would assure the exhaustion in most cases of this attractive option.</p>
<p id="fc1bbba7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government’s interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost.</p>
<p id="fc1be2b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ultimate balance involves a determination as to when, under our constitutional system, judicial-type procedures must be imposed upon administrative <span title="1166" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1166">p. 1166</span>action to assure fairness. In assessing what process is due in this case, substantial weight must be given to the good-faith judgments of the individuals charged by Congress with the administration of social welfare programs that the procedures they have provided assure fair consideration of the entitlement claims of individuals. This is especially so where, as here, the prescribed procedures not only provide the claimant with an effective process for asserting his claim prior to any administrative action, but also assure a right to an evidentiary hearing, as well as to subsequent judicial review, before the denial of his claim becomes final. We conclude that an evidentiary hearing is not required prior to the termination of disability benefits and that the present administrative procedures fully comport with due process.</p>
<p id="fc1be2b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> concurs, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc1be2ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that, prior to termination of benefits, Eldridge must be afforded an evidentiary hearing of the type required for welfare beneficiaries. See Goldberg v. Kelly (1970). I would add that the Court’s consideration that a discontinuance of disability benefits may cause the recipient to suffer only a limited deprivation is no argument. It is speculative. Moreover, the very legislative determination to provide disability benefits, without any prerequisite determination of need in fact, presumes a need by the recipient which is not this Court’s function to denigrate. Indeed, in the present case, it is indicated that because disability benefits were terminated there was a foreclosure upon the Eldridge home and the family’s furniture was repossessed, forcing Eldridge, his wife, and their children to sleep in one bed. Finally, it is also no argument that a worker, who has been placed in the untenable position of having been denied disability benefits, may still seek other forms of public assistance.</p>
<p id="fc1be2bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Mathews</i> test has been praised because it focuses a court’s attention on what seem to be the right questions in deciding the nature of the procedural protections. <i>Mathews</i> requires courts to balance the importance of the interest involved, the degree to which the procedure will make a difference, and the cost to the government. An expensive trial-type hearing would be out of place for a minor interest in a situation where there is little likelihood of a factual dispute.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12D4E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12D4E_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">68</a></span> But an adversarial hearing is essential, despite its expense, if there is a fundamental right at stake, such as the right of parents to the custody of their children.</p>
<p id="fc1be2bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet <i>Mathews</i> also can be criticized for failing to provide any real guidance as to how courts should balance the competing interests. The reality is that courts have enormous discretion in evaluating each of the three factors and especially how to balance them. Such multipart balancing inherently provides little constraint on judicial decisions. Indeed, Justice Rehnquist once remarked that under <i>Mathews</i>, “[t]he balance is simply an ad hoc weighing which depends to a great extent upon how the Court subjectively views the underlying interests at stake.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12D66_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12D66_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">69</a></span></p>
<p id="fc1be2bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the <i>Mathews</i> test has been criticized for giving insufficient weight to the intrinsic benefits of procedural protections and for giving disproportionate <span title="1167" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1167">p. 1167</span>weight to quantifiable variables such as cost.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12D74_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12D74_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">70</a></span> Due process, it is argued, is important not only to enhance the accuracy of decision makers but to treat individuals fairly and with dignity when important decisions are made about their lives. <i>Mathews</i> can be criticized for failing to recognize these values.</p>
<p id="fc1be2c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, it is firmly established that in deciding what procedures are required, the Court employs the <i>Mathews</i> three-part balancing test. Two examples are presented below: government employment and parents’ rights.</p>

<p id="fc1c09d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), the Supreme Court, without a majority opinion, ruled that the government could fire a public employee for misconduct without a full hearing prior to termination. The Court said that it was sufficient that there was the opportunity for a pretermination review within the department followed by a post-termination hearing.</p>
<p id="fc1c09d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court reaffirmed this in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), where it expressly applied the <i>Mathews</i> balancing test. In <i>Loudermill</i>, the Court concluded that due process was satisfied if the government provided a fired employee both an informal pretermination proceeding where it was possible to respond to charges and then a later post-termination hearing.</p>
<p id="fc1c09d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the first aspect of the <i>Mathews</i> balancing test, the Court found that continued employment by the government is a “significant” interest for the individual. As to the second part of the balancing test, the Court concluded that an informal pretermination proceeding was essential to avoid erroneous terminations. As to the third prong of the test, the Court recognized that any pretermination proceeding would entail costs to the government. But the Court said that the importance of the interest to the individual and the need to avoid errors justified requiring an informal pretermination proceeding despite these costs. The Court emphasized that “the pre-termination hearing, though necessary, need not be elaborate.”</p>
<p id="fc1c09d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Arnett</i>, and especially <i>Loudermill</i>, provide the type of compromise that <i>Mathews</i> envisioned. The Court recognizes the importance of providing a pretermination hearing to employees but also acknowledges the costs to the government of doing this. So the Court strikes a compromise: an informal pretermination proceeding to be followed, if necessary, by a formal post-termination hearing.</p>

<p id="fc1c09da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has been inconsistent in the degree of due process it has required in cases concerning parental rights. On the one hand, there have been cases where the Court has stressed the importance of the interest and has required substantial procedural protections. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a state must prove, by “clear and convincing evidence,” the need to terminate parental rights at a hearing before such rights are terminated.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12DD0_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12DD0_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">71</a></span></p>

In Little v. Streater, 452 U.S. 1 (1981), the Court held that the government must pay for blood tests for indigent defendants in paternity cases. The Court explained that a defendant unable to afford the cost of the blood tests would lack a “meaningful opportunity to be heard” because there was no other way to refute the allegation of paternity. The Court explained that “a cost requirement, valid on its face, may offend due process because it operates to foreclose a particular party’s opportunity to be heard.”</p>
<p id="fc1c09dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But on the other hand, the Court has held that the government need not automatically provide an attorney to indigent parents at parental termination proceedings. In Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 (1981), the Court explicitly applied the <i>Mathews</i> test and concluded that the obligation to provide counsel depends on the circumstances of the particular case and is not required in all instances where the government seeks to end parental rights. The Court said that it had recognized an automatic right to government-appointed counsel for indigents “only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.”</p>
<p id="fc1c09de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court recognized that a “parent’s desire for and right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children is an undeniably important interest that undeniably warrants deference.” The Court said that “the State has an urgent interest in the welfare of the child” that also is served by ensuring accurate and just results at parental termination hearings.</p>
<p id="fc1c09df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, the Court did not find that due process always requires the provision of counsel for indigent parents at such proceedings. The Court said that sometimes the presence of an attorney would matter little in the outcome of the proceedings. The Court declared that “the presence of counsel for Ms. Lassiter could not have made a determinative difference.” The Court said that “Ms. Lassiter had expressly declined to appear at the 1975 child custody hearing, . . . had not even bothered to speak to her retained lawyer after being notified of the termination hearing, . . . [and failed] to make an effort to contest the termination proceeding.”</p>
<p id="fc1c09e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that “wise public policy” may cause states to provide an attorney for all indigent parents at termination proceedings and those concerning neglect or dependency. The Court also recognized that in some instances the government would be required to appoint counsel where “the parent’s interests were at their strongest, the State’s interests were at their weakest, and the risks of errors were at their peak.” But the Court concluded that the Constitution does not “require the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding.”</p>
<p id="fc1c30f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The likelihood of error without the appointment of counsel was the decisive factor for the majority in <i>Lassiter</i>. The dissent, written by Justice Blackmun and joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall, argued that attorneys always should be provided to prevent errors. Often parents will not know enough about their rights and the procedures to make a showing as to how an attorney would make a difference. In some cases, it would take an attorney to make the argument as to why an attorney is necessary, but no lawyer is provided until after such a showing. Justice Blackmun thus lamented that “[b]y intimidation, inarticulateness, or confusion, a parent can lose forever all contact and involvement with his or her offspring.”</p>
<p id="fc1c30f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens questioned the application of the <i>Mathews</i> balancing test to a fundamental liberty interest outside <span title="1169" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1169">p. 1169</span>the property context. He argued that the utilitarian calculus employed under <i>Mathews</i> is ill suited for cases involving basic freedoms. He said that even if the costs to the state were great, procedural protections such as the right to counsel in termination proceedings are essential because “protecting our liberty from deprivation by the State without due process of law is priceless.”</p>

<p id="fc1c30f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases generally present substantive or procedural due process issues, but certainly the same case could involve both. For example, as explained above, the Court has said that under the liberty of the due process clause, parents have a right to custody of their children. Substantive due process requires that the government show a compelling reason for terminating custody; procedural due process requires notice and a hearing before termination of custody. Both could arise in the same case. The case below presents an example of substantive and procedural due process arising in the same case as a convicted criminal defendant argued that both provided him the right to have DNA testing done (at his own expense), which could have exonerated him of the crime for which he was convicted. The Supreme Court rejected both claims and ruled in favor of the government.</p>

<p id="fc1c580c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. It has the potential to significantly improve both the criminal justice system and police investigative practices. The Federal Government and the States have recognized this, and have developed special approaches to ensure that this evidentiary tool can be effectively incorporated into established criminal procedure—usually but not always through legislation.</p>
<p id="fc1c580d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this prompt and considered response, the respondent, William Osborne, proposes a different approach: the recognition of a freestanding and far-reaching constitutional right of access to this new type of evidence. This approach would take the development of rules and procedures in this area out of the hands of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a focused manner and turn it over to federal courts applying the broad parameters of the Due Process Clause. There is no reason to constitutionalize the issue in this way. Because the decision below would do just that, we reverse.</p>

<p id="fc1c580f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This lawsuit arose out of a violent crime committed 16 years ago, which has resulted in a long string of litigation in the state and federal courts. On the evening of March 22, 1993, two men driving through Anchorage, Alaska, solicited <span title="1170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1170">p. 1170</span>sex from a female prostitute, K.G. She agreed to perform fellatio on both men for $100 and got in their car. The three spent some time looking for a place to stop and ended up in a deserted area near Earthquake Park. When K.G. demanded payment in advance, the two men pulled out a gun and forced her to perform fellatio on the driver while the passenger penetrated her vaginally, using a blue condom she had brought. The passenger then ordered K.G. out of the car and told her to lie face-down in the snow. Fearing for her life, she refused, and the two men choked her and beat her with the gun. When K.G. tried to flee, the passenger beat her with a wooden axe handle and shot her in the head while she lay on the ground. They kicked some snow on top of her and left her for dead.</p>
<p id="fc1c5810-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">K.G. did not die; the bullet had only grazed her head. Once the two men left, she found her way back to the road, and flagged down a passing car to take her home. Ultimately, she received medical care and spoke to the police. At the scene of the crime, the police recovered a spent shell casing, the axe handle, some of K.G.’s clothing stained with blood, and the blue condom.</p>
<p id="fc1c5811-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Six days later, two military police officers at Fort Richardson pulled over Dexter Jackson for flashing his headlights at another vehicle. In his car they discovered a gun (which matched the shell casing), as well as several items K.G. had been carrying the night of the attack. The car also matched the description K.G. had given to the police. Jackson admitted that he had been the driver during the rape and assault, and told the police that William Osborne had been his passenger. Other evidence also implicated Osborne. K.G. picked out his photograph (with some uncertainty) and at trial she identified Osborne as her attacker. Other witnesses testified that shortly before the crime, Osborne had called Jackson from an arcade, and then driven off with him. An axe handle similar to the one at the scene of the crime was found in Osborne’s room on the military base where he lived.</p>
<p id="fc1c5812-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State also performed DQ Alpha testing on sperm found in the blue condom. DQ Alpha testing is a relatively inexact form of DNA testing that can clear some wrongly accused individuals, but generally cannot narrow the perpetrator down to less than 5% of the population. The semen found on the condom had a genotype that matched a blood sample taken from Osborne, but not ones from Jackson, K.G., or a third suspect named James Hunter. Osborne is black, and approximately 16% of black individuals have such a genotype. App. 117-119. In other words, the testing ruled out Jackson and Hunter as possible sources of the semen, and also ruled out over 80% of other black individuals. The State also examined some pubic hairs found at the scene of the crime, which were not susceptible to DQ Alpha testing, but which state witnesses attested to be similar to Osborne’s.</p>
<p id="fc1c5813-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Osborne and Jackson were convicted by an Alaska jury of kidnapping, assault, and sexual assault. They were acquitted of an additional count of sexual assault and of attempted murder. Finding it “nearly miraculous” that K.G. had survived, the trial judge sentenced Osborne to 26 years in prison, with 5 suspended. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Osborne then sought postconviction relief in Alaska state court. He claimed that he had asked his attorney, Sidney Billingslea, to seek more discriminating restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) DNA testing during trial, and argued that she was constitutionally ineffective for not doing so. In two decisions, the Alaska Court of Appeals concluded that Osborne had no right to the RFLP test. The court <span title="1171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1171">p. 1171</span>relied heavily on the fact that Osborne had confessed to some of his crimes in a 2004 application for parole—in which it is a crime to lie. In this statement, Osborne acknowledged forcing K.G. to have sex at gunpoint, as well as beating her and covering her with snow. He repeated this confession before the parole board.</p>

<p id="fc1c5815-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before. Since its first use in criminal investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been several major advances in DNA technology, culminating in STR technology. It is now often possible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed without any forensic and scientific testing at all, there is no technology comparable to DNA testing for matching tissues when such evidence is at issue. DNA testing has exonerated wrongly convicted people, and has confirmed the convictions of many others.</p>
<p id="fc1c5816-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, DNA testing alone does not always resolve a case. Where there is enough other incriminating evidence and an explanation for the DNA result, science alone cannot prove a prisoner innocent. The availability of technologies not available at trial cannot mean that every criminal conviction, or even every criminal conviction involving biological evidence, is suddenly in doubt. The dilemma is how to harness DNA’s power to prove innocence without unnecessarily overthrowing the established system of criminal justice.</p>
<p id="fc1c5817-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That task belongs primarily to the legislature. “[T]he States are currently engaged in serious, thoughtful examinations,” of how to ensure the fair and effective use of this testing within the existing criminal justice framework. Forty-six States have already enacted statutes dealing specifically with access to DNA evidence. The State of Alaska itself is considering joining them. The Federal Government has also passed the Innocence Protection Act of 2004, which allows federal prisoners to move for court-ordered DNA testing under certain specified conditions.</p>
<p id="fc1c5818-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These laws recognize the value of DNA evidence but also the need for certain conditions on access to the State’s evidence. A requirement of demonstrating materiality is common, but it is not the only one. The federal statute, for example, requires a sworn statement that the applicant is innocent. This requirement is replicated in several state statutes. States also impose a range of diligence requirements. Several require the requested testing to “have been technologically impossible at trial.” Others deny testing to those who declined testing at trial for tactical reasons.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alaska is one of a handful of States yet to enact legislation specifically addressing the issue of evidence requested for DNA testing. But that does not mean that such evidence is unavailable for those seeking to prove their innocence. Instead, Alaska courts are addressing how to apply existing laws for discovery and postconviction relief to this novel technology. [T]he Alaska Court of Appeals has invoked a widely accepted three-part test to govern additional rights to DNA access under the State Constitution. Drawing on the experience with DNA evidence of State Supreme Courts around the country, the Court of Appeals explained that it was “reluctant to hold that Alaska law offers no remedy <span title="1172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1172">p. 1172</span>to defendants who could prove their factual innocence.” It was “prepared to hold, however, that a defendant who seeks post-conviction DNA testing . . . must show (1) that the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification evidence, (2) that there was a demonstrable doubt concerning the defendant’s identification as the perpetrator, and (3) that scientific testing would likely be conclusive on this issue.” Thus, the Alaska courts have suggested that even those who do not get discovery under the State’s criminal rules have available to them a safety valve under the State Constitution.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc1c7e2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">[III]</p></div>
<p id="fc1c7e2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” This Clause imposes procedural limitations on a State’s power to take away protected entitlements. Osborne argues that access to the State’s evidence is a “process” needed to vindicate his right to prove himself innocent and get out of jail. Process is not an end in itself, so a necessary premise of this argument is that he has an entitlement (what our precedents call a “liberty interest”) to prove his innocence even after a fair trial has proved otherwise. We must first examine this asserted liberty interest to determine what process (if any) is due.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In identifying his potential liberty interest, Osborne first attempts to rely on the Governor’s constitutional authority to “grant pardons, commutations, and reprieves.” That claim can be readily disposed of. We have held that noncapital defendants do not have a liberty interest in traditional state executive clemency, to which no particular claimant is <i>entitled</i> as a matter of state law. Osborne therefore cannot challenge the constitutionality of any procedures available to vindicate an interest in state clemency.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Osborne does, however, have a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state law. As explained, Alaska law provides that those who use “newly discovered evidence” to “establis[h] by clear and convincing evidence that [they are] innocent” may obtain “vacation of [their] conviction or sentence in the interest of justice.” This “state-created right can, in some circumstances, beget yet other rights to procedures essential to the realization of the parent right.”</p>
<p id="fc1c7e2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man. At trial, the defendant is presumed innocent and may demand that the government prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. But “[o]nce a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and convicted of the offense for which he was charged, the presumption of innocence disappears.” “Given a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty.”</p>
<p id="fc1c7e2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State accordingly has more flexibility in deciding what procedures are needed in the context of postconviction relief. “[W]hen a State chooses to offer help to those seeking relief from convictions,” due process does not “dictat[e] the exact form such assistance must assume.” Osborne’s right to due process is not parallel to a trial right, but rather must be analyzed in light of the fact that he has already been found guilty at a fair trial, and has only a limited interest in postconviction relief.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, the question is whether consideration of Osborne’s claim within the framework of the State’s procedures for postconviction relief “offends some <span title="1173" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1173">p. 1173</span>principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,” or “transgresses any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in operation.”</p>
<p id="fc1c7e31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see nothing inadequate about the procedures Alaska has provided to vindicate its state right to postconviction relief in general, and nothing inadequate about how those procedures apply to those who seek access to DNA evidence. Alaska provides a substantive right to be released on a sufficiently compelling showing of new evidence that establishes innocence. It exempts such claims from otherwise applicable time limits. The State provides for discovery in postconviction proceedings, and has—through judicial decision—specified that this discovery procedure is available to those seeking access to DNA evidence. These procedures are not without limits. The evidence must indeed be newly available to qualify under Alaska’s statute, must have been diligently pursued, and must also be sufficiently material. These procedures are similar to those provided for DNA evidence by federal law and the law of other States and they are not inconsistent with the “traditions and conscience of our people” or with “any recognized principle of fundamental fairness.” And there is more. While the Alaska courts have not had occasion to conclusively decide the question, the Alaska Court of Appeals has suggested that the State Constitution provides an additional right of access to DNA. In expressing its “reluctan[ce] to hold that Alaska law offers no remedy” to those who belatedly seek DNA testing, and in invoking the three-part test used by other state courts, the court indicated that in an appropriate case the State Constitution may provide a failsafe even for those who cannot satisfy the statutory requirements under general postconviction procedures.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals below relied only on procedural due process, but Osborne seeks to defend the judgment on the basis of substantive due process as well. He asks that we recognize a freestanding right to DNA evidence untethered from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate with it. We reject the invitation and conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that there is no such substantive due process right. “As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Osborne seeks access to state evidence so that he can apply new DNA-testing technology that might prove him innocent. There is no long history of such a right, and “[t]he mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that ‘substantive due process’ sustains it.”</p>
<p id="fc1c7e33-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And there are further reasons to doubt. The elected governments of the States are actively confronting the challenges DNA technology poses to our criminal justice systems and our traditional notions of finality, as well as the opportunities it affords. To suddenly constitutionalize this area would short-circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered legislative response. The first DNA testing statutes were passed in 1994 and 1997. In the past decade, 44 States and the Federal Government have followed suit, reflecting the increased availability of DNA testing. As noted, Alaska itself is considering such legislation. “By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.” “[J]udicial imposition of a categorical remedy . . . might pretermit other responsible solutions being considered in Congress and state <span title="1174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1174">p. 1174</span>legislatures.” If we extended substantive due process to this area, we would cast these statutes into constitutional doubt and be forced to take over the issue of DNA access ourselves. We are reluctant to enlist the Federal Judiciary in creating a new constitutional code of rules for handling DNA.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Establishing a freestanding right to access DNA evidence for testing would force us to act as policymakers, and our substantive-due-process rulemaking authority would not only have to cover the right of access but a myriad of other issues. We would soon have to decide if there is a constitutional obligation to preserve forensic evidence that might later be tested. If so, for how long? Would it be different for different types of evidence? Would the State also have some obligation to gather such evidence in the first place? How much, and when? No doubt there would be a miscellany of other minor directives.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e35-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DNA evidence will undoubtedly lead to changes in the criminal justice system. It has done so already. The question is whether further change will primarily be made by legislative revision and judicial interpretation of the existing system, or whether the Federal Judiciary must leap ahead—revising (or even discarding) the system by creating a new constitutional right and taking over responsibility for refining it.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e36-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal courts should not presume that state criminal procedures will be inadequate to deal with technological change. The criminal justice system has historically accommodated new types of evidence, and is a time-tested means of carrying out society’s interest in convicting the guilty while respecting individual rights. That system, like any human endeavor, cannot be perfect. DNA evidence shows that it has not been. But there is no basis for Osborne’s approach of assuming that because DNA has shown that these procedures are not flawless, DNA evidence must be treated as categorically outside the process, rather than within it.</p>
<p id="fc1c7e37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> join, and with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span> joins as to Part I, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc1ca548-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Alaska possesses physical evidence that, if tested, will conclusively establish whether respondent William Osborne committed rape and attempted murder. If he did, justice has been served by his conviction and sentence. If not, Osborne has needlessly spent decades behind bars while the true culprit has not been brought to justice. The DNA test Osborne seeks is a simple one, its cost modest, and its results uniquely precise. Yet for reasons the State has been unable or unwilling to articulate, it refuses to allow Osborne to test the evidence at his own expense and to thereby ascertain the truth once and for all.</p>
<p id="fc1ca549-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I am convinced that Osborne has a constitutional right of access to the evidence he wishes to test and that, on the facts of this case, he has made a sufficient showing of entitlement to that evidence, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="fc1ca54a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Osborne asserts a right to access the State’s evidence that derives from the Due Process Clause itself. Whether framed as a “substantive liberty interest . . . protected through a procedural due process right” to have evidence made available for testing, or as a substantive due process right to be free of arbitrary government action, the result is the same: On the record now before us, Osborne has established his entitlement to test the State’s evidence.</p>
<p id="fc1ca54b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The liberty protected by the Due Process Clause is not a creation of the Bill of Rights. Indeed, our Nation has long recognized that the liberty safeguarded by the Constitution has far deeper roots.</p>
<p id="fc1ca54c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1175">p. 1175</span>Although a valid criminal conviction justifies punitive detention, it does not entirely eliminate the liberty interests of convicted persons. For while a prisoner’s “rights may be diminished by the needs and exigencies of the institutional environment[,] . . . [t]here is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country.” It is therefore far too late in the day to question the basic proposition that convicted persons such as Osborne retain a constitutionally protected measure of interest in liberty, including the fundamental liberty of freedom from physical restraint.</p>
<p id="fc1ca54d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognition of this right draws strength from the fact that 46 States and the Federal Government have passed statutes providing access to evidence for DNA testing, and 3 additional states (including Alaska) provide similar access through court-made rules alone. These legislative developments are consistent with recent trends in legal ethics recognizing that prosecutors are obliged to disclose all forms of exculpatory evidence that come into their possession following conviction. The fact that nearly all the States have now recognized some postconviction right to DNA evidence makes it more, not less, appropriate to recognize a limited federal right to such evidence in cases where litigants are unfairly barred from obtaining relief in state court.</p>
<p id="fc1ca54e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent scientific advances in DNA analysis have made “it literally possible to confirm guilt or innocence beyond any question whatsoever, at least in some categories of cases.” As the Court recognizes today, the powerful new evidence that modern DNA testing can provide is “unlike anything known before.”</p>
<p id="fc1ca54f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the right Osborne seeks to vindicate is framed as purely substantive, the proper result is no less clear. “The touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government.” When government action is so lacking in justification that it “can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense,” it violates the Due Process Clause. In my view, the State’s refusal to provide Osborne with access to evidence for DNA testing qualifies as arbitrary.</p>
<p id="fc1ca550-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Throughout the course of state and federal litigation, the State has failed to provide any concrete reason for denying Osborne the DNA testing he seeks, and none is apparent. Because Osborne has offered to pay for the tests, cost is not a factor. And as the State now concedes, there is no reason to doubt that such testing would provide conclusive confirmation of Osborne’s guilt or revelation of his innocence. In the courts below, the State refused to provide an explanation for its refusal to permit testing of the evidence, and in this Court, its explanation has been, at best, unclear. Insofar as the State has articulated any reason at all, it appears to be a generalized interest in protecting the finality of the judgment of conviction from any possible future attacks.</p>
<p id="fc1ca551-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we have long recognized that States have an interest in securing the finality of their judgments, finality is not a stand-alone value that trumps a State’s overriding interest in ensuring that justice is done in its courts and secured to its citizens. Indeed, when absolute proof of innocence is readily at hand, a State should not shrink from the possibility that error may have occurred. Rather, our system of justice is strengthened by “recogniz[ing] the need for, and imperative of, a safety valve in those rare instances where objective proof that the convicted actually did not commit the offense later becomes available through the progress of science.”</p>
<p id="fc1ca552-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion draws strength from the powerful state interests that offset the State’s purported interest in finality <i>per se</i>. When a person is convicted for <span title="1176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1176">p. 1176</span>a crime he did not commit, the true culprit escapes punishment. DNA testing may lead to his identification. Crime victims, the law enforcement profession, and society at large share a strong interest in identifying and apprehending the actual perpetrators of vicious crimes, such as the rape and attempted murder that gave rise to this case.</p>
<p id="fc1ca553-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The arbitrariness of the State’s conduct is highlighted by comparison to the private interests it denies. It seems to me obvious that if a wrongly convicted person were to produce proof of his actual innocence, no state interest would be sufficient to justify his continued punitive detention. If such proof can be readily obtained without imposing a significant burden on the State, a refusal to provide access to such evidence is wholly unjustified.</p>
<p id="fc1ca554-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, an individual’s interest in his physical liberty is one of constitutional significance. That interest would be vindicated by providing postconviction access to DNA evidence, as would the State’s interest in ensuring that it punishes the true perpetrator of a crime. In this case, the State has suggested no countervailing interest that justifies its refusal to allow Osborne to test the evidence in its possession and has not provided any other nonarbitrary explanation for its conduct. Consequently, I am left to conclude that the State’s failure to provide Osborne access to the evidence constitutes arbitrary action that offends basic principles of due process.</p>

Though the dissent has no basis for the level of generality it would select, we do: We refer to the most specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting, or denying protection to, the asserted right can be identified. If, for example, there were no societal tradition, either way, regarding the rights of the natural father of a child adulterously conceived, we would have to consult, and (if possible) reason from, the traditions regarding natural fathers in general. But there is such a more specific tradition, and it unqualifiedly denies protection to such a parent.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fc0c2aa1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">Because such general traditions provide such imprecise guidance, they permit judges to dictate rather than discern the society’s views. The need, if arbitrary decisionmaking is to be avoided, to adopt the most specific tradition as the point of reference—or at least to announce, as Justice Brennan declines to do, some other criterion for selecting among the innumerable relevant traditions that could be consulted. Although assuredly having the virtue (if it be that) of leaving judges free to decide as they think best when the unanticipated occurs, a rule of law that binds neither by text nor by any particular, identifiable tradition is no rule of law at all.

But “neither the weight of the scientific evidence to date nor the observable reality of 33 years of legal abortion in the United States comports with the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman’s long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child that she did not intend to have. . . .” [Footnote by Justice Ginsburg.]</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fc126cb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN1150A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N1150A_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span>&nbsp;We are not faced in this case with the question whether a State might be required to defer to the decision of a surrogate if competent and probative evidence established that the patient herself had expressed a desire that the decision to terminate life-sustaining treatment be made for her by that individual.

Gore, were proceeding simultaneously. For example, voters in Palm Beach County brought a lawsuit seeking a new election there based on the so-called butterfly ballot, which they claimed violated Florida law and caused several thousand votes intended for Gore to be mistakenly cast for Pat Buchanan. The Florida trial court concluded that it lacked the constitutional authority to order a new election and the Florida Supreme Court denied review. Also, lawsuits were filed in two counties claiming that election officials had illegally filled in missing information on requests for absentee ballots. Both Florida trial court judges held this was not a basis for refusing to count the absentee ballots because the actions of election officials did not in any way taint the ballots themselves.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fc1727c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN12158_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N12158_ef812bb0-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">44</a></span>&nbsp;The percentage of nonvotes in this election in counties using a punch-card system was 3.92%; in contrast, the rate of error under the more modern optical-scan systems was only 1.43%. Put in other terms, for every 10,000 votes cast, punch-card systems result in 250 more nonvotes than optical-scan systems. A total of 3,718,305 votes were cast under punch-card systems, and 2,353,811 votes were cast under optical-scan systems.

For example, the Court concluded, “For these reasons—the absence of any evidence that the financing system discriminates against any definable category of ‘poor’ people or that it results in the absolute deprivation of education—the disadvantaged class is not susceptible of identification in traditional terms.” This aspect of the case and of the use of equal protection to safeguard the poor from discrimination is discussed in Chapter 7.

It has been aptly noted that “[s]ociety today is built around entitlement. The automobile dealer has his franchise, the doctor and lawyer their professional licenses, the worker his union membership, contract, and pension rights, the executive his contract and stock options; all are devices to aid security and independence. Many of the most important of these entitlements now flow from government: subsidies to farmers and businessmen, routes for airlines and channels for television stations; long-term contracts for defense, space, and education; Social Security pensions for individuals. Such sources of security, whether private or public, are no longer regarded as luxuries or gratuities; to the recipients they are essentials, fully deserved, and in no sense a form of charity. It is only the poor whose entitlements, although recognized by public policy, have not been effectively enforced.” Reich, Individual Rights and Social Welfare: The Emerging Legal Issues, 74 Yale L.J. 1245, 1255 (1965).
