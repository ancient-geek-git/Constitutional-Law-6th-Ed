<p id="fb89db2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When may Congress act? What laws may Congress adopt? A basic principle of American government is that Congress may act only if there is express or implied authority in the Constitution, whereas states may act unless the Constitution prohibits the action. Article I of the Constitution, which creates the federal legislative power, begins by stating, “All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” Additionally, the Tenth Amendment declares, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p id="fb89db2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In evaluating the constitutionality of any act of Congress, there are always two questions. First, does Congress have the authority under the Constitution to legislate? This requires defining the scope of the powers granted to Congress, particularly in Article I, §8 of the Constitution. Second, if so, does the law violate another constitutional provision or doctrine, such as by infringing separation of powers or interfering with individual liberties?</p>
<p id="fb89db2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering both of these questions the issue has arisen throughout American history as to the extent to which concern for state governments and their prerogatives should matter. During some eras of constitutional history, such as between the late nineteenth century and 1937 and again in the past decade, concern for state governments has profoundly answered how the Court has dealt with both of these questions. The Court during these times limited congressional power to leave areas of governance to state governments. During these times, the Court also directly protected state sovereignty, concluding that even valid exercises of legislative power are unconstitutional when they infringe state sovereignty. The Court has used the Tenth Amendment as the basis for this protection of state governments from federal encroachment.</p>
<p id="fb89db2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During other times of American history, however, the Court has refused to use concern over state governments either as a basis for narrowly interpreting the scope of Congress’s powers or as a limit through the Tenth Amendment on the reach of federal legislation. From the 1930s until the 1990s, the Court broadly defined the scope of Congress’s authority under Article I of the Constitution <span title="120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-120">p. 120</span>and refused to use the Tenth Amendment as a limit on federal power. Since the 1990s, the Court again has invalidated laws as exceeding the scope of Congress’s powers and as violating the Tenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb89db2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, throughout American history, Congress’s powers have been defined relative to the states. Some of the most important political battles in American history—abolition of slavery, Reconstruction, progressive labor legislation, the New Deal, the civil rights movement—have been fought over how power should be allocated between the federal and state governments.</p>
<p id="fb8a0240-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The division of power between Congress and the states is the focus of this chapter. The chapter considers how Congress’s powers enumerated in the Constitution should be defined. It also considers whether and when the Tenth Amendment, and its protection of state governments, is and should be a limit on congressional power.</p>
<p id="fb8a0241-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chapter begins with McCulloch v. Maryland, an enormously important case concerning the relationship between federal and state governments. Following <i>McCulloch</i>, the issue is raised as to the values to be gained and lost by safeguarding state government entities. As part of this discussion, the Court’s most recent major federalism decision—National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), concerning the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—is presented. It concerns issues examined in the following sections concerning the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Commerce Clause, the Spending Power, and the Tenth Amendment. Rather than divide the case and the dissents among the sections on this topic, it is presented as a whole, and each aspect can be considered in the context of the particular areas of federalism law. Subsequent sections of this chapter examine then particular federal powers, including the Necessary and Proper Clause (section B), especially Congress’s Commerce Clause authority (section C), its taxing and spending power (section D), its authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment (section E), and its power to authorize suits against state governments (section F).</p>

MARYLAND</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fb8a0244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCulloch v. Maryland is the most important Supreme Court decision in American history defining the scope of Congress’s powers and delineating the relationship between the federal government and the states. The issue in <i>McCulloch</i> is whether it is constitutional for the State of Maryland to tax the Bank of the United States.</p>
<p id="fb8a0245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some historical background is likely to be useful in understanding the decision. The controversy over the Bank of the United States began early in George Washington’s presidency, in 1790, with a major dispute in both Congress and the executive branch as to whether Congress had the authority to create such a bank. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton strongly favored creating a Bank of the United States, but he was opposed by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Both Jefferson and Randolph argued that Congress lacked the authority under the Constitution to create such a bank and that doing so would usurp state government prerogatives. Ultimately, Hamilton persuaded President George Washington to support creating the bank, but the debate continued in Congress. James Madison, then <span title="121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-121">p. 121</span>in the House of Representatives, echoed the views of Jefferson and Randolph, and opposed the bank. Despite this opposition, Congress created the first Bank of the United States.</p>
<p id="fb8a0246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bank existed for 21 years until its charter expired in 1811. However, after the War of 1812, the country experienced serious economic problems, and the Bank of the United States was re-created in 1816. In fact, although he had opposed such a bank a quarter of a century earlier, President James Madison endorsed its re-creation. The U.S. government actually owned only 20 percent of the new bank.</p>
<p id="fb8a0247-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bank of the United States did not solve the country’s economic problems and, indeed, many blamed the bank’s monetary policies for aggravating a serious depression. State governments were particularly angry at the bank because the bank called in loans owed by the states. Several states adopted laws designed to limit the operation of the bank. Some states adopted laws prohibiting its operation within their borders. Others, such as Maryland, taxed it. The Maryland law required that any bank not chartered by the state pay either an annual tax of $15,000 or a tax of 2 percent on all of its notes that needed to be on special stamped paper.</p>
<p id="fb8a0248-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bank refused to pay the Maryland tax, and John James sued for himself and the State of Maryland in the County Court of Baltimore to recover the money owed under the tax. The defendant, McCulloch, was the cashier of that branch of the Bank of the United States. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, James, and the State of Maryland, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>

<p id="fb8a024f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case now to be determined, the defendant, a sovereign state, denies the obligation of a law enacted by the legislature of the Union, and the plaintiff, on his part, contests the validity of an act which has been passed by the legislature of that state. The constitution of our country, in its most interesting and vital parts, is to be considered; the conflicting powers of the government of the Union and of its members, as marked in that constitution, are to be discussed; and an opinion given, which may essentially influence the great operations of the government. No tribunal can approach such a question without a deep sense of its importance, and of the awful responsibility involved in its decision. But it must be decided peacefully, or remain a source of hostile legislation, perhaps, of hostility of a still more serious nature; and if it is to be so decided, by this tribunal alone can the decision be made. On the supreme court of the United States has the constitution of our country devolved this important duty.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb8a0250-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">[I]</p></div>
<p id="fb8a2961-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question made in the cause is—has congress power to incorporate a bank? It has been truly said, that this can scarcely be considered as an open <span title="122" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-122">p. 122</span>question, entirely unprejudiced by the former proceedings of the nation respecting it. The principle now contested was introduced at a very early period of our history, has been recognised by many successive legislatures, and has been acted upon by the judicial department, in cases of peculiar delicacy, as a law of undoubted obligation.</p>
<p id="fb8a2962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will not be denied, that a bold and daring usurpation might be resisted, after an acquiescence still longer and more complete than this. But it is conceived, that a doubtful question, one on which human reason may pause, and the human judgment be suspended, in the decision of which the great principles of liberty are not concerned, but the respective powers of those who are equally the representatives of the people, are to be adjusted; if not put at rest by the practice of the government, ought to receive a considerable impression from that practice. An exposition of the constitution, deliberately established by legislative acts, on the faith of which an immense property has been advanced, ought not to be lightly disregarded.</p>
<p id="fb8a2963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power now contested was exercised by the first congress elected under the present constitution. The bill for incorporating the Bank of the United States did not steal upon an unsuspecting legislature, and pass unobserved. Its principle was completely understood, and was opposed with equal zeal and ability. After being resisted, first, in the fair and open field of debate, and afterwards, in the executive cabinet, with as much persevering talent as any measure has ever experienced, and being supported by arguments which convinced minds as pure and as intelligent as this country can boast, it became a law. The original act was permitted to expire; but a short experience of the embarrassments to which the refusal to revive it exposed the government, convinced those who were most prejudiced against the measure of its necessity, and induced the passage of the present law. It would require no ordinary share of intrepidity, to assert that a measure adopted under these circumstances, was a bold and plain usurpation, to which the constitution gave no countenance.</p>
<p id="fb8a2964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing this question, the counsel for the state of Maryland have deemed it of some importance, in the construction of the constitution, to consider that instrument, not as emanating from the people, but as the act of sovereign and independent states. The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion. It would be difficult to sustain this proposition. The convention which framed the constitution was indeed elected by the state legislatures. But the instrument, when it came from their hands, was a mere proposal, without obligation, or pretensions to it. It was reported to the then existing congress of the United States, with a request that it might “be submitted to a convention of delegates, chosen in each state by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification.”</p>
<p id="fb8a2965-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This mode of proceeding was adopted; and by the convention, by congress, and by the state legislatures, the instrument was submitted to the people. They acted upon it in the only manner in which they can act safely, effectively and wisely, on such a subject, by assembling in convention. It is true, they assembled in their several states—and where else should they have assembled? No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate the states, and of compounding the American people into one common mass. Of consequence, when they act, they act in their states. But the measures <span title="123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-123">p. 123</span>they adopt do not, on that account, cease to be the measures of the people themselves, or become the measures of the state governments.</p>
<p id="fb8a2966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From these conventions, the constitution derives its whole authority. The government proceeds directly from the people; is “ordained and established,” in the name of the people; and is declared to be ordained, “in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.” The assent of the states, in their sovereign capacity, is implied, in calling a convention, and thus submitting that instrument to the people. But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it; and their act was final. It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the state governments. The constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the state sovereignties.</p>
<p id="fb8a2967-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been said, that the people had already surrendered all their powers to the state sovereignties, and had nothing more to give. But, surely, the question whether they may resume and modify the powers granted to government, does not remain to be settled in this country. Much more might the legitimacy of the general government be doubted, had it been created by the states. The powers delegated to the state sovereignties were to be exercised by themselves, not by a distinct and independent sovereignty, created by themselves. To the formation of a league, such as was the confederation, the state sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, “in order to form a more perfect union,” it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective government, possessing great and sovereign powers, and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The government of the Union, then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case), is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people. In form, and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.</p>
<p id="fb8a2968-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This government is acknowledged by all, to be one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, would seem too apparent, to have required to be enforced by all those arguments, which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, found it necessary to urge; that principle is now universally admitted. But the question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted, is perpetually arising, and will probably continue to arise, so long as our system shall exist. In discussing these questions, the conflicting powers of the general and state governments must be brought into view, and the supremacy of their respective laws, when they are in opposition, must be settled.</p>
<p id="fb8a2969-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we might expect it would be this—that the government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action. This would seem to result, necessarily, from its nature. It is the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all. Though any one state may be willing to control its operations, no state is willing to allow others to control them. The nation, on those subjects on which it can act, must necessarily bind its component parts. But this question is not left to mere reason: the people have, in express terms, decided it, by saying, “this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof,” “shall be the supreme law of the land,” and by requiring that the members of the state legislatures, and the officers of the executive and judicial departments of the states, <span title="124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-124">p. 124</span>shall take the oath of fidelity to it. The government of the United States, then, though limited in its powers, is supreme; and its laws, when made in pursuance of the constitution, form the supreme law of the land, “anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>
<p id="fb8a296a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Among the enumerated powers, we do not find that of establishing a bank or creating a corporation. But there is no phrase in the instrument which, like the articles of confederation, excludes incidental or implied powers; and which requires that everything granted shall be expressly and minutely described. Even the 10th amendment, which was framed for the purpose of quieting the excessive jealousies which had been excited, omits the word “expressly,” and declares only, that the powers “not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people;” thus leaving the question, whether the particular power which may become the subject of contest, has been delegated to the one government, or prohibited to the other, to depend on a fair construction of the whole instrument. The men who drew and adopted this amendment had experienced the embarrassments resulting from the insertion of this word in the articles of confederation, and probably omitted it, to avoid those embarrassments. A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would, probably, never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires, that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects, be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves. That this idea was entertained by the framers of the American constitution, is not only to be inferred from the nature of the instrument, but from the language. Why else were some of the limitations, found in the 9th section of the 1st article, introduced? It is also, in some degree, warranted, by their having omitted to use any restrictive term which might prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation. In considering this question, then, we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding.</p>
<p id="fb8a296b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although, among the enumerated powers of government, we do not find the word “bank” or “incorporation,” we find the great powers, to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to declare and conduct a war; and to raise and support armies and navies. The sword and the purse, all the external relations, and no inconsiderable portion of the industry of the nation, are intrusted to its government. It can never be pretended, that these vast powers draw after them others of inferior importance, merely because they are inferior. Such an idea can never be advanced. But it may with great reason be contended, that a government, intrusted with such ample powers, on the due execution of which the happiness and prosperity of the nation so vitally depends, must also be intrusted with ample means for their execution. The power being given, it is the interest of the nation to facilitate its execution. It can never be their interest, and cannot be presumed to have been their intention, to clog and embarrass its execution, by withholding the most appropriate means. Can we adopt that construction (unless the words imperiously require it), which would impute to the framers of that instrument, when granting these powers for the public good, the intention of impeding their exercise, by withholding a choice of means? If, indeed, such be the mandate of the constitution, we have only to obey; but that instrument does not profess to enumerate the means by <span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-125">p. 125</span>which the powers it confers may be executed; nor does it prohibit the creation of a corporation, if the existence of such a being be essential, to the beneficial exercise of those powers. It is, then, the subject of fair inquiry, how far such means may be employed.</p>
<p id="fb8a296c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not denied, that the powers given to the government imply the ordinary means of execution. That, for example, of raising revenue, and applying it to national purposes, is admitted to imply the power of conveying money from place to place, as the exigencies of the nation may require, and of employing the usual means of conveyance. The government which has a right to do an act, and has imposed on it, the duty of performing that act, must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means; and those who contend that it may not select any appropriate means, that one particular mode of effecting the object is excepted, take upon themselves the burden of establishing that exception.</p>
<p id="fb8a296d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the constitution of the United States has not left the right of congress to employ the necessary means, for the execution of the powers conferred on the government, to general reasoning. To its enumeration of powers is added, that of making “all laws which shall be necessary and proper, for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department thereof.” The counsel for the state of Maryland have urged various arguments, to prove that this clause, though, in terms, a grant of power, is not so, in effect; but is really restrictive of the general right, which might otherwise be implied, of selecting means for executing the enumerated powers. In support of this proposition, they have found it necessary to contend, that this clause was inserted for the purpose of conferring on congress the power of making laws. That, without it, doubts might be entertained, whether congress could exercise its powers in the form of legislation.</p>
<p id="fb8a296e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the argument on which most reliance is placed, is drawn from that peculiar language of this clause. Congress is not empowered by it to make all laws, which may have relation to the powers confered on the government, but such only as may be “necessary and proper” for carrying them into execution. The word “necessary” is considered as controlling the whole sentence, and as limiting the right to pass laws for the execution of the granted powers, to such as are indispensable, and without which the power would be nugatory. That it excludes the choice of means, and leaves to congress, in each case, that only which is most direct and simple.</p>
<p id="fb8a296f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it true, that this is the sense in which the word “necessary” is always used? Does it always import an absolute physical necessity, so strong, that one thing to which another may be termed necessary, cannot exist without that other? We think it does not. If reference be had to its use, in the common affairs of the world, or in approved authors, we find that it frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another. To employ the means necessary to an end, is generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the end, and not as being confined to those single means, without which the end would be entirely unattainable. Such is the character of human language, that no word conveys to the mind, in all situations, one single definite idea; and nothing is more common than to use words in a figurative sense. Almost all compositions contain words, which, taken in a their rigorous sense, would convey a meaning different from that which is obviously intended. <span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>It is essential to just construction, that many words which import something excessive, should be understood in a more mitigated sense—in that sense which common usage justifies. The word “necessary” is of this description. It has not a fixed character, peculiar to itself. It admits of all degrees of comparison; and is often connected with other words, which increase or diminish the impression the mind receives of the urgency it imports. A thing may be necessary, very necessary, absolutely or indispensably necessary. To no mind would the same idea be conveyed by these several phrases. This word, then, like others, is used in various senses; and, in its construction, the subject, the context, the intention of the person using them, are all to be taken into view.</p>
<p id="fb8a2970-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let this be done in the case under consideration. The subject is the execution of those great powers on which the welfare of a nation essentially depends. It must have been the intention of those who gave these powers, to insure, so far as human prudence could insure, their beneficial execution. This could not be done, by confiding the choice of means to such narrow limits as not to leave it in the power of congress to adopt any which might be appropriate, and which were conducive to the end. This provision is made in a constitution, intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. To have prescribed the means by which government should, in all future time, execute its powers, would have been to change, entirely, the character of the instrument, and give it the properties of a legal code. It would have been an unwise attempt to provide, by immutable rules, for exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for as they occur. To have declared, that the best means shall not be used, but those alone, without which the power given would be nugatory, would have been to deprive the legislature of the capacity to avail itself of experience, to exercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation to circumstances.</p>
<p id="fb8a2971-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, with respect to the whole penal code of the United States: whence arises the power to punish, in cases not prescribed by the constitution? All admit, that the government may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of congress. The right to enforce the observance of law, by punishing its infraction, might be denied, with the more plausibility, because it is expressly given in some cases.</p>
<p id="fb8a2972-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take, for example, the power “to establish post-offices and post-roads.” This power is executed, by the single act of making the establishment. But, from this has been inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail along the post-road, from one post-office to another. And from this implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who steal letters from the post-office, or rob the mail. It may be said, with some plausibility, that the right to carry the mail, and to punish those who rob it, is not indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post-office and post-road. This right is indeed essential to the beneficial exercise of the power, but not indispensably necessary to its existence. So, of the punishment of the crimes of stealing or falsifying a record or process of a court of the United States, or of perjury in such court. To punish these offences, is certainly conducive to the due administration of justice. But courts may exist, and may decide the causes brought before them, though such crimes escape punishment.</p>
<p id="fb8a2973-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ascertaining the sense in which the word “necessary” is used in this clause of the constitution, we may derive some aid from that with which it is associated. Congress shall have power “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper <span title="127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-127">p. 127</span>to carry into execution” the powers of the government. If the word “necessary” was used in that strict and rigorous sense for which the counsel for the state of Maryland contend, it would be an extraordinary departure from the usual course of the human mind, as exhibited in composition, to add a word, the only possible effect of which is, to qualify that strict and rigorous meaning; to present to the mind the idea of some choice of means of legislation, not strained and compressed within the narrow limits for which gentlemen contend.</p>
<p id="fb8a5084-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think so for the following reasons: 1st. The clause is placed among the powers of congress, not among the limitations on those powers. 2d. Its terms purport to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted. No reason has been, or can be assigned, for thus concealing an intention to narrow the discretion of the national legislature, under words which purport to enlarge it. The framers of the constitution wished its adoption, and well knew that it would be endangered by its strength, not by its weakness. Had they been capable of using language which would convey to the eye one idea, and, after deep reflection, impress on the mind, another, they would rather have disguised the grant of power, than its limitation. If, then, their intention had been, by this clause, to restrain the free use of means which might otherwise have been implied, that intention would have been inserted in another place, and would have been expressed in terms resembling these. “In carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all others,” &amp;c., “no laws shall be passed but such as are necessary and proper.” Had the intention been to make this clause restrictive, it would unquestionably have been so in form as well as in effect.</p>
<p id="fb8a5085-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We admit, as all must admit, that the powers of the government are limited, and that its limits are not to be transcended. But we think the sound construction of the constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.</p>
<p id="fb8a5086-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should congress, in the execution of its powers, adopt measures which are prohibited by the constitution; or should congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government; it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a decision come before it, to say, that such an act was not the law of the land. But where the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the government, to undertake here to inquire into the decree of its necessity, would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread on legislative ground. This court disclaims all pretensions to such a power.</p>

<p id="fb8a5088-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the state of Maryland may, without violating the constitution, tax that branch? That the power of taxation is one of vital importance; that it is retained by the states; that it is not abridged by the grant of a similar power to <span title="128" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-128">p. 128</span>the government of the Union; that it is to be concurrently exercised by the two governments—are truths which have never been denied. But such is the paramount character of the constitution, that its capacity to withdraw any subject from the action of even this power, is admitted. The states are expressly forbidden to lay any duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing their inspection laws. If the obligation of this prohibition must be conceded—if it may restrain a state from the exercise of its taxing power on imports and exports—the same paramount character would seem to restrain, as it certainly may restrain, a state from such other exercise of this power, as is in its nature incompatible with, and repugnant to, the constitutional laws of the Union. A law, absolutely repugnant to another, as entirely repeals that other as if express terms of repeal were used.</p>
<p id="fb8a5089-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this ground, the counsel for the bank place its claim to be exempted from the power of a state to tax its operations. There is no express provision for the case, but the claim has been sustained on a principle which so entirely pervades the constitution, is so intermixed with the materials which compose it, so interwoven with its web, so blended with its texture, as to be incapable of being separated from it, without rending it into shreds. This great principle is, that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme; that they control the constitution and laws of the respective states, and cannot be controlled by them. From this, which may be almost termed an axiom, other propositions are deduced as corollaries, on the truth or error of which, and on their application to this case, the cause has been supposed to depend. These are, 1st. That a power to create implies a power to preserve. 2d. That a power to destroy, if wielded by a different hand, is hostile to, and incompatible with these powers to create and to preserve. 3d. That where this repugnancy exists, that authority which is supreme must control, not yield to that over which it is supreme.</p>
<p id="fb8a508a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power of congress to create, and of course, to continue, the bank, was the subject of the preceding part of this opinion; and is no longer to be considered as questionable. That the power of taxing it by the states may be exercised so as to destroy it, is too obvious to be denied. But taxation is said to be an absolute power, which acknowledges no other limits than those expressly prescribed in the constitution, and like sovereign power of every other description, is intrusted to the discretion of those who use it. But the very terms of this argument admit, that the sovereignty of the state, in the article of taxation itself, is subordinate to, and may be controlled by the constitution of the United States. How far it has been controlled by that instrument, must be a question of construction. In making this construction, no principle, not declared, can be admissible, which would defeat the legitimate operations of a supreme government. It is of the very essence of supremacy, to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments, as to exempt its own operations from their own influence. This effect need not be stated in terms. It is so involved in the declaration of supremacy, so necessarily implied in it, that the expression of it could not make it more certain. We must, therefore, keep it in view, while construing the constitution. The argument on the part of the state of Maryland, is, not that the states may directly resist a law of congress, but that they may exercise their acknowledged powers upon it, and that the constitution leaves them this right, in the confidence that they will not abuse it. Before we proceed to examine this argument, <span title="129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-129">p. 129</span>and to subject it to test of the constitution, we must be permitted to bestow a few considerations on the nature and extent of this original right of taxation, which is acknowledged to remain with the states. It is admitted, that the power of taxing the people and their property, is essential to the very existence of government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable, to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to carry it. The only security against the abuse of this power, is found in the structure of the government itself. In imposing a tax, the legislature acts upon its constituents. This is, in general, a sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation.</p>
<p id="fb8a508b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The people of a state, therefore, give to their government a right of taxing themselves and their property, and as the exigencies of government cannot be limited, they prescribe no limits to the exercise of this right, resting confidently on the interest of the legislator, and on the influence of the constituent over their representative, to guard them against its abuse. But the means employed by the government of the Union have no such security, nor is the right of a state to tax them sustained by the same theory. Those means are not given by the people of a particular state, not given by the constituents of the legislature, which claim the right to tax them, but by the people of all the states. They are given by all, for the benefit of all—and upon theory, should be subjected to that government only which belongs to all.</p>
<p id="fb8a508c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be objected to this definition, that the power of taxation is not confined to the people and property of a state. It may be exercised upon every object brought within its jurisdiction. The sovereignty of a state extends to everything which exists by its own authority, or is introduced by its permission; but does it extend to those means which are employed by congress to carry into execution powers conferred on that body by the people of the United States? We think it demonstrable, that it does not. Those powers are not given by the people of a single state. They are given by the people of the United States, to a government whose laws, made in pursuance of the constitution, are declared to be supreme. Consequently, the people of a single state cannot confer a sovereignty which will extend over them.</p>
<p id="fb8a508d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the power to tax involves the power to destroy; that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to create; that there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied. But all inconsistencies are to be reconciled by the magic of the word confidence. Taxation, it is said, does not necessarily and unavoidably destroy. To carry it to the excess of destruction, would be an abuse, to presume which, would banish that confidence which is essential to all government. But is this a case of confidence? Would the people of any one state trust those of another with a power to control the most insignificant operations of their state government? We know they would not. Why, then, should we suppose, that the people of any one state should be willing to trust those of another with a power to control the operations of a government to which they have confided their most important and most valuable interests? In the legislature of the Union alone, are all represented. The legislature of the Union alone, therefore, can be trusted by the people with the power of controlling measures which concern all, in the confidence that it will not be abused. This, then, is not a case of confidence, and we must consider it is as it really is.</p>
<p id="fb8a508e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="130" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-130">p. 130</span>If we apply the principle for which the state of Maryland contends, to the constitution, generally, we shall find it capable of changing totally the character of that instrument. We shall find it capable of arresting all the measures of the government, and of prostrating it at the foot of the states. The American people have declared their constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof, to be supreme; but this principle would transfer the supremacy, in fact, to the states. If the states may tax one instrument, employed by the government in the execution of its powers, they may tax any and every other instrument. They may tax the mail; they may tax the mint; they may tax patent-rights; they may tax the papers of the custom-house; they may tax judicial process; they may tax all the means employed by the government, to an excess which would defeat all the ends of government. This was not intended by the American people. They did not design to make their government dependent on the states.</p>
<p id="fb8a508f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court has bestowed on this subject its most deliberate consideration. The result is a conviction that the states have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government. This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the constitution has declared. We are unanimously of opinion, that the law passed by the legislature of Maryland, imposing a tax on the Bank of the United Sates, is unconstitutional and void.</p>

<p id="fb8a77a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Throughout American history, a central issue has been the extent to which concern over protecting the prerogatives and institutions of state governments should matter in defining the scope of Congress’s legislative power. Should Congress’s authority, under provisions such as the Commerce Clause and the spending power and §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, be narrowly interpreted to leave more governance solely to the states? Or should Congress’s powers be broadly defined without concern for preserving areas for state control? Should the Tenth Amendment be enforced by the judiciary as a limit on Congress’s powers so as to protect state governments? Or should the Tenth Amendment be seen simply as a reminder that Congress can act only if it has express or implied authority, while states can act unless the Constitution prohibits their conduct?</p>
<p id="fb8a77a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are the central questions throughout this chapter, and they are some of the most important in all of constitutional law. As alluded to earlier and as will be evident in the cases to follow, the Court has answered the questions differently at varying points in American history.</p>
<p id="fb8a77a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering these questions and how the Supreme Court has answered them, it is important to recognize that there are two key underlying normative issues. First, how important is the protection of state sovereignty and federalism? Second, should it be the role of the judiciary to protect state prerogatives or should this be left to the political process?</p>
<p id="fb8a77a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the former question, those who oppose judicial protection of states as a limit on Congress’s power argue that national legislation is needed to deal with national problems. From this perspective, the Court should not circumscribe the scope of Congress’s authority or use the Tenth Amendment to invalidate <span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-131">p. 131</span>federal laws. On the other side, those who favor judicial use of federalism as a constraint on Congress’s power usually identify three benefits of protecting state governments: decreasing the likelihood of federal tyranny, enhancing democratic rule by providing government that is closer to the people, and allowing states to be laboratories for new ideas.</p>
<p id="fb8a77a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first justification for protecting states from federal intrusions is that the division of power vertically, between federal and state governments, lessens the chance of federal tyranny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1014F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1014F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> The framers thought that the possibility of federal abuses could be limited by restricting the authority of the federal government.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10158_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10158_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> Moreover, the danger of tyranny at the federal level is much more ominous than autocratic rule at the state or local level. Professor Rapczynski writes, “Should the federal government ever be captured by an authoritarian movement or assert itself as a special cohesive interest, the resulting oppression would almost certainly be much more severe and durable than any state would be capable.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10161_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10161_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8a77aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet others argue that the notion of radically limited federal powers seems anachronistic in the face of a modern national market economy and decades of extensive federal regulations. Additionally, there has been a major shift over time as to how abusive government is best controlled. Now it is thought that if a federal action intrudes upon individual liberties the federal judiciary will invalidate it as unconstitutional. Judicial review is seen as an important check against tyrannical government actions.</p>
<p id="fb8a77ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second frequently invoked value of federalism is that states are closer to the people and thus more likely to be responsive to public needs and concerns.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10171_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10171_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> Professor David Shapiro summarizes this argument when he writes, “[O]ne of the stronger arguments for a decentralized political structure is that, to the extent that the electorate is small, and elected representatives are thus more immediately accountable to individuals and their concerns, government is brought closer to the people and democratic ideals are more fully realized.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10179_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10179_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span> However, there is a danger that the greater responsiveness increases the dangers of government tyranny. There is a greater danger of special interests capturing government at smaller and more local levels. James Madison wrote of the danger of “factions” in Federalist 10 and modern political science literature offers support for his fears.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10182_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10182_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8a9ebf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, it is not clear what size of government unit is necessary for such responsiveness. For example, is a state the size of California, or for that matter a city the size of Los Angeles, sufficiently more homogeneous in its interests as to increase the likelihood of responsive government? Professor Shapiro writes, “[T]he goal of realizing democratic values to the maximum extent feasible may not be significantly enhanced by reducing the relevant polity from one of some 280,000,000 (the United States) to one of, say 30,000,000 (the State of California).”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1018E_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1018E_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8a9ec1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="132" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-132">p. 132</span>A final argument that is frequently made for protecting federalism is that states can serve as laboratories for experimentation. Justice Brandeis apparently first articulated this idea when he declared: “To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment might be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1019B_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1019B_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span> Justice O’Connor stated that the “Court’s decision undermines the most valuable aspects of our federalism. Courts and commentators frequently have recognized that the 50 states serve as laboratories for the development of new social, economic, and political ideas.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101A1_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101A1_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8a9ec4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, any federal legislation preempting state or local laws limits experimentation. Indeed, the application of constitutional rights to the states limits their experimenting with providing fewer safeguards of individual liberties. The key questions are when is it worth experimenting and when is experimentation to be rejected because of a need to impose a national mandate?</p>
<p id="fb8a9ec5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There also is a related process question: Who is in the best position to decide when further experimentation is warranted or when there is enough knowledge to justify federal actions? Critics of judicial protection of states argue that the desire for using states as laboratories is a policy argument to be made to Congress against federal legislation and not a judicial argument that should be used to invalidate particular federal laws on the grounds that they unduly limit experimentation. Additionally, Congress and even federal agencies can design experiments and try differing approaches in varying parts of the country.</p>
<p id="fb8a9ec6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second major question in evaluating judicial protection of states from federal encroachment is whether it should be the role of the judiciary to enforce the Tenth Amendment and protect state sovereignty or whether this is an issue that should be left to the political process. One view is that judicial enforcement of federalism as a limit on Congress is unnecessary because the political process will adequately protect state government interests. Professor Herbert Wechsler, in a landmark article, provided the intellectual foundation for this approach.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101B2_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101B2_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span> Wechsler argued that the interests of the states are represented in the national political process and that the nature of that process provides sufficient protection of state sovereignty, thus making it unnecessary for the courts to enforce federalism as a limit on Congress.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the assumption that states’ interests are adequately represented in the national political process is questionable. At the time the Constitution was written, states chose senators and thus were directly represented in Congress. Today, in contrast, with popular election of senators, it is harder to argue that the states’ interests as states are adequately protected in Congress. It seems unlikely that the voters, in choosing representatives and senators, weigh heavily the extent to which the individual legislator votes in a manner that serves the interests of the state as an entity.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-133">p. 133</span>The remaining material in this chapter concerns how the Supreme Court has defined the scope of Congress’s powers under three crucial constitutional provisions: the commerce power, the spending power, and §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Other issues concerning Congress’s powers, such as the authority to delegate power to administrative agencies and Congress’s role in foreign policy, are discussed in the next chapter.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In examining Congress’s commerce power, its spending power, its authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and its power to authorize suits against state governments, consider how in different time periods the Court has evaluated the importance of protecting state governments and the judicial role in this regard. During some periods, the Court has expansively defined Congress’s authority and refused to use the Tenth Amendment as a limit. During other times, including now, the Court has limited the scope of Congress’s powers and viewed the Tenth Amendment as a constraint on Congress’s authority.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s most recent major decision concerning federalism was National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which addresses the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In it, the justices consider issues concerning the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Commerce Clause, the Spending Power, and the Tenth Amendment. It is presented here, at the beginning of the chapter, with the expectation that each aspect can be considered in connection with the examination of each of these topics in the subsequent sections.</p>

<p id="fb8ac5e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today we resolve constitutional challenges to two provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010: the individual mandate, which requires individuals to purchase a health insurance policy providing a minimum level of coverage; and the Medicaid expansion, which gives funds to the States on the condition that they provide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls below a certain threshold. We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation’s elected leaders. We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain the remainder. In this case we must again determine whether the Constitution grants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many States and individuals believe it does not possess. Resolving this controversy requires us to examine both the limits of the Government’s power, and our own limited role in policing those boundaries.</p>
<p id="fb8ac5e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns two powers that the Constitution does grant the Federal Government, but which must be read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority akin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes Congress <span title="134" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-134">p. 134</span>to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Our precedents read that to mean that Congress may regulate “the channels of interstate commerce,” “persons or things in interstate commerce,” and “those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.” The power over activities that substantially affect interstate commerce can be expansive.</p>
<p id="fb8aecf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Put simply, Congress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal Government considerable influence even in areas where it cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid, or otherwise control. And in exercising its spending power, Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition those offers on compliance with specified conditions. These offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose.</p>
<p id="fb8aecf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.” We have long read this provision to give Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.”</p>
<p id="fb8aecf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our permissive reading of these powers is explained in part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the Nation’s elected leaders. “Proper respect for a coordinate branch of the government” requires that we strike down an Act of Congress only if “the lack of constitutional authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demonstrated.” Members of this Court are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.</p>
<p id="fb8aecf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our deference in matters of policy cannot, however, become abdication in matters of law. “The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.” Marbury v.

<p id="fb8aecfa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act’s 10 titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of provisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p id="fb8aecfb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The individual mandate requires most Americans to maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage. The mandate does not apply to some individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens. Many individuals will <span title="135" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-135">p. 135</span>receive the required coverage through their employer, or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. But for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive health insurance through a third party, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company.</p>
<p id="fb8aecfc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Federal Government. That payment, which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance. In 2016, for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g., prescription drugs and hospitalization). The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner” as tax penalties, such as the penalty for claiming too large an income tax refund. The Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its normal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and levies. And some individuals who are subject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the penalty—for example, those with income below a certain threshold and members of Indian tribes.</p>
<p id="fb8aecfd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the day the President signed the Act into law, Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Those plaintiffs—who are both respondents and petitioners here, depending on the issue—were subsequently joined by 13 more States, several individuals, and the National Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p id="fb8aecfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly challenged here is the Medicaid expansion. Enacted in 1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care. In order to receive that funding, States must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to participate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most States’ total revenue.</p>
<p id="fb8aecff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For example, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults at all. The Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a portion of the costs on their own. If a State does not comply with the Act’s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.</p>

<p id="fb8aed01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have the authority to do so. The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.” This statute protects the Government’s ability to collect a consistent stream of revenue, by barring litigation to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection of taxes. Because of the Anti-Injunction Act, taxes can ordinarily be challenged only after they are paid, by suing for a refund.</p>
<p id="fb8aed02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any <i>tax</i>.” Congress, however, chose to describe the “[s]hared responsibility payment” imposed on those who forgo health insurance not as a “tax,” but as a “penalty.” There is no immediate reason to think that a statute applying to “any tax” would apply to a “penalty.”</p>
<p id="fb8aed03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this suit, and we may proceed to the merits.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fb8b1415-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate. First, the Government argues that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may order individuals to buy health insurance because the failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could undercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms. Second, the Government argues that if the commerce power does not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax. According to the Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so, and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb8b1416-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fb8b1417-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s first argument is that the individual mandate is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. According to the Government, the health care market is characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insurance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to provide a certain degree of care to individuals without regard to their ability to pay, hospitals end up receiving compensation for only a portion of the services they provide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher premiums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompensated care raises family health insurance premiums, on average, by over $1,000 per year.</p>
<p id="fb8b1418-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It did so through the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “community-rating” provisions. These provisions together prohibit insurance companies <span title="137" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-137">p. 137</span>from denying coverage to those with such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher premiums than healthy individuals.</p>
<p id="fb8b1419-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health care needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay purchasing health insurance until they become sick, relying on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage. The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay for their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly increase premiums on everyone.</p>
<p id="fb8b141a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The individual mandate was Congress’s solution to these problems. By requiring that individuals purchase health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by those who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher than their health care expenses. This allows insurers to subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals the reforms require them to accept. The Government claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.</p>

<p id="fb8b141c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government contends that the individual mandate is within Congress’s power because the failure to purchase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting problem. The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, but it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause. We have recognized, for example, that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.” Congress’s power, moreover, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar activities of others.</p>
<p id="fb8b141d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution grants Congress the power to “<i>regulate</i> Commerce.” The power to <i>regulate</i> commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. If the power to “regulate” something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous. For example, the Constitution gives Congress the power to “coin Money,” in addition to the power to “regulate the Value thereof.” And it gives Congress the power to “raise and support Armies” and to “provide and maintain a Navy,” in addition to the power to “make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” If the power to regulate the armed forces or the value of money included the power to bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the specific grant of such powers would have been unnecessary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is already something to be regulated.</p>
<p id="fb8b141e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our precedent also reflects this understanding. As expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: They uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.” It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them.</p>
<p id="fb8b141f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-138">p. 138</span>The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. It instead compels individuals to <i>become</i> active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce. Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely <i>because</i> they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Every day individuals do not do an infinite number of things. In some cases they decide not to do something; in others they simply fail to do it. Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring countless decisions an individual could <i>potentially</i> make within the scope of federal regulation, and—under the Government’s theory—empower Congress to make those decisions for him.</p>
<p id="fb8b1420-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the Government’s logic would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem. To consider a different example in the health care market, many Americans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes up a larger percentage of the total population than those without health insurance. The failure of that group to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance. Those increased costs are borne in part by other Americans who must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the insured. Congress addressed the insurance problem by ordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Government’s theory, Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today. The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions. Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains vested in the States.</p>

<p id="fb8b3b33-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government next contends that Congress has the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”—the guaranteed-issue and community-rating insurance reforms. Under this argument, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an individual’s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles, the individual mandate cannot be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an essential component of the insurance reforms. Each of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b35-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance reforms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the mandate.</p>

<p id="fb8b3b37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is not the end of the matter. Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it is necessary to turn to the Government’s second <span title="139" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-139">p. 139</span>argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.”</p>
<p id="fb8b3b38-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain health insurance, the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes. That, according to the Government, means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a tax—the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory, the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance. Rather, it makes going without insurance just another thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b39-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a “fairly possible” one. As we have explained, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.” The Government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for the reasons set forth below.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fb8b3b3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects. The “[s]hared responsibility payment,” as the statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by “taxpayer[s]” when they file their tax returns. It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code. For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status. The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.” This process yields the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some revenue for the Government. Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion per year by 2017.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act, it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress’s choice of label on that question. That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.</p>
<p id="fb8b3b3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None of this is to say that the payment is not intended to affect individual conduct. Although the payment will raise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to expand health insurance coverage. But taxes that seek to influence conduct are nothing new. Some of our earliest federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of domestic industry. That §5000A seeks to shape decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not mean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing power.</p>
<p id="fb8b624e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in §5000A under the taxing power, and that §5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. That is sufficient to sustain it. The “question of <span title="140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-140">p. 140</span>the constitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it undertakes to exercise.”</p>
<p id="fb8b624f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the taxing power enables Congress to impose a tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must still comply with other requirements in the Constitution. Plaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment does not do so, citing Article I, §9, clause 4. That clause provides: “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.” This requirement means that any “direct Tax” must be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to its population. According to the plaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a direct tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress made no effort to apportion it among the States.</p>
<p id="fb8b6250-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was unclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as a “head tax” or a “poll tax”), might be a direct tax. A tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a capitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person, “without regard to property, profession, or <i>any other circumstance</i>.” The whole point of the shared responsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific circumstances—earning a certain amount of income but not obtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property. The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States.</p>
<p id="fb8b6251-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.</p>

<p id="fb8b6253-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg questions the necessity of rejecting the Government’s commerce power argument, given that §5000A can be upheld under the taxing power. But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it. It is only because the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question. And it is only because we have a duty to construe a statute to save it, if fairly possible, that §5000A can be interreted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving construction.</p>
<p id="fb8b6254-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command. The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.</p>

<p id="fb8b6257-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The States also contend that the Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause. They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a State’s Medicaid grants, unless the State accepts the new expanded funding and complies with <span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-141">p. 141</span>the conditions that come with it. This, they argue, violates the basic principle that the “Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”</p>
<p id="fb8b6258-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid. Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies. But when “pressure turns into compulsion,” the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism. “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.” That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.</p>
<p id="fb8b6259-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Permitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system. “[W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.” Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation, state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when the State has no choice, the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability. Indeed, this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.</p>
<p id="fb8b896a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion is far from the typical case. They object that Congress has “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” in the way it has structured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those States’ existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care coverage effected by the Act.</p>
<p id="fb8b896b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the nature of the threat and the programs at issue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress’s authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States’ complying with restrictions on the use of those funds, because that is the means by which Congress ensures that the funds are spent according to its view of the “general Welfare.” Conditions that do not here govern the use of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that basis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant independent grants, the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes.</p>
<p id="fb8b896c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the financial “inducement” Congress has chosen is much more than “relatively mild encouragement”—it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medicaid Act provides that if a State’s Medicaid plan does not comply with the Act’s requirements, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may declare that “further payments will not be made to the State.” A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not merely “a relatively small percentage” of its existing Medicaid funding, but <i>all</i> of it. Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average <span title="142" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-142">p. 142</span>State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs. The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p id="fb8b896d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the existing program because the States agreed that Congress could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on in the first place. The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree. The original program was designed to cover medical services for four particular categories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and needy families with dependent children. Previous amendments to Medicaid eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of these categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage.</p>

<p id="fb8b896f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.</p>
<p id="fb8b8970-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress’s power to tax.</p>
<p id="fb8b8971-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer. The States are given no such choice in this case: They must either accept a basic change in the nature of Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding. The remedy for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal Government from imposing such a sanction. That remedy does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act.</p>

By any measure, that market is immense. Collectively, Americans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009, accounting for 17.6% of our Nation’s economy. Within the next decade, it is anticipated, spending on health care will nearly double.</p>
<p id="fb8b8979-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The health-care market’s size is not its only distinctive feature. Unlike the market for almost any other product or service, the market for medical care is one in which all individuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person residing in the United States, sooner or later, will visit a doctor or other health-care professional. Most people will do so repeatedly.</p>

<p id="fb8b897b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To manage the risks associated with medical care—its high cost, its unpredictability, and its inevitability—most people in the United States obtain health insurance. Not all U.S. residents, however, have health insurance. In 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured, either by choice or, more likely, because they could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for government aid. As a group, uninsured individuals annually consume more than $100 billion in healthcare services, nearly 5% of the Nation’s total. Over 60% of those without insurance visit a doctor’s office or emergency room in a given year.</p>

Unlike markets for most products, however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that an uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and state law, as well as professional obligations and embedded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the patient’s ability to pay.</p>

In 2008, for <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>example, hospitals, physicians, and other health-care professionals received no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116 billion in care they administered to those without insurance.</p>
<p id="fb8bb08f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Health-care providers do not absorb these bad debts. Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost of uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the government and private insurance companies. In response, private insurers increase their premiums, shifting the cost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who carry insurance. The net result: Those with health insurance subsidize the medical care of those without it. As economists would describe what happens, the uninsured “free ride” on those who pay for health insurance.</p>
<p id="fb8bb090-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The size of this subsidy is considerable. Congress found that the cost-shifting just described “increases family [insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.” Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance less affordable, forcing more people to go without insurance and leading to further cost-shifting.</p>
<p id="fb8bb091-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other deleterious effects on the health-care market. Because those without insurance generally lack access to preventative care, they do not receive treatment for conditions—like hypertension and diabetes—that can be successfully and affordably treated if diagnosed early on. When sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care, once treatable conditions have escalated into grave health problems, requiring more costly and extensive intervention. The extra time and resources providers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers’ ability to care for those who do have insurance.</p>

<p id="fb8bb093-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">States cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on their own. Like Social Security benefits, a universal health-care system, if adopted by an individual State, would be “bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere, encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose.” States that undertake health-care reforms on their own thus risk “placing themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors.” Facing that risk, individual States are unlikely to take the initiative in addressing the problem of the uninsured, even though solving that problem is in all States’ best interests. Congress’ intervention was needed to overcome this collective-action impasse.</p>

<p id="fb8bb095-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To ensure that individuals with medical histories have access to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three-part solution. First, Congress imposed a “guaranteed issue” requirement, which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person on account of that person’s medical condition or history. Second, Congress required insurers to use “community rating” to price their insurance policies. Community rating, in effect, bars insurance companies from charging higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions.</p>
<p id="fb8bb096-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could not work effectively unless individuals were given a powerful incentive to obtain insurance. In the 1990’s, several States—including New York, New Jersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont—enacted guaranteed-issue and community-rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of insurance coverage. The results were disastrous. “All seven states suffered from skyrocketing <span title="145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-145">p. 145</span>insurance premium costs, reductions in individuals with coverage, and reductions in insurance products and providers.”</p>

Whatever one thinks of the policy decision Congress made, it was Congress’ prerogative to make it. Reviewed with appropriate deference, the minimum coverage provision, allied to the guaranteed-issue and community-rating prescriptions, should survive measurement under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses.</p>

<p id="fb8bd7aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, this Court’s pragmatic approach to judging whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power was guided by two familiar principles. First, Congress has the power to regulate economic activities “that substantially affect interstate commerce.” This capacious power extends even to local activities that, viewed in the aggregate, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Second, we owe a large measure of respect to Congress when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Straightforward application of these principles would require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health-care products and services each year. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines. The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emergencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a neighboring State that provides better care for those who have not prepaid for care.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only do those without insurance consume a large amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and stability. Given these far-reaching effects on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing”; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a “reasonable connection” to Congress’ goal of protecting the health-care market from the disruption caused by individuals who fail to obtain insurance. By requiring those who do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum coverage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to insure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe, would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspondingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on the national health-care market.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain insurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier observed, because every person is at risk of needing care at any moment<span title="146" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-146">p. 146</span>, all those who lack insurance, regardless of their current health status, adversely affect the price of health care and health insurance. Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to those in need of immediate care simply could not work. Insurance companies would either charge these individuals prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community-rating regulations were in place, close up shop.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the minimum coverage provision in the manner established by our precedents, the Chief relies on a newly minted constitutional doctrine. The commerce power does not, the Chief Justice announces, permit Congress to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product.”</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chief Justice’s novel constraint on Congress’ commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for that reason alone warrants disapprobation. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product,” such a limitation would be inapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume health-care products and services. Thus, if the Chief Justice is correct that an insurance-purchase requirement can be applied only to those who “actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage provision fits the bill.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage provision “compel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an unwanted product,” or “suite of products.” Virtually everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point in his or her life. Health insurance is a means of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product. Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which individuals pay for an interstate good they consume: Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and through insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate commerce is quintessential economic regulation well within Congress’ domain.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In concluding that the Commerce Clause does not permit Congress to regulate commercial “inactivity,” and therefore does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solution it devised for the health-care problem, the Chief Justice views the Clause as a “technical legal conception,” precisely what our case law tells us not to do. These line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the Court long ago abandoned them.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Underlying the Chief Justice’s view that the Commerce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active participants in a commercial market is a fear that the commerce power would otherwise know no limits. This concern is unfounded. As several times noted, the unique attributes of the health-care market render everyone active in that market and give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor would the commerce power be unbridled, absent the Chief Justice’s “activity” limitation. Congress would remain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is traditionally left to state law.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An individual’s decision to self-insure, I have explained, is an economic act with the requisite connection to interstate commerce. Other choices individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar description.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="147" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-147">p. 147</span>Other provisions of the Constitution also check congressional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particular product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, interfered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8bd7b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Supplementing these legal restraints is a formidable check on congressional power: the democratic process. As the controversy surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act attests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political resistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of state legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned authority to impose mandates, state governments have rarely done so.</p>

<p id="fb8bd7b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons explained above, the minimum coverage provision is valid Commerce Clause legislation. When viewed as a component of the entire ACA, the provision’s constitutionality becomes even plainer.</p>
<p id="fb8bfeca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Necessary and Proper Clause “empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its [commerce] powe[r] that are not within its authority to enact in isolation.” Hence, “[a] complex regulatory program . . . can survive a Commerce Clause challenge without a showing that every single facet of the program is independently and directly related to a valid congressional goal. . . . The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are ‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power.”</p>
<p id="fb8bfecb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall that one of Congress’ goals in enacting the Affordable Care Act was to eliminate the insurance industry’s practice of charging higher prices or denying coverage to individuals with preexisting medical conditions. The commerce power allows Congress to ban this practice, a point no one disputes. But even assuming there were “practicable” alternatives to the minimum coverage provision, “we long ago rejected the view that the Necessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be ‘<i>absolutely</i> necessary’ to the exercise of an enumerated power.” The minimum coverage provision meets this requirement.</p>

<p id="fb8bfece-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, the Court upholds the individual mandate as a proper exercise of Congress’ power to tax and spend “for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.” I concur in that determination, which makes the Chief Justice’s Commerce Clause essay all the more puzzling. Why should the Chief Justice strive so mightily to hem in Congress’ capacity to meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever-developing modern economy? I find no satisfying response to that question in his opinion.</p>

<p id="fb8bfed0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Through Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid of federal financing. The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion, then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger population, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may it achieve the same result by amending existing law? The answer should be that Congress may expand by amendment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid benefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the population served by a federally funded program would advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely serve the interests of federalism. To the contrary, such a requirement would rigidify Congress’ efforts to empower States by partnering with them in the implementation of federal programs.</p>
<p id="fb8bfed1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chief Justice acknowledges that Congress may “condition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States’ complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,” but nevertheless concludes that the 2010 expansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on three premises, each of them essential to his theory. First, the Medicaid expansion is, in the Chief Justice’s view, a new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid program existing before the ACA’s enactment. Second, the expansion was unforeseeable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid. Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the States have no real choice but to participate in the Medicaid expansion. The Chief Justice therefore—<i>for the first time ever</i>—finds an exercise of Congress’ spending power unconstitutionally coercive.</p>
<p id="fb8bfed2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two spending programs; it is a single program with a constant aim—to enable poor persons to receive basic health care when they need it. Given past expansions, plus express statutory warning that Congress may change the requirements participating States must meet, there can be no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice. Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medicaid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds on Congress’ terms. Future Congresses are not bound by their predecessors’ dispositions; they have authority to spend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Government, therefore, is not, as the Chief Justice charges, threatening States with the loss of “existing” funds from one spending program in order to induce them to opt into another program. Congress is simply requiring States to do what States have long been required to do to receive Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress prescribes for participation.</p>
<p id="fb8bfed3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress’ authority to condition the use of federal funds is not confined to spending programs as first launched. The legislature may, and often does, amend the law, imposing new conditions grant recipients henceforth must meet in order to continue receiving funds.</p>
<p id="fb8bfed4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chief Justice ultimately asks whether “the financial inducement offered by Congress . . . pass[ed] the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.” The financial inducement Congress employed here, he concludes, crosses that threshold: The threatened withholding of “existing Medicaid funds” is “a gun to the head” that forces States to acquiesce. When future Spending Clause challenges arrive, as they likely will in the wake of today’s decision, how will litigants and judges assess whether “a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds”? Are courts to measure the <span title="149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-149">p. 149</span>number of dollars the Federal Government might withhold for noncompliance? The portion of the State’s budget at stake? And which State’s—or States’—budget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging States (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal situations), or some national median? Does it matter that Florida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax, and therefore might be able to replace foregone federal funds with new state revenue? Or that the coercion state officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for turning down a politically popular federal grant?</p>
<p id="fb8bfed5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At bottom, my colleagues’ position is that the States’ reliance on federal funds limits Congress’ authority to alter its spending programs. This gets things backwards: Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal money in service of the general welfare. And each successive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees fit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors’ view, it abridged no State’s right to “existing,” or “pre-existing,” funds. For, in fact, there are no such funds. There is only money States <i>anticipate</i> receiving from future Congresses.</p>
<p id="fb8bfed6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated, I agree with the Chief Justice that, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provision, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision encounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid expansion is within Congress’ spending power.</p>

<p id="fb8bfed8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has set out to remedy the problem that the best health care is beyond the reach of many Americans who cannot afford it. It can assuredly do that, by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The question in this case, however, is whether the complex structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go beyond those powers. We conclude that they do.</p>
<p id="fb8c25e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is in one respect difficult: it presents two questions of first impression. The first of those is whether failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect on commerce, and hence might be said to come under this Court’s “affecting commerce” criterion of Commerce Clause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this Court extended the Clause that far. The second question is whether the congressional power to tax and spend, permits the conditioning of a State’s continued receipt of all funds under a massive state-administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal program, but we have never found a law enacted under the spending power to be coercive. Those questions are difficult.</p>
<p id="fb8c25ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case is easy and straightforward, however, in another respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the text of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon federal power—upon what it can prescribe with respect to private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the sovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax and spend, they cannot be such <span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-150">p. 150</span>as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to compel the States to function as administrators of federal programs.</p>
<p id="fb8c25eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding. These parts of the Act are central to its design and operation, and all the Act’s other provisions would not have been enacted without them. In our view it must follow that the entire statute is inoperative.</p>

<p id="fb8c25ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article I, §8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.” The Individual Mandate in the Act commands that every “applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.” If this provision “regulates” anything, it is the <i>failure</i> to maintain minimum essential coverage. One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by payment of a penalty. But that failure—that abstention from commerce—is not “Commerce.” To be sure, <i>purchasing</i> insurance <i>is</i> “Commerce”; but one does not regulate commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.</p>
<p id="fb8c25ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not doubt that the buying and selling of health insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to federal regulation.

If Congress can reach out and command even those furthest removed from an interstate market to participate in the market, then the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton’s words, “the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.” The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C.

It is true enough that everyone consumes “health care,” if the term is taken to include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin. But the health care “market” that is the object of the Individual Mandate not only includes but principally consists of goods and services that the young people primarily affected by the Mandate <i>do not purchase</i>. They are quite simply not participants in that market, and cannot be made so (and thereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of defining participants to include all those who will, later in their lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services covered by the mandated insurance. Such a definition of market participants is <span title="151" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-151">p. 151</span>unprecedented, and were it to be a premise for the exercise of national power, it would have no principled limits.</p>

<p id="fb8c25f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As far as §5000A is concerned, we would stop there. Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its Commerce Clause authority, and §5000A is therefore invalid.</p>
<p id="fb8c25f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering that question we must, if “fairly possible,” construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty, since that would render it constitutional rather than unconstitutional. But we cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. Our cases establish a clear line between a tax and a penalty: “‘[A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government; a penalty . . . is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.’”</p>
<p id="fb8c25f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. The minimum-coverage provision is found in 26 U.S.C. §5000A, entitled “<i>Requirement</i> to maintain minimum essential coverage.” It commands that every “applicable individual <i>shall</i> . . . ensure that the individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage.” And the immediately following provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable individual . . . fails to meet the <i>requirement</i> of subsection (a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a <i>penalty</i>.”</p>
<p id="fb8c25f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quite separately, the fact that Congress (in its own words) “imposed . . . a penalty,” 26 U.S.C. §5000A(b)(1), for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render that failure unlawful. It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: “[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for a lawful act.”</p>
<p id="fb8c25f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a penalty. But we have never—<i>never</i>—treated as a tax an exaction which faces up to the critical difference between a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a “penalty.” Eighteen times in §5000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in §5000A(b) a “penalty.”</p>
<p id="fb8c4d08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have never been popular, and in part for that reason, the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. That is to say, they must originate in the legislative body most accountable to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election, which is never more than two years off. We have no doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="152" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-152">p. 152</span>Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population. Perhaps it is not (we have no need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.</p>

<p id="fb8c4d0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now consider respondents’ second challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act’s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress’ power to attach conditions to federal grants to the States.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go along: termination of all the State’s Medicaid funding. For the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is equal to more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures. A State forced out of the program would not only lose this huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to increase its own health-care expenditures substantially, requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other programs or a large increase in state taxes. And these new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by the State’s citizens to fund the Medicaid program in other States.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This practice of attaching conditions to federal funds greatly increases federal power. “[O]bjectives not thought to be within Article I’s enumerated legislative fields, may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds.” This formidable power, if not checked in any way, would present a grave threat to the system of federalism created by our Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing this potential for abuse, our cases have long held that the power to attach conditions to grants to the States has limits. When federal legislation gives the States a real choice whether to accept or decline a federal aid package, the federal-state relationship is in the nature of a contractual relationship. If a federal spending program coerces participation the States have not “exercise[d] their choice”—let alone made an “informed choice.” Coercing States to accept conditions risks the destruction of the “unique role of the States in our system.” Congress effectively engages in this impermissible compulsion when state participation in a federal spending program is coerced, so that the States’ choice whether to enact or administer a federal regulatory program is rendered illusory.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it is recognized that spending-power legislation cannot coerce state participation, two questions remain: (1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is the ACA’s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now turn to those questions.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb8c4d10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">D</p></div>
<p id="fb8c4d11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer to the first of these questions—the meaning of coercion in the present context—is straightforward. As we have explained, the legitimacy of <span title="153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-153">p. 153</span>attaching conditions to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States’ choice to accept or decline the offered package. Therefore, if States really have no choice other than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power. And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear, theoretical voluntariness is not enough.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the State’s federal highway funds on the State’s adoption of a minimum drinking age of 21 years. The question whether a law enacted under the spending power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but where Congress has plainly “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” a federal program that coopts the States’ political processes must be declared unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Government’s argument in this case at best pays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are “free, <i>as a matter of law</i>, to turn down” federal funds.</p>
<p id="fb8c4d14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and to substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient, withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents to support subsidies to participating States.</p>

<p id="fb8c4d16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether federal spending legislation crosses the line from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine, and courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear. In this case, however, there can be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion. If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case, then there is no such rule.</p>
<p id="fb8c7327-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Medicaid has long been the largest federal program of grants to the States. In 2010, the Federal Government directed more than $552 billion in federal funds to the States. Of this, more than $233 billion went to pre-expansion Medicaid. <i>This amount equals nearly 22% of all state expenditures combined</i>. The States devote a larger percentage of their budgets to Medicaid than to any other item.</p>
<p id="fb8c7328-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any other program. After Medicaid, the next biggest federal funding item is aid to support elementary and secondary education, which amounts to 12.8% of total federal outlays to the States, and equals only 6.6% of all state expenditures combined.</p>
<p id="fb8c7329-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the States—go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding—is quite unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending-power case.</p>
<p id="fb8c732a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-154">p. 154</span>What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal and structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.</p>
<p id="fb8c732b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress’ spending power and cannot be implemented.</p>

<p id="fb8c732d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available.</p>
<p id="fb8c732e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health-care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.</p>
<p id="fb8c732f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers. But the Court’s ruling undermines those values at every turn. In the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional questions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.</p>
<p id="fb8c7330-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times. The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure. Structural protections—notably, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers—are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments. Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most important ones, for which reason they alone were embodied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today’s decision should have vindicated, should have taught, this truth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.</p>
<p id="fb8c7331-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons here stated, we would find the Act invalid in its entirety.</p>

<p id="fb8c7334-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court interprets the “necessary and proper clause” in Article I, §8 as a grant of power to Congress, not a limitation. The Court says that Congress has the power to use any means, not prohibited by the Constitution, to carry out its authority.</p>
<p id="fb8c7335-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, above, five justices rejected the argument that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8c7336-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There have been relatively few decisions in American history interpreting and applying the Necessary and Proper Clause. A recent decision, United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), does so. A federal statute, the Adam Walsh Child Protection Act of 2006, authorized federal courts to order the indefinite confinement of individuals in the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons who are deemed to be “sexually dangerous.” Earlier, in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.A. 346 (1997), the Court ruled that it does not violate due process for a state to indefinitely imprison such individuals even after they have completed their prison sentences. The issue in <i>Comstock</i> is whether Congress had the constitutional authority to provide for such indefinite detentions.</p>
<p id="fb8c7337-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Breyer, upheld the federal law and stressed that this was permissible as an exercise of Congress’s power under the necessary and proper clause. Justice Breyer quoted at length from McCulloch v. Maryland and said: “We have since made clear that, in determining whether the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute, we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means that is rationally related to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power.” The Court explained that “the relevant inquiry is simply ‘whether the means chosen are “reasonably adapted” to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power’ or under other powers that the Constitution grants Congress the authority to implement.”</p>
<p id="fb8c7338-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using this approach, the Court decided that the indefinite commitment of sexually dangerous individuals fits within the scope of the necessary and proper clause. The Court stressed that Congress has the power, under the necessary and proper clause, to prescribe the sanctions for crimes that it creates. Continued commitment of the sexually dangerous fits within the scope of the necessary and proper clause as defined by Chief Justice Marshall in <i>McCulloch.</i> . . .</p>

<p id="fb8c733b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article I, §8 states, “The Congress shall have the power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Practically speaking, this provision has been the authority for a broad array of federal legislation, ranging from criminal statutes to securities laws to civil rights laws to environmental laws. From the perspective of constitutional law, the Commerce Clause has been the focus of the vast majority <span title="156" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-156">p. 156</span>of Supreme Court decisions that have considered the scope of congressional power and federalism.</p>
<p id="fb8c9a4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There have been roughly four eras of Commerce Clause jurisprudence. During the initial era, from early in American history until the 1890s, the commerce power was broadly defined but minimally used. In a period from the 1890s until 1937, the Court narrowly defined the scope of Congress’s commerce power and used the Tenth Amendment as a limit. The era from 1937 until the 1990s was a time when the Court expansively defined the scope of the commerce power and refused to apply the Tenth Amendment as a limit. Since the 1990s, the Court has again narrowed the scope of the commerce power and revived the Tenth Amendment as an independent, judicially enforceable limit on federal actions.</p>
<p id="fb8c9a4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Throughout these eras, the Court is considering three questions. First: What is “commerce”? Is it one stage of business, or does it include all aspects of business—even life in the United States? Second: What does “among the several states” mean? Is it limited to instances where there is a direct effect on interstate commerce, or does any effect on interstate activities suffice? And third: Does the Tenth Amendment limit Congress? If Congress is acting within the scope of its commerce power, can a law be declared unconstitutional as violating the Tenth Amendment?</p>

<p id="fb8c9a5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words are, “Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.” The subject to be regulated is commerce; and our constitution being one of enumeration, and not of definition, to ascertain the extent of the power, it becomes necessary to settle the meaning of the word. The counsel for the appellee would limit it to traffic, to buying and selling, or the interchange of commodities, and do not admit that it comprehends navigation. This would restrict a general term, applicable to many objects, to one of its significations. Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is something more: it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse. The mind can scarcely conceive a system for regulating commerce between nations, which shall exclude all laws concerning navigation, which shall be silent on the admission of the vessels of the one nation into the ports of the other, and be confined to prescribing rules for the conduct of individuals, in the actual employment of buying and selling, or of barter.</p>
<p id="fb8c9a5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If commerce does not include navigation, the government of the Union has no direct power over that subject, and can make no law prescribing what shall constitute American vessels, or requiring that they shall be navigated by American seamen. Yet this power has been exercised from the commencement of the government, has been exercised with the consent of all, and has been understood by all to be a commercial regulation. All America understands, and has uniformly understood, the word “commerce,” to comprehend navigation. It was so understood, and must have been so understood, when the constitution was framed. The power over commerce, including navigation, was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted their government, and must have been contemplated in forming it. The convention must have used the word in that sense, because all have understood it in that sense; and the attempt to restrict it comes too late.</p>
<p id="fb8c9a5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The word used in the constitution, then, comprehends, and has been always understood to comprehend, navigation within its meaning; and a power to regulate navigation, is as expressly granted, as if that term had been added to the word “commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb8cc16d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To what commerce does this power extend? The constitution informs us, to commerce “with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.”</p>
<p id="fb8cc16e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-158">p. 158</span>It has, we believe, been universally admitted, that these words comprehend every species of commercial intercourse between the United States and foreign nations. No sort of trade can be carried on between this country and any other, to which this power does not extend. It has been truly said, that commerce, as the word is used in the constitution, is a unit, every part of which is indicated by the term.</p>
<p id="fb8cc16f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject to which the power is next applied, is to commerce “among the several States.” The word “among” means intermingled with. A thing which is among others, is intermingled with them. Commerce among the States, cannot stop at the external boundary line of each State, but may be introduced into the interior.</p>
<p id="fb8cc170-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States. Such a power would be inconvenient, and is certainly unnecessary.</p>
<p id="fb8cc171-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comprehensive as the word “among” is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than one. The phrase is not one which would probably have been selected to indicate the completely interior traffic of a State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and the enumeration of the particular classes of commerce, to which the power was to be extended, would not have been made, had the intention been to extend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerce of a State. The genius and character of the whole government seem to be, that its action is to be applied to all the external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the States generally; but not to those which are completely within a particular State, which do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the government. The completely internal commerce of a State, then, may be considered as reserved for the State itself.</p>
<p id="fb8cc172-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, in regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several States. It would be a very useless power, if it could not pass those lines. The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, is that of the whole United States. Every district has a right to participate in it. The deep streams which penetrate our country in every direction, pass through the interior of almost every State in the Union, and furnish the means of exercising this right. If Congress has the power to regulate it, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists. If it exists within the States, if a foreign voyage may commence or terminate at a port within a State, then the power of Congress may be exercised within a State.</p>
<p id="fb8cc173-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are now arrived at the inquiry—What is this power?</p>
<p id="fb8cc174-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution. If, as has always been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government, having in its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>power as are found in the constitution of the United States. The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely, in all representative governments.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fb8cc175-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the remainder of the nineteenth century, until the 1890s, there were relatively few cases considering the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause power. In the years after <i>Gibbons</i> and before the Civil War, the Supreme Court rarely considered challenges to federal legislation adopted under Congress’s Commerce Clause authority. After the Civil War, there were a few cases concerning the scope of the commerce power. Some of the cases continued <i>Gibbons</i>’s expansive definition of commerce. For example, in <i>The Daniel Ball</i>, 77 U.S. (1 Wall.) 557 (1871), the Court accorded Congress broad authority to license ships, even those operating entirely intrastate, as long as the boats were carrying goods that had come from another state or that ultimately would go to another state. The Court explained that unsafe ships in intrastate commerce could affect and harm ships in interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8cc176-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet there also were a few cases that departed from <i>Gibbons</i> and invalidated federal legislation as exceeding the scope of the commerce power. The first case to overturn a federal law in this way was United States v. Dewitt, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 41 (1869), in 1870. A federal law outlawed the sale of naphtha and other illuminating oils that could ignite at less than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The Court held that the law was “a police regulation, relating exclusively to the internal trade of the States.” In a precursor to decisions that followed after the 1890s, the Court declared the law unconstitutional because it was “a virtual denial of any power to interfere with the internal trade and business of the separate States.”</p>
<p id="fb8cc177-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>The Trademark Cases</i>, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 82 (1878), the Court invalidated the federal law that established a federal system for registering trademarks. The Court concluded that the law was unconstitutional because it applied to wholly intrastate businesses and business transactions and therefore “is obviously the exercise of a power not confided to Congress.”</p>

<p id="fb8cc17a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late nineteenth century, concurrent with the Industrial Revolution and the growth of the national economy, Congress began using the Commerce Clause much more extensively to regulate businesses. The Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 was largely meant to provide for federal regulation of railroads, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 was intended to combat monopolies and restraints of trade.</p>
<p id="fb8cc17b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the 1890s, the Supreme Court narrowly interpreted the scope of Congress’s commerce power and used the Tenth Amendment as an independent constraint on congressional authority. Between the late nineteenth century and 1937, the Court was controlled by conservative justices deeply committed to laissez-faire economics and strongly opposed to government <span title="160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-160">p. 160</span>economic regulations. Many federal laws were invalidated as exceeding the scope of Congress’s commerce power or as violating the Tenth Amendment and the zone of activities reserved to the states. Many state laws were invalidated as interfering with freedom of contract, which the Court found to be protected as a fundamental right under the liberty of the Due Process Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10631_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10631_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span> So, for example, a federal law requiring a minimum wage during this period would be invalidated as exceeding the scope of Congress’s power and as usurping states’ prerogatives;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10637_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10637_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span> a state law requiring a minimum wage would be invalidated as impermissibly interfering with freedom of contract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1063F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1063F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8ce88f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This era of constitutional law is extremely important. It was the first time that the Supreme Court aggressively used its power of judicial review to invalidate federal and state laws. Constitutional law since 1937 has very much been a reaction to this earlier era. The Court did not invalidate another law as exceeding the scope of the Commerce Clause until 1995<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1064A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1064A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> and has generally very much deferred to federal and state economic regulations.</p>
<p id="fb8ce891-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although appreciating and understanding constitutional law in this era requires looking at all of these cases together, this chapter focuses solely on the decisions concerning the scope of Congress’s power. The Court’s use of freedom of contract during this time period as a limit on state power is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p id="fb8ce892-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between the late nineteenth century and 1937, the Court espoused a philosophy often termed “dual federalism.” Dual federalism was the view that the federal and state governments were separate sovereigns, that each had separate zones of authority, and that it was the judicial role to protect the states by interpreting and enforcing the Constitution to protect the zone of activities reserved to the states.</p>
<p id="fb8ce893-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dual federalism was embodied in three important doctrines that the Court developed and followed during this time period. First, the Court narrowly defined the meaning of <i>commerce</i> so as to leave a zone of power to the states. Specifically, as described below, the Court held that commerce was one stage of business, distinct from earlier phases such as mining, manufacturing, or production. Under this view, only commerce itself could be regulated by Congress; the others were left for state regulation.</p>
<p id="fb8ce894-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court restrictively defined <i>among the states</i> as allowing Congress to regulate only when there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce. In all other areas, regulation again was left to the states.</p>
<p id="fb8ce895-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court held that the Tenth Amendment reserved a zone of activities to the states and that even federal laws within the scope of the commerce clause were unconstitutional if they invaded that zone. For example, the Court held that regulation of production was left to the states, and therefore a federal law that prohibited shipment in interstate commerce of goods made by child labor was unconstitutional, even though it was limited to interstate commerce, because it violated the Tenth Amendment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1066A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1066A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span></p>

However, it should be noted at the outset that the Court was not completely consistent in applying these principles. The Court was most likely to follow them when considering federal economic regulations; the Court was least likely to adhere to them, and most willing to uphold federal laws, when they concerned federal morals regulation. Thus, as described below, the Court invalidated federal antitrust laws<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10677_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10677_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span> and employment regulation statutes<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1067D_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1067D_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">17</a></span> but upheld federal laws prohibiting lotteries<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10685_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10685_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span> and regulating sexual behavior.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1068B_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1068B_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> Perhaps a principled distinction between these cases can be articulated, or more likely, the decisions were simply a product of the Court’s particular brand of conservatism—economically conservative and thus aggressive in striking down economic regulations, morally conservative and thus deferential to laws directed at what was perceived as sin.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="fb8d0fac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb8d0fad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">a.&nbsp;What Is “Commerce”?</p></div>
<p id="fb8d0fae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three doctrines described above created a powerful limit on the scope of Congress’s power. First, the Court held that <i>commerce</i> was to be narrowly defined as one stage of business, separate and distinct from earlier phases such as mining, manufacturing, and production. In United States v. E.C. Knight, 156 U.S. 1 (1895), toward the beginning of this era, the Court held that the Sherman Antitrust Act could not be used to stop a monopoly in the sugar refining industry because the Constitution did not allow Congress to regulate manufacturing. The U.S. government attempted to use the Sherman Antitrust Act to block the American Sugar Refining Company from acquiring four competing refineries. The acquisition would have given the company control of over 98 percent of the sugar refining industry.</p>
<p id="fb8d0faf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, the Court held that federal law could not be applied because the monopoly was in the production of sugar, not in its commerce. The Court flatly declared, “Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.” The Court was clear that this rigid distinction was based on a need for preserving a zone of activities to the states. The Court explained that although the commerce power was one of the “strongest bond[s] of the union, . . . the preservation of the autonomy of the States [w]as required by our dual form of government.”</p>
<p id="fb8d0fb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This distinction between manufacturing and commerce seems arbitrary; a company would desire a monopoly in production because it would benefit from monopoly profits in commerce. The Court acknowledged this but said that the relationship was too indirect to allow federal regulation under the commerce power. The Court said that it would be “far-reaching” to allow Congress to act “whenever interstate or international commerce may be ultimately affected.” The Court explained that the effect on commerce was only “indirect” and thus outside the scope of federal power.</p>
<p id="fb8d0fb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>This very limited definition of commerce continued throughout this era until 1937. For example, in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), the Court declared unconstitutional the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935. The law contained detailed findings as to the relationship between coal and the national economy and declared that the production of coal directly affected interstate commerce. The law provided for local coal boards to be established to determine prices for coal and to determine, after collective bargaining by unions and employers, wages and hours for employees. A shareholder in the Carter Coal Company sued it to stop it from complying with the law.</p>
<p id="fb8d0fb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Sutherland, declared the law unconstitutional. The Court focused on the unconstitutionality of federal regulation of wages and hours. The Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb8d36c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[C]ommerce is the equivalent of the phrase “intercourse for the purposes of trade.” Plainly, the incidents leading up to and culminating in the mining of coal do not constitute such intercourse. The employment of men, the fixing of their wages, hours of labor and working conditions, the bargaining in respect of these things—whether carried on separately or collectively—each and all constitute intercourse for the purposes of production, not of trade. . . . Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it.</p>
</div>
<p id="fb8d36c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court again emphasized that this narrow definition of commerce was essential to protect the states. The Court lamented, “Every journey to a forbidden end begins with the first step; and the danger of such a step by the federal government in the direction of taking over the powers of the states is that the end of the journey may find the states so despoiled of their powers, or—what may amount to the same thing—so relieved of responsibilities . . . as to reduce them to little more than geographic subdivisions of the national domain.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Decisions such as <i>E.C. Knight</i> and <i>Carter</i> rest on many assumptions: that it makes sense to distinguish commerce from other stages of business, that the Constitution requires that a rigid zone of activities be left to the states, and that it is the judicial role to protect this zone. From the late nineteenth century until 1937, these premises were fervently accepted by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p id="fb8d36c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second major aspect of the Court’s approach to the Commerce Clause during this era was the requirement that there be a direct effect on interstate commerce. For example, in the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases</i>, 234 U.S. 342 (1914), the Court upheld the ability of the Interstate Commerce Commission to set intrastate railroad rates because of their direct impact on interstate commerce. Specifically, a railroad was ordered to charge the same rates for shipments to Marshall, Texas, whether from Shreveport, Louisiana, or from Dallas, Texas. The Court upheld the federal regulation and held that “Congress in the exercise of its paramount power may prevent the common instrumentalities of interstate and intrastate commercial intercourse from being used in their intrastate operations to the injury of interstate commerce.” The Court said that Congress “does possess the power to foster and protect interstate commerce, and to take all measures necessary or appropriate to that end, although intrastate transactions of interstate carriers may thereby be controlled.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="163" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-163">p. 163</span>The distinction between direct and indirect effects is inherently elusive and difficult to draw. In contrast to the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases</i>, A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), often referred to as the “sick chickens” case, declared a federal law unconstitutional based on an insufficient effect on interstate commerce. The National Industrial Recovery Act, a key piece of New Deal legislation, authorized the president to approve “codes of fair competition” developed by boards of various industries. Pursuant to this law, the president approved a Live Poultry Code for New York City. In part, the code was designed to ensure quality poultry by preventing sellers from requiring buyers to purchase the entire coop of chickens, including sick ones. The code also regulated employment by requiring collective bargaining, prohibiting child labor, and establishing a 40-hour workweek and a minimum wage.</p>
<p id="fb8d36ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court declared the code unconstitutional because there was not a sufficiently “direct” relationship to interstate commerce. Although the Court acknowledged that virtually all of the poultry in New York was shipped from other states, the Court said that the code was not regulating the interstate transactions; rather, the code concerned the operation of businesses within New York. The Court emphasized that Congress only could regulate when there was a direct effect on interstate commerce. The Court explained, “In determining how far the federal government may go in controlling intrastate transactions upon the ground that they ‘affect’ interstate commerce, there is a necessary and well-established distinction between direct and indirect effects.” The federal government has the authority to regulate when there are direct effects on commerce, “[b]ut where the effect of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce is merely indirect, such transactions remain within the domain of state power.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court once again explained that this distinction was essential to protect state governments and ultimately the American system of government. The Court stated, “If the commerce clause were construed to reach all enterprises and transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people and the authority of the State over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government.” The Court thus declared that enforcing the distinction between direct and indirect effects on commerce “must be recognized as . . . essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty, of course, is in drawing a meaningful and useful distinction between direct and indirect effects. The Court struggled with this throughout the era. One approach that the Court often used was to allow Congress to regulate to protect the stream of commerce. The Court initially articulated this approach in Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375 (1905), which upheld the application of the Sherman Antitrust Act to an agreement among meat dealers to fix the price at which they would purchase meat from stockyards. Although the stockyard was intrastate, the Court stressed how it was only a temporary stop for the cattle. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, explained that the stockyards were in “a current of commerce among the States, and the purchase of the cattle is a part and incident of such commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495 (1922), for example, the Court upheld the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which authorized the secretary of commerce to regulate rates and prescribe standards for the operation of stockyards where livestock was kept. The law was designed to protect consumers <span title="164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-164">p. 164</span>by lessening collusion between stockyard managers and packers and also by decreasing the ability of packers to set prices for livestock. The Supreme Court upheld the federal law emphasizing that the stockyards are in the stream of commerce. Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court, explained that the “stockyards are but a throat through which the current flows, and the transactions which occur therein are only incident to this current from the West to the East, and from one State to another. Such transactions can not be separated from the movement to which they contribute and necessarily take on its character.”</p>
<p id="fb8d36ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court relied on this stream of commerce approach to allow Congress to prohibit the sale of impure or adulterated food or drugs,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106F6_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106F6_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">20</a></span> to require retail labeling for items traveling in interstate commerce,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106FC_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106FC_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">21</a></span> and to restrict the sale of intoxicating beverages to Indians.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10702_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10702_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span></p>
<p id="fb8d5de2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, however, did not consistently apply its stream of commerce approach. For example, in Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R.R. Co., 295 U.S. 330 (1935), the Court declared unconstitutional the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934, which provided a pension system for railroad workers. Railroads obviously were part of the stream of interstate commerce, and the Court had upheld other federal regulations of railroads. In Southern Railway v. United States, 222 U.S. 20 (1911), the Court upheld the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, which regulated couplers on railroad cars. In Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 221 U.S. 612 (1911), the Court upheld a federal law that set maximum hours for railroad workers.</p>
<p id="fb8d5de3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet in the <i>Alton R.R. Co.</i> case the Court struck down the requirement for a pension for railroad workers and distinguished the other cases as concerning the safety or efficiency of the railroads. The Court said that Congress could not use its commerce power to require a pension program for railroad employees because the law was only to help “the social welfare of the worker, and therefore [was] remote from any regulation of commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb8d5de4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key point is that the Court interpreted “among the states” as requiring a direct effect on interstate commerce. Yet the Court never formulated a clear or consistent way to distinguish direct from indirect effects. Why did intrastate railroad rates have a direct effect on interstate commerce, while regulations designed to limit the shipment of sick chickens in interstate commerce have only an indirect effect? The stream of commerce approach was sometimes used during this era to evaluate whether an activity was among the states. Yet the Court was no more consistent in applying this test. Why are prices at stockyards in the stream of commerce but practices at poultry farms not part of that stream?</p>

<p id="fb8d5de7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court held that even if an activity was commerce and was among the states, Congress still could not regulate if it was intruding into the zone of activities reserved to the states. The Court concluded that the Tenth Amendment reserved control of activities such as mining, manufacturing, and production to the states. Even federal laws regulating commerce among <span title="165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-165">p. 165</span>the states were unconstitutional if they sought to control mining, manufacturing, and production.</p>
<p id="fb8d5de8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Child Labor Case</i> (Hammer v. Dagenhart), 247 U.S. 251 (1918), was the most significant decision to use the Tenth Amendment in this way. A federal law prohibited the shipment in interstate commerce of goods produced in factories that employed children under age 14 or employed children between the ages of 14 and 16 for more than eight hours per day or six days a week. Although the law only regulated goods in interstate commerce, the Court declared it unconstitutional because it controlled production. The Court declared that “[t]he grant of power to Congress over the subject of interstate commerce was to enable it to regulate such commerce, and not to give it authority to control the States in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture.” The Court said that regulating the hours of labor of children was entrusted “purely [to] state authority.” The Court expressly rejected the argument that federal legislation was necessary to prevent unfair competition; states that wanted to outlaw child labor would find it difficult to do so as long as other states allowed child labor.</p>
<p id="fb8d5de9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the Court spoke in apocalyptic terms as to the consequences if Congress was accorded such regulatory power: “The far reaching result of upholding the act cannot be more plainly indicated than by pointing out that if Congress can thus regulate matters entrusted to local authority by prohibition of the movement of commodities in interstate commerce, all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the States over local matters may be eliminated, and thus our system of government be practically destroyed.”</p>
<p id="fb8d5dea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Child Labor Case</i> can be contrasted to another decision from that era, <i>The Lottery Case</i> (Champion v. Ames), 188 U.S. 321 (1903), in which the Court upheld a federal law prohibiting the interstate shipment of lottery tickets. In both <i>The Child Labor Case</i> and <i>The Lottery Case</i>, the federal law prohibited the shipment of a specified item—goods made by child labor or lottery tickets—in interstate commerce. In both, Congress obviously was seeking to stop intrastate activities: the use of child labor and gambling in lotteries. Yet in the former the Court declared the federal law unconstitutional, whereas in the latter the Court upheld the federal law.</p>
<p id="fb8d5deb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>The Lottery Case</i>, the Court made it clear that the power to regulate interstate commerce includes the ability to prohibit items from being in interstate commerce. The Court concluded that it was within Congress’s Commerce Clause power to stop lottery tickets from being a part of interstate commerce. The Court declared, “If a State, when considering legislation for the suppression of lotteries within its own limits, may properly take into view the evils that inhere in the raising of money, in that mode, why may not Congress, invested with power to regulate commerce among the several States, provide that such commerce shall not be polluted by the carrying of lottery tickets from one State to another?”</p>
<p id="fb8d5dec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court explicitly rejected the argument that the federal law violated the Tenth Amendment and intruded on state government prerogatives. Also, the Court rejected the argument that according Congress such power would give Congress seemingly limitless authority and would endanger the constitutional structure. The Court simply said, “[T]he possible abuse of a power is not an argument against its existence.”</p>
<p id="fb8d5ded-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="166" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-166">p. 166</span>Thus, the Court did not consistently define the zone of activities reserved to the states. Yet the Court during this era clearly believed in dual sovereignty and used it to limit federal power.</p>
<p id="fb8d5dee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps there are principled distinctions between these cases, or perhaps they simply reflect a conservative Court much more willing to defer to morals laws than to economic regulations. Whatever the cause, these three doctrines—the narrow definition of commerce, the restrictive interpretation of among the states, and the use of state sovereignty as a constraint on congressional power—all advanced dual federalism and all limited the scope of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p id="fb8d5df1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the mid-1930s, there were enormous pressures for a change in the Supreme Court’s narrow approach to defining the scope of Congress’s power. It must be remembered that during this time the Court also was narrowly interpreting the scope of other congressional powers, such as the spending power (discussed below), and greatly restricting the ability of state governments to regulate the economy by protecting freedom of contract under substantive due process (discussed in Chapter 6).</p>
<p id="fb8d8502-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The economic crisis caused by the Depression made the Supreme Court’s hostility to economic regulation and its commitment to a laissez-faire economy seem anachronistic and harmful. Unemployment was widespread, and the wages of those with jobs were low. Business failure was endemic, and production was substantially lessened. Foreclosures of home and farm mortgages were common.</p>
<p id="fb8d8503-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Strong political pressure developed for change. President Franklin Roosevelt won a landslide reelection victory in 1936 and saw this as a strong endorsement for the New Deal programs that the Court was invalidating, such as in Carter v. Carter Coal and Schechter Poultry v. United States. In March 1937, Roosevelt proposed that Congress adopt legislation to increase the size of the Supreme Court. Under the proposal, one justice would be added to the Court for each justice over age 70, up to a maximum of 15 justices. In light of the ages of the justices then on the Court, Roosevelt would have been able to add six new justices and thus secure a majority on the Court to uphold the New Deal programs.</p>
<p id="fb8d8504-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Roosevelt’s Court-packing plan drew intense opposition, even from some supporters of New Deal programs, on the ground that it was a threat to the independence of the federal judiciary. It is worth noting, however, that nothing in the Constitution mandated or even suggested a number of justices for the Court. The first Judiciary Act prescribed a Court of six. This was temporarily reduced to five in 1801 and increased back to six in 1802. The number of justices was increased to seven in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1864. Generally, the increase in the size of the Court was a result of the addition of a new federal circuit court of appeals. Supreme Court justices were responsible for “riding circuit” and sitting as federal appeals court judges; an additional justice was created each time the country expanded and a new circuit was added.</p>
<p id="fb8d8505-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1866, with unpopular President Andrew Johnson in the White House, Congress reduced the size of the Supreme Court to seven. This kept Johnson from filling an existing vacancy on the Court and meant that the next two <span title="167" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-167">p. 167</span>vacancies also would go unfilled in order to bring the Court’s size down from ten to seven. In 1869, after Ulysses Grant became president, the number on the Court was increased to nine, where it has been ever since.</p>
<p id="fb8d8506-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the number of justices was not specified in the Constitution, Roosevelt’s Court-packing plan was intensely opposed as a threat to judicial independence. In 1937, Justice Owen Roberts changed his position and was the fifth to uphold two laws of the type that previously had been invalidated: a state minimum wage law for women and a federal law regulating labor relations.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10776_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10776_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> There is a debate over whether Roberts was influenced by the political pressure of the Court-packing plan or whether he planned to change his vote prior to Roosevelt’s proposal. Whatever the cause, Roberts’s change in sentiment will forever be known as “the switch in time that saved nine.”</p>

<p id="fb8d850a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three decisions—NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. in 1937, United States v. Darby in 1941, and Wickard v. Filburn in 1942—overruled the earlier era of decisions and expansively defined the scope of Congress’s commerce power. Indeed, because of these three decisions, from 1937 until 1995, not one federal law was declared unconstitutional as exceeding the scope of Congress’s commerce power. These three key rulings are presented and then followed by consideration of how the Court defined “commerce among the states” after these decisions and how the Court treated the Tenth Amendment prior to the 1990s.</p>

<p id="fb8d8511-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a proceeding under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 the National Labor Relations Board found that the respondent, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, had violated the act by engaging in unfair labor practices affecting commerce. The unfair labor practices charged were that the corporation was discriminating against members of the union with regard to hire and tenure of employment, and was coercing and intimidating its employees in order to interfere with their self-organization. The discriminatory and coercive action alleged was the discharge of certain employees.</p>
<p id="fb8dac22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts as to the nature and scope of the business of the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation have been found by the Labor Board, and, so far as they are essential to the determination of this controversy, they are not in dispute. The corporation is organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and has its principal office at Pittsburgh. It is engaged in the business of manufacturing iron and steel in plants situated in Pittsburgh and nearby Aliquippa, Pa. It manufactures and distributes a widely diversified line of steel and pig iron, being the fourth largest producer of steel in the United States. With its <span title="168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-168">p. 168</span>subsidiaries—nineteen in number—it is a completely integrated enterprise, owning and operating ore, coal and limestone properties, lake and river transportation facilities and terminal railroads located at its manufacturing plants. It owns or controls mines in Michigan and Minnesota. It operates four ore steamships on the Great Lakes, used in the transportation of ore to its factories. It owns coal mines in Pennsylvania. It operates towboats and steam barges used in carrying coal to its factories. It owns limestone properties in various places in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It owns the Monongahela connecting railroad which connects the plants of the Pittsburgh works and forms an interconnection with the Pennsylvania, New York Central and Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad systems. It owns the Aliquippa &amp; Southern Railroad Company, which connects the Aliquippa works with the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie, part of the New York Central system. Much of its product is shipped to its warehouses in Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and Memphis,—to the last two places by means of its own barges and transportation equipment. In Long Island City, New York, and in New Orleans it operates structural steel fabricating shops in connection with the warehousing of semifinished materials sent from its works. Through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries it owns, leases, and operates stores, warehouses, and yards for the distribution of equipment and supplies for drilling and operating oil and gas wells and for pipe lines, refineries and pumping stations. It has sales offices in twenty cities in the United States and a wholly-owned subsidiary which is devoted exclusively to distributing its product in Canada. Approximately 75 percent of its product is shipped out of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="fb8dac23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Summarizing these operations, the Labor Board concluded that the works in Pittsburgh and Aliquippa “might be likened to the heart of a self- contained, highly integrated body. They draw in the raw materials from Michigan, Minnesota, West Virginia, Pennsylvania in part through arteries and by means controlled by the respondent; they transform the materials and then pump them out to all parts of the nation through the vast mechanism which the respondent has elaborated.”</p>
<p id="fb8dac24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To carry on the activities of the entire steel industry, 33,000 men mine ore, 44,000 men mine coal, 4,000 men quarry limestone, 16,000 men manufacture coke, 343,000 men manufacture steel, and 83,000 men transport its product. Respondent has about 10,000 employees in its Aliquippa plant, which is located in a community of about 30,000 persons.</p>
<p id="fb8dac25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The act is challenged in its entirety as an attempt to regulate all industry, thus invading the reserved powers of the States over their local concerns. It is asserted that the references in the act to interstate and foreign commerce are colorable at best; that the act is not a true regulation of such commerce or of matters which directly affect it, but on the contrary has the fundamental object of placing under the compulsory supervision of the federal government all industrial labor relations within the nation.</p>
<p id="fb8dac26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If this conception of terms, intent and consequent inseparability were sound, the act would necessarily fall by reason of the limitation upon the federal power which inheres in the constitutional grant, as well as because of the explicit reservation of the Tenth Amendment. The authority of the federal government may not be pushed to such an extreme as to destroy the distinction, which the commerce clause itself establishes, between commerce “among the several States” and the internal concerns of a state. That distinction between what is national <span title="169" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-169">p. 169</span>and what is local in the activities of commerce is vital to the maintenance of our federal system.</p>
<p id="fb8dac27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it clear that the National Labor Relations Act may be construed so as to operate within the sphere of constitutional authority. There can be no question that the commerce thus contemplated by the act (aside from that within a Territory or the District of Columbia) is interstate and foreign commerce in the constitutional sense. The act also defines the term “affecting commerce”: “The term ‘affecting commerce’ means in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce, or having led or tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb8dac28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This definition is one of exclusion as well as inclusion. The grant of authority to the Board does not purport to extend to the relationship between all industrial employees and employers. Its terms do not impose collective bargaining upon all industry regardless of effects upon interstate or foreign commerce. It purports to reach only what may be deemed to burden or obstruct that commerce and, thus qualified, it must be construed as contemplating the exercise of control within constitutional bounds. It is a familiar principle that acts which directly burden or obstruct interstate or foreign commerce, or its free flow, are within the reach of the congressional power. Acts having that effect are not rendered immune because they grow out of labor disputes. It is the effect upon commerce, not the source of the injury, which is the criterion.</p>
<p id="fb8dac29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent says that, whatever may be said of employees engaged in interstate commerce, the industrial relations and activities in the manufacturing department of respondent’s enterprise are not subject to federal regulation. The argument rests upon the proposition that manufacturing in itself is not commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8dac2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The congressional authority to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions is not limited to transactions which can be deemed to be an essential part of a “flow” of interstate or foreign commerce. Burdens and obstructions may be due to injurious action springing from other sources. The fundamental principle is that the power to regulate commerce is the power to enact “all appropriate legislation” for its “protection or advancement”; to adopt measures “to promote its growth and insure its safety”; “to foster, protect, control, and restrain.” That power is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce “no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it.” Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control.</p>
<p id="fb8dac2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The close and intimate effect which brings the subject within the reach of federal power may be due to activities in relation to productive industry although the industry when separately viewed is local. It is thus apparent that the fact that the employees here concerned were engaged in production is not determinative. The question remains as to the effect upon interstate commerce of the labor practice involved.</p>
<p id="fb8dac2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Giving full weight to respondent’s contention with respect to a break in the complete continuity of the “stream of commerce” by reason of respondent’s manufacturing operations, the fact remains that the stoppage of those operations by industrial strife would have a most serious effect upon interstate <span title="170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-170">p. 170</span>commerce. In view of respondent’s far-flung activities, it is idle to say that the effect would be indirect or remote. It is obvious that it would be immediate and might be catastrophic. We are asked to shut our eyes to the plainest facts of our national life and to deal with the question of direct and indirect effects in an intellectual vacuum. Because there may be but indirect and remote effects upon interstate commerce in connection with a host of local enterprises throughout the country, it does not follow that other industrial activities do not have such a close and intimate relation to interstate commerce as to make the presence of industrial strife a matter of the most urgent national concern. When industries organize themselves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate commerce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be maintained that their industrial labor relations constitute a forbidden field into which Congress may not enter when it is necessary to protect interstate commerce from the paralyzing consequences of industrial war?</p>
<p id="fb8dac2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Experience has abundantly demonstrated that the recognition of the right of employees to self-organization and to have representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining is often an essential condition of industrial peace. Refusal to confer and negotiate has been one of the most prolific causes of strife.</p>
<p id="fb8dac2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">McReynolds</span> delivered the following dissenting opinion.</p>
<p id="fb8dac2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Van Devanter, Justice Sutherland, Justice Butler and I are unable to agree with the decisions just announced. The Court as we think departs from well-established principles followed in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, and Carter v. Carter Coal Co. In each cause the Labor Board formulated and then sustained a charge of unfair labor practices towards persons employed only in production. It ordered restoration of discharged employees to former positions with payment for losses sustained. These orders were declared invalid below upon the ground that respondents while carrying on production operations were not thereby engaging in interstate commerce; that labor practices in the course of such operations did not directly affect interstate commerce; consequently respondents’ actions did not come within congressional power.</p>
<p id="fb8dac30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The wide sweep of the statute will more readily appear if consideration be given to the Board’s proceedings against the smallest and relatively least important—the Clothing Company. If the act applies to the relations of that Company to employees in production, of course it applies to the larger respondents with like business elements although the affairs of the latter may present other characteristics. Though differing in some respects, all respondents procure raw materials outside the state where they manufacture, fabricate within and then ship beyond the state. Manifestly that view of congressional power would extend it into almost every field of human industry.</p>

<p id="fb8dd346-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stone</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb8dd347-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two principal questions raised by the record in this case are, first, whether Congress has constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate <span title="171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-171">p. 171</span>commerce of lumber manufactured by employees whose wages are less than a prescribed minimum or whose weekly hours of labor at that wage are greater than a prescribed maximum, and, second, whether it has power to prohibit the employment of workmen in the production of goods “for interstate commerce” at other than prescribed wages and hours.</p>
<p id="fb8dd348-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act. Its purpose is to exclude from interstate commerce goods produced for the commerce and to prevent their production for interstate commerce, under conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living necessary for health and general well-being; and to prevent the use of interstate commerce as the means of competition in the distribution of goods so produced, and as the means of spreading and perpetuating such substandard labor conditions among the workers of the several states.</p>
<p id="fb8dd349-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 15 of the statute prohibits certain specified acts and punishes willful violation of it by a fine of not more than $10,000 and punishes each conviction after the first by imprisonment of not more than six months or by the specified fine or both. Section 15(a)(1) makes unlawful the shipment in interstate commerce of any goods “in the production of which any employee was employed in violation of section 6(206) or section 7(207),” which provide, among other things, that during the first year of operation of the Act a minimum wage of 25 cents per hour shall be paid to employees “engaged in [interstate] commerce or in the production of goods for [interstate] commerce,” and that the maximum hours of employment for employees “engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce” without increased compensation for overtime, shall be forty-four hours a week.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The indictment charges that appellee is engaged, in the state of Georgia, in the business of acquiring raw materials, which he manufactures into finished lumber with the intent, when manufactured, to ship it in interstate commerce to customers outside the state, and that he does in fact so ship a large part of the lumber so produced.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While manufacture is not of itself interstate commerce the shipment of manufactured goods interstate is such commerce and the prohibition of such shipment by Congress is indubitably a regulation of the commerce. The power to regulate commerce is the power “to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.” The power of Congress over interstate commerce “is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed by the constitution.” Gibbons v. Ogden. Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from the commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the state has not sought to regulate their use.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such regulation is not a forbidden invasion of state power merely because either its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of commerce within the states of destination and is not prohibited unless by other Constitutional provisions. It is no objection to the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents <span title="172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-172">p. 172</span>which attend the exercise of the police power of the states. Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause. Subject only to that limitation, presently to be considered, we conclude that the prohibition of the shipment interstate of goods produced under the forbidden substandard labor conditions is within the constitutional authority of Congress.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the more than a century which has elapsed since the decision of Gibbons v. Ogden, these principles of constitutional interpretation have been so long and repeatedly recognized by this Court as applicable to the Commerce Clause, that there would be little occasion for repeating them now were it not for the decision of this Court twenty-two years ago in Hammer v. Dagenhart. Hammer v. Dagenhart has not been followed. The distinction on which the decision was rested that Congressional power to prohibit interstate commerce is limited to articles which in themselves have some harmful or deleterious property—a distinction which was novel when made and unsupported by any provision of the Constitution—has long since been abandoned.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v. Dagenhart, was a departure from the principles which have prevailed in the interpretation of the commerce clause both before and since the decision and that such vitality, as a precedent, as it then had has long since been exhausted. It should be and now is overruled.</p>
<p id="fb8dd34f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There remains the question whether such restriction on the production of goods for commerce is a permissible exercise of the commerce power. The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8dd350-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion is unaffected by the Tenth Amendment which provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.</p>

<p id="fb8dfa68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Jackson</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellee for many years past has owned and operated a small farm in Montgomery County, Ohio, maintaining a herd of dairy cattle, selling milk, raising poultry, and selling poultry and eggs. It has been his practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; to sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use some in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. The intended disposition of the crop here involved has not been expressly stated.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July of 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as then amended, there were established for the appellee’s 1941 crop a wheat acreage allotment of 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He was given notice of such allotment in July of 1940 before the Fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July of 1941, before it was harvested. He sowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under the terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty of 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the volume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the consequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce. Within prescribed limits and by prescribed standards the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop of wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into allotments for individual farms.</p>
<p id="fb8dfa6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I, §8, clause 3, Congress does not possess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise. The question would merit little consideration since our decision in United States v. Darby, sustaining the federal power to regulate production of goods for commerce except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm. Appellee says that this is a regulation of production and consumption of wheat. Such activities are, he urges, beyond the reach of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, since they are local in character, and their effects upon interstate commerce are at most “indirect.”</p>
<p id="fb8dfa6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that a review of the course of decision under the Commerce Clause will make plain, however, that questions of the power of Congress are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as “production” and “indirect” and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8e217e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once an economic measure of the reach of the power granted to Congress in the Commerce Clause is accepted, questions of federal power cannot be decided simply by finding the activity in question to be “production” nor can consideration of its economic effects be foreclosed by calling them “indirect.” Whether the subject of the regulation in question was “production,” “consumption,” or <span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-174">p. 174</span>“marketing” is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us. But even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as “direct” or “indirect.”</p>
<p id="fb8e217f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties have stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat industry. Commerce among the states in wheat is large and important. The effect of consumption of homegrown wheat on interstate commerce is due to the fact that it constitutes the most variable factor in the disappearance of the wheat crop. Consumption on the farm where grown appears to vary in an amount greater than 20 percent of average production. The total amount of wheat consumed as food varies but relatively little, and use as seed is relatively constant.</p>
<p id="fb8e2180-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The maintenance by government regulation of a price for wheat undoubtedly can be accomplished as effectively by sustaining or increasing the demand as by limiting the supply. The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the amount which may be produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs. That appellee’s own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.</p>
<p id="fb8e2181-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices. One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and if induced by rising prices tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon. This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown if wholly outside the scheme of regulation would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fb8e2182-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These three cases adopt broad definitions of “commerce” and “among the states” and reject the Tenth Amendment as a limit on Congress’s Commerce Clause power. Commerce includes all stages of business; no longer is a distinction drawn between commerce and other stages of business such as mining, manufacture, and production. Congress can regulate any activity, intrastate or interstate, that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Indeed, Congress can regulate activities that themselves have little effect on interstate commerce if the activity, looked at cumulatively throughout the country, has a substantial effect on commerce. The Tenth Amendment, as <i>Darby</i> states, is simply a reminder that for Congress to legislate it must point to express or implied <span title="175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-175">p. 175</span>power. The Tenth Amendment is no longer seen as reserving a zone of activities for exclusive state control.</p>
<p id="fb8e2183-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This expansive definition of Congress’s commerce power continued from 1937 until the 1990s. From 1937 until 1992, not one federal law was invalidated as exceeding the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause authority and only once was a federal law found to violate the Tenth Amendment, and that case was expressly overruled less than a decade later. In describing the law after <i>Jones &amp;</i> <i>Laughlin</i>, <i>Darby</i>, and <i>Wickard</i>, initially the cases concerning the meaning of “commerce among the states” are described, followed by an examination of cases concerning the Tenth Amendment during this time period.</p>

<p id="fb8e2186-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider three areas where the Court had the occasion to consider the meaning of “commerce among the states” after 1937: civil rights laws, regulatory laws, and criminal laws.</p>

<p id="fb8e2187-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Civil Rights Laws</i></b></p>
<p id="fb8e2188-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is among the most important federal laws enacted during the twentieth century. The law prohibits private employment discrimination based on race, gender, or religion, and forbids racial discrimination by places of public accommodation such as hotels and restaurants. Congress enacted this legislation under its Commerce Clause power.</p>
<p id="fb8e4899-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Logically, it might seem that the civil rights law would be most easily justified under Congress’s authority pursuant to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Supreme Court, in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), held that Congress, pursuant to §5, only could regulate government conduct and could not regulate private behavior under the Fourteenth Amendment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108DD_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N108DD_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span> Therefore in 1964, it was uncertain whether Congress could use its Fourteenth Amendment power to outlaw private discrimination in employment and public accommodations.

<p id="fb8e48a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a declaratory judgment action, attacking the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The case comes here on admissions and stipulated facts. Appellant owns and operates the Heart of Atlanta Motel which <span title="176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-176">p. 176</span>has 216 rooms available to transient guests. The motel is located on Courtland Street, two blocks from downtown Peachtree Street. It is readily accessible to interstate highways 75 and 85 and state highways 23 and 41. Appellant solicits patronage from outside the State of Georgia through various national advertising media, including magazines of national circulation; it maintains over 50 billboards and highway signs within the State, soliciting patronage for the motel; it accepts convention trade from outside Georgia and approximately 75% of its registered guests are from out of State. Prior to passage of the Act the motel had followed a practice of refusing to rent rooms to Negroes, and it alleged that it intended to continue to do so. In an effort to perpetuate that policy this suit was filed.</p>
<p id="fb8e48a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant contends that Congress in passing this Act exceeded its power to regulate commerce. The appellees counter that the unavailability to Negroes of adequate accommodations interferes significantly with interstate travel, and that Congress, under the Commerce Clause, has power to remove such obstructions and restraints.</p>
<p id="fb8e48a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole question posed is, therefore, the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as applied to these facts.</p>
<p id="fb8e48a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our study of the legislative record has brought us to the conclusion that Congress possessed ample power in this regard. While the Act as adopted carried no congressional findings the record of its passage through each house is replete with evidence of the burdens that discrimination by race or color places upon interstate commerce. This testimony included the fact that our people have become increasingly mobile with millions of people of all races traveling from State to State; that Negroes in particular have been the subject of discrimination in transient accommodations, having to travel great distances to secure the same; that often they have been unable to obtain accommodations and have had to call upon friends to put them up overnight, and that these conditions had become so acute as to require the listing of available lodging for Negroes in a special guidebook which was itself “dramatic testimony to the difficulties” Negroes encounter in travel. These exclusionary practices were found to be nationwide, the Under Secretary of Commerce testifying that there is “no question that this discrimination in the North still exists to a large degree” and in the West and Midwest as well. This testimony indicated a qualitative as well as quantitative effect on interstate travel by Negroes. The former was the obvious impairment of the Negro traveler’s pleasure and convenience that resulted when he continually was uncertain of finding lodging. As for the latter, there was evidence that this uncertainty stemming from racial discrimination had the effect of discouraging travel on the part of a substantial portion of the Negro community.</p>
<p id="fb8e48a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same interest in protecting interstate commerce which led Congress to deal with segregation in interstate carriers and the white-slave traffic has prompted it to extend the exercise of its power to gambling, <i>Lottery Case</i> (Champion v.

<p id="fb8e6fb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That Congress was legislating against moral wrongs in many of these areas rendered its enactments no less valid. In framing Title II of this Act Congress was also dealing with what it considered a moral problem. But that fact does not detract from the overwhelming evidence of the disruptive effect that racial discrimination has had on commercial intercourse. It was this burden which empowered Congress to enact appropriate legislation, and, given this basis for the exercise of its power, Congress was not restricted by the fact that the particular obstruction to interstate commerce with which it was dealing was also deemed a moral and social wrong.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that the operation of the motel here is of a purely local character. But, assuming this to be true, “[i]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.” Thus the power of Congress to promote interstate commerce also includes the power to regulate the local incidents thereof, including local activities in both the States of origin and destination, which might have a substantial and harmful effect upon that commerce. One need only examine the evidence which we have discussed above to see that Congress may—as it has—prohibit racial discrimination by motels serving travelers, however “local” their operations may appear.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, therefore, conclude that the action of the Congress in the adoption of the Act as applied here to a motel which concededly serves interstate travelers is within the power granted it by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court for 140 years. It may be argued that Congress could have pursued other methods to eliminate the obstructions it found in interstate commerce caused by racial discrimination. But this is a matter of policy that rests entirely with the Congress not with the courts. How obstructions in commerce may be removed—what means are to be employed—is within the sound and exclusive discretion of the Congress. It is subject only to one caveat—that the means chosen by it must be reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution. We cannot say that its choice here was not so adapted. The Constitution requires no more.</p>

<p id="fb8e6fbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though I join the Court’s opinions, I am somewhat reluctant here, to rest solely on the Commerce Clause. My reluctance is not due to any conviction that Congress lacks power to regulate commerce in the interests of human rights. It is rather my belief that the right of people to be free of state action that discriminates against them because of race, like the “right of persons to move freely from State to State,” “occupies a more protected position in our constitutional system than does the movement of cattle, fruit, steel and coal across state lines.” [T]he result reached by the Court is for me much more obvious as a protective measure under the Fourteenth Amendment than under the Commerce Clause. For the former deals with the constitutional status of the individual not with the impact on commerce of local activities or vice versa.</p>

A decision based on the Fourteenth Amendment would have a more settling effect, making unnecessary litigation over whether a particular restaurant or inn is within the commerce definitions of the Act or whether a particular customer is an interstate traveler. Under my construction, the Act would apply to all customers in all the enumerated places of public accommodation. And that construction would put an end to all obstructionist strategies and finally close one door on a bitter chapter in American history.</p>

<p id="fb8e6fc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ollie’s Barbecue is a family-owned restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, specializing in barbecued meats and homemade pies, with a seating capacity of 220 customers. It is located on a state highway 11 blocks from an interstate one and a somewhat greater distance from railroad and bus stations. The restaurant caters to a family and white-collar trade with a take-out service for Negroes. It employs 36 persons, two-thirds of whom are Negroes.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the 12 months preceding the passage of the Act, the restaurant purchased locally approximately $150,000 worth of food, $69,683 or 46% of which was meat that it bought from a local supplier who had procured it from outside the State. The District Court expressly found that a substantial portion of the food served in the restaurant had moved in interstate commerce. The restaurant has refused to serve Negroes in its dining accommodations since its original opening in 1927, and since July 2, 1964, it has been operating in violation of the Act. The court below concluded that if it were required to serve Negroes it would lose a substantial amount of business.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic holding in <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel</i>, answers many of the contentions made by the appellees. There we outlined the overall purpose and operations plan of Title II and found it a valid exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce insofar as it requires hotels and motels to serve transients without regard to their race or color. In this case we consider its application to restaurants which serve food a substantial portion of which has moved in commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ollie’s Barbecue admits that it is covered by the Act. The Government makes no contention that the discrimination at the restaurant was supported by the State of Alabama. There is no claim that interstate travelers frequented the restaurant. The sole question, therefore, narrows down to whether Title II, as applied to a restaurant annually receiving about $70,000 worth of food which has moved in commerce, is a valid exercise of the power of Congress.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that [the extensive] testimony [before Congress about the effects of discrimination by restaurants] afforded ample basis for the conclusion that established restaurants in such areas sold less interstate goods because of the discrimination, that interstate travel was obstructed directly by it, that business in general suffered and that many new businesses refrained from establishing there as a result of it. Hence the District Court was in error in concluding that there was no connection between discrimination and the movement of interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8e6fc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>It goes without saying that, viewed in isolation, the volume of food purchased by Ollie’s Barbecue from sources supplied from out of state was insignificant when compared with the total foodstuffs moving in commerce. But, as our late Brother Jackson said for the Court in Wickard v. Filburn: “That appellee’s own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.”</p>
<p id="fb8e96d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much is said about a restaurant business being local but “even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce. . . .” Wickard v. Filburn. The activities that are beyond the reach of Congress are “those which are completely within a particular State, which do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the government.” Gibbons v. Ogden. This rule is as good today as it was when Chief Justice Marshall laid it down almost a century and a half ago.</p>
<p id="fb8e96da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has held time and again that this power extends to activities of retail establishments, including restaurants, which directly or indirectly burden or obstruct interstate commerce. Here, Congress has determined for itself that refusals of service to Negroes have imposed burdens both upon the interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products generally. Of course, the mere fact that Congress has said when particular activity shall be deemed to affect commerce does not preclude further examination by this Court. But where we find that the legislators, in light of the facts and testimony before them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end. The only remaining question—one answered in the affirmative by the court below—is whether the particular restaurant either serves or offers to serve interstate travelers or serves food a substantial portion of which has moved in interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8e96db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Confronted as we are with the facts laid before Congress, we must conclude that it had a rational basis for finding that racial discrimination in restaurants had a direct and adverse effect on the free flow of interstate commerce. The power of Congress in this field is broad and sweeping; where it keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, as here applied, we find to be plainly appropriate in the resolution of what the Congress found to be a national commercial problem of the first magnitude. We find it in no violation of any express limitations of the Constitution and we therefore declare it valid.</p>

<p id="fb8e96df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court found that this law was within the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause authority and described this power in expansive terms.

<p id="fb8e96e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is worth noting that not all of the Justices agreed with this broad definition of the commerce power. Justice Rehnquist, in a companion case, wrote: “It would be a mistake to conclude that Congress’s power to regulate . . . is unlimited. Some activities may be so private or local in nature that they may not be in commerce. . . . [The] Court asserts that regulation will be upheld if Congress had a rational basis for finding that the regulated activity affects interstate commerce. . . .

<p id="fb8e96e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">PEREZ v. UNITED STATES, 402 U.S. 146 (1971): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> wrote the opinion for the Court.</p>
<p id="fb8e96e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in this case is whether Title II of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, is a permissible exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Petitioner is one of the species commonly known as “loan sharks” which Congress found are in large part under the control of “organized crime.” “Extortionate credit transactions” are defined as those characterized by the use or threat of the use of “violence or other criminal means” in enforcement. There was ample evidence showing petitioner was a “loan shark” who used the threat of violence as a method of collection.</p>
<p id="fb8e96e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional question is a substantial one. The Commerce Clause reaches, in the main, three categories of problems. First, the use of channels of interstate or foreign commerce which Congress deems are being misused, as, for example, the shipment of stolen goods or of persons who have been kidnapped. Second, protection of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as for example, the destruction of an aircraft, or persons or things in commerce, as, for example, thefts from interstate shipments. Third, those activities affecting commerce. It is with this last category that we are here concerned.</p>
<p id="fb8e96e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Extortionate credit transactions, though purely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affect interstate commerce. The findings by Congress are quite adequate on that ground. The McDade Amendment in the House, was the one ultimately adopted. As stated by Congressman McDade it grew out of a “profound study of organized crime, its ramifications and its implications.” The results of that study were included in a report, The Urban Poor and Organized Crime, submitted to the House on August 29, 1967, which revealed that “organized crime takes over $350 million a year from America’s poor through loan-sharking alone.” Congressman McDade also relied on The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, A Report by the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (February 1967) which stated that loan sharking was “the second largest source of revenue for organized crime,” and is one way by which the underworld obtains control of legitimate businesses.</p>
<p id="fb8e96e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essence of all these reports and hearings was summarized and embodied in formal congressional findings. They supplied Congress with the knowledge <span title="181" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-181">p. 181</span>that the loan shark racket provides organized crime with its second most lucrative source of revenue, exacts millions from the pockets of people, coerces its victims into the commission of crimes against property, and causes the takeover by racketeers of legitimate businesses.</p>
<p id="fb8e96e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have mentioned in detail the economic, financial, and social setting of the problem as revealed to Congress. We do so not to infer that Congress need make particularized findings in order to legislate. We relate the history of the Act in detail to answer the impassioned plea of petitioner that all that is involved in loan sharking is a traditionally local activity. It appears, instead, that loan sharking in its national setting is one way organized interstate crime holds its guns to the heads of the poor and the rich alike and syphons funds from numerous localities to finance its national operations.</p>
<p id="fb8e96ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb8e96eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress surely has power under the Commerce Clause to enact criminal laws to protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to prohibit the misuse of the channels or facilities of interstate commerce, and to prohibit or regulate those intrastate activities that have a demonstrably substantial effect on interstate commerce. But under the statute before us a man can be convicted without any proof of interstate movement, of the use of the facilities of interstate commerce, or of facts showing that his conduct affected interstate commerce. I think the framers of the Constitution never intended that the National Government might define as a crime and prosecute such wholly local activity through the enactment of federal criminal laws.</p>
<p id="fb8e96ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to sustain this law we would, in my view, have to be able at the least to say that Congress could rationally have concluded that loan sharking is an activity with interstate attributes that distinguish it in some substantial respect from other local crime. But it is not enough to say that loan sharking is a national problem, for all crime is a national problem. It is not enough to say that some loan sharking has interstate characteristics, for any crime may have an interstate setting. And the circumstance that loan sharking has an adverse impact on interstate business is not a distinguishing attribute, for interstate business suffers from almost all criminal activity, be it shoplifting or violence in the streets.</p>
<p id="fb8ebdfd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I am unable to discern any rational distinction between loan sharking and other local crime, I cannot escape the conclusion that this statute was beyond the power of Congress to enact. The definition and prosecution of local, intrastate crime are reserved to the States under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.</p>

<p id="fb8ebe00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In United States v. Darby, above, the Court declared that the Tenth Amendment is “but a truism,” simply a reminder that for Congress to act it must have authority under the Constitution. This approach to the Tenth Amendment was followed without exception until 1976, when the Court invalidated a federal law for violating the Tenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb8ebe01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In National League of Cities v.

The Court began with the premise that “there are limits upon the power of Congress to override state sovereignty, even when exercising its otherwise plenary powers to tax or to regulate commerce.” The Court found that requiring states to pay their employees the minimum wage violated the Tenth Amendment because the law “operate[s] to directly displace the States’ freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.”</p>
<p id="fb8ebe02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court explained that forcing state and local governments to pay their employees the minimum wage would require that they either raise taxes or cut other services to pay these costs. The Court said that this would displace decisions traditionally left to the states and “may substantially restructure traditional ways in which the local governments have arranged their affairs.” In other words, National League of Cities v. Usery held that Congress violates the Tenth Amendment when it interferes with traditional state and local government functions. The Court, however, did not attempt to define what is such a traditional function; the Court only held that forcing payment of the minimum wage was unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fb8ebe03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Harry Blackmun wrote a concurring opinion that said that he saw the majority as adopting “a balancing approach [that] . . . does not outlaw federal power in areas such as environmental protection, where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state facility compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential.”</p>
<p id="fb8ebe04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice William Brennan wrote for the four dissenters and lamented the Court’s use of the Tenth Amendment as a limit on congressional power: “My Brethren thus have today manufactured an abstraction without substance, founded neither in the words of the Constitution nor on precedent. . . . Today’s repudiation of this unbroken line of precedents that firmly reject my Brethren’s ill-conceived abstraction can only be regarded as a transparent cover for invalidating a congressional judgment with which they disagree. The only analysis even remotely resembling that adopted today is found in a line of opinions dealing with the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment that ultimately provoked a constitutional crisis for the Court in the 1930s.”</p>
<p id="fb8ebe05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the decade after <i>National League of Cities</i>, the Supreme Court rejected Tenth Amendment challenges to several other federal laws and continually narrowed the Tenth Amendment protection provided in that decision.

<p id="fb8ebe06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association, 452 U.S. 264 (1981), the Court made it clear that <i>Usery</i> only applied when Congress was regulating state governments, not when Congress was regulating private conduct. In <i>Hodel</i>, the Court upheld a federal law that regulated strip mining and required reclamation of strip-mined land. The Court clarified its test for the Tenth Amendment in light of <i>Usery</i>. The Court said that for a federal law to violate the Tenth Amendment, it needed to regulate “the States as States”; it must “address matters that are indisputably attribute[s] of state sovereignty”; it must directly impair the States’ ability to “structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions”; and it must not be such that “the nature of the federal interest . . . justifies state submission.” The Court in <i>Hodel</i> found that the law, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, <span title="183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-183">p. 183</span>was constitutional because it did not regulate the states as states.

<p id="fb8ee51e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb8ee51f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We revisit in these cases an issue raised in National League of Cities v. Usery. In that litigation, this Court, by a sharply divided vote, ruled that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce the minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) against the States “in areas of traditional governmental functions.” Although <i>National League of Cities</i> supplied some examples of “traditional governmental functions,” it did not offer a general explanation of how a “traditional” function is to be distinguished from a “nontraditional” one. Since then, federal and state courts have struggled with the task, thus imposed, of identifying a traditional function for purposes of state immunity under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8ee520-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our examination of this “function” standard applied in these and other cases over the last eight years now persuades us that the attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of “traditional governmental function” is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which <i>National League of Cities</i> purported to rest. That case, accordingly, is overruled.</p>
<p id="fb8ee521-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under <i>National League of Cities.</i> Many constitutional standards involve “undoubte[d] . . . gray areas,” and, despite the difficulties that this Court and other courts have encountered so far, it normally might be fair to venture the assumption that case-by-case development would lead to a workable standard for determining whether a particular governmental function should be immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8ee522-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe, however, that there is a more fundamental problem at work here, a problem that explains why an attempt to draw distinctions with respect to federal regulatory authority under <i>National League of Cities</i> is unlikely to succeed regardless of how the distinctions are phrased. The problem is that neither the governmental/proprietary distinction nor any other that purports to separate out important governmental functions can be faithful to the role of federalism in a democratic society. The essence of our federal system is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal, no matter how unorthodox or unnecessary anyone else—including the judiciary—deems state involvement to be. Any rule of state immunity that looks <span title="184" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-184">p. 184</span>to the “traditional,” “integral,” or “necessary” nature of governmental functions inevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies it favors and which ones it dislikes.</p>
<p id="fb8ee523-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore now reject, as unsound in principle and unworkable in practice, a rule of state immunity from federal regulation that turns on a judicial appraisal of whether a particular governmental function is “integral” or “traditional.” Any such rule leads to inconsistent results at the same time that it disserves principles of democratic self-governance, and it breeds inconsistency precisely because it is divorced from those principles. If there are to be limits on the Federal Government’s power to interfere with state functions—as undoubtedly there are—we must look elsewhere to find them.</p>
<p id="fb8ee524-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central theme of <i>National League of Cities</i> was that the States occupy a special position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position. Of course, the Commerce Clause by its specific language does not provide any special limitation on Congress’s actions with respect to the States.</p>
<p id="fb8ee525-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations. We doubt that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty. In part, this is because of the elusiveness of objective criteria for “fundamental” elements of state sovereignty, a problem we have witnessed in the search for “traditional governmental functions.”</p>
<p id="fb8ee526-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from the limitation on federal authority inherent in the delegated nature of Congress’s Article I powers, the principal means chosen by the framers to ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the structure of the Federal Government itself.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A9F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A9F_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span> It is no novelty to observe that the composition of the Federal Government was designed in large part to protect the States from overreaching by Congress. The framers thus gave the States a role in the selection both of the Executive and the Legislative Branches of the Federal Government. The States were vested with indirect influence over the House of Representatives and the Presidency by their control of electoral qualifications and their role in Presidential elections. U.S. Const., Art. I, §2, and Art. II, §1. They were given more direct influence in the Senate, where each State received equal representation and each Senator was to be selected by the legislature of his State. Art. I, §3. The significance attached to the States’ equal representation in the Senate is underscored by the prohibition of any constitutional amendment divesting a State of equal representation without the State’s consent. Art. V.</p>
<p id="fb8ee528-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extent to which the structure of the Federal Government itself was relied on to insulate the interests of the States is evident in the views of the framers. James Madison explained that the Federal Government “will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States], to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments.” The Federalist No. 46.</p>
<p id="fb8ee529-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-185">p. 185</span>The effectiveness of the federal political process in preserving the States’ interests is apparent even today in the course of federal legislation. On the one hand, the States have been able to direct a substantial proportion of federal revenues into their own treasuries in the form of general and program-specific grants in aid. The federal role in assisting state and local governments is a longstanding one; Congress provided federal land grants to finance state governments from the beginning of the Republic, and direct cash grants were awarded as early as 1887 under the Hatch Act. In the past quarter-century alone, federal grants to States and localities have grown from $7 billion to $96 billion. As a result, federal grants now account for about one-fifth of state and local government expenditures. The States have obtained federal funding for such services as police and fire protection, education, public health and hospitals, parks and recreation, and sanitation. Moreover, at the same time that the States have exercised their influence to obtain federal support, they have been able to exempt themselves from a wide variety of obligations imposed by Congress under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8ee52a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We realize that changes in the structure of the Federal Government have taken place since 1789, not the least of which has been the substitution of popular election of Senators by the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, and that these changes may work to alter the influence of the States in the federal political process. Nonetheless, against this background, we are convinced that the fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the “States as States” is one of process rather than one of result. Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a “sacred province of state autonomy.”</p>
<p id="fb8ee52b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insofar as the present cases are concerned, then, we need go no further than to state that we perceive nothing in the overtime and minimum-wage requirements of the FLSA, as applied to SAMTA, that is destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision. SAMTA faces nothing more than the same minimum-wage and overtime obligations that hundreds of thousands of other employers, public as well as private, have to meet.</p>
<p id="fb8f0b3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, we continue to recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position. But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action—the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action. The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated. In the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.</p>

<p id="fb8f0b40-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="186" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-186">p. 186</span>There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled. There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness. The reasoning of the Court in <i>National League of Cities</i>, and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.</p>
<p id="fb8f0b41-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever effect the Court’s decision may have in weakening the application of stare decisis, it is likely to be less important than what the Court has done to the Constitution itself. A unique feature of the United States is the federal system of government guaranteed by the Constitution and implicit in the very name of our country. Despite some genuflecting in the Court’s opinion to the concept of federalism, today’s decision effectively reduces the Tenth Amendment to meaningless rhetoric when Congress acts pursuant to the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8f3252-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To leave no doubt about its intention, the Court renounces its decision in <i>National League of Cities</i> because it “inevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies it favors and which ones it dislikes.” In other words, the extent to which the States may exercise their authority, when Congress purports to act under the Commerce Clause, henceforth is to be determined from time to time by political decisions made by members of the Federal Government, decisions the Court says will not be subject to judicial review. I note that it does not seem to have occurred to the Court that it—an unelected majority of five Justices—today rejects almost 200 years of the understanding of the constitutional status of federalism. In doing so, there is only a single passing reference to the Tenth Amendment. Nor is so much as a dictum of any court cited in support of the view that the role of the States in the federal system may depend upon the grace of elected federal officials, rather than on the Constitution as interpreted by this Court.</p>
<p id="fb8f3253-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s opinion does not explain how the States’ role in the electoral process guarantees that particular exercises of the Commerce Clause power will not infringe on residual state sovereignty. Members of Congress are elected from the various States, but once in office they are Members of the Federal Government. Although the States participate in the Electoral College, this is hardly a reason to view the President as a representative of the States’ interest against federal encroachment. We noted recently “[t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its power. . . .” INS v. Chadha (1983). The Court offers no reason to think that this pressure will not operate when Congress seeks to invoke its powers under the Commerce Clause, notwithstanding the electoral role of the States.</p>
<p id="fb8f3254-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court apparently thinks that the State’s success at obtaining federal funds for various projects and exemptions from the obligations of some federal statutes is indicative of the “effectiveness of the federal political process in preserving the States’ interests. . . .” But such political success is not relevant to the question whether the political processes are the proper means of enforcing constitutional limitations. The fact that Congress generally does not transgress constitutional limits on its power to reach state activities does not make judicial review any less necessary to rectify the cases in which it does do so. The States’ role in our system of government is a matter of constitutional law, not of legislative grace. “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution<span title="187" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-187">p. 187</span>, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.” U.S. Const., Amdt. 10.</p>
<p id="fb8f3255-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More troubling than the logical infirmities in the Court’s reasoning is the result of its holding, i.e., that federal political officials, invoking the Commerce Clause, are the sole judges of the limits of their own power. This result is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of our constitutional system. See, e.g., The Federalist No. 78 (Hamilton). At least since Marbury v. Madison (1803), it has been the settled province of the federal judiciary “to say what the law is” with respect to the constitutionality of Acts of Congress. In rejecting the role of the judiciary in protecting the States from federal overreaching, the Court’s opinion offers no explanation for ignoring the teaching of the most famous case in our history.</p>
<p id="fb8f3256-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States. Although it says that the States “unquestionably do ‘retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority,’” it fails to recognize the broad, yet specific areas of sovereignty that the framers intended the States to retain. Indeed, the Court barely acknowledges that the Tenth Amendment exists. Indeed, the Court’s view of federalism appears to relegate the States to precisely the trivial role that opponents of the Constitution feared they would occupy.</p>

<p id="fb8f325b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the 1990s, the Supreme Court once more changed course with regard to the scope of Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause and whether the Tenth Amendment is a limit on federal power. In 1995, in United States v. Lopez, the Supreme Court for the first time in almost 60 years found that a federal law exceeded Congress’s Commerce Clause authority. <i>Lopez</i> led to challenges to literally dozens of federal laws. In 2000, the Court reaffirmed <i>Lopez</i> in United States v. Morrison. Additionally, in 1992, in New York v. United States and in 1997, in Printz v. United States, the Court again used the Tenth Amendment to protect state governments from federal encroachments. All of these cases are presented below. Additionally, of course, both the commerce power and the Tenth Amendment are discussed in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which is presented above.</p>
<p id="fb8f325c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reading these recent decisions concerning the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment, it will be helpful to focus on two questions, one descriptive and one normative.

<p id="fb8f5975-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress made it a federal offense “for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.” 18 U.S.C. §922(q)(1)(A). The Act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce. We hold that the Act exceeds the authority of Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States. . . .”</p>
<p id="fb8f5976-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 10, 1992, respondent, who was then a 12th-grade student, arrived at Edison High School in San Antonio, Texas, carrying a concealed .38-caliber handgun and five bullets. Acting upon an anonymous tip, school authorities confronted respondent, who admitted that he was carrying the weapon. He was arrested and charged under Texas law with firearm possession on school premises. The next day, the state charges were dismissed after federal agents charged respondent by complaint with violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. The term “school zone” is defined as “in, or on the grounds of, a public, parochial or private school” or “within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school.”</p>
<p id="fb8f5977-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent waived his right to a jury trial. The District Court conducted a bench trial, found him guilty, and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment and two years’ supervised release.</p>
<p id="fb8f5978-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start with first principles. The Constitution creates a Federal Government of enumerated powers. As James Madison wrote: “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist No. 45. This constitutionally mandated division of authority “was adopted by the framers to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties.” “Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.”</p>
<p id="fb8f5979-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court then reviewed the history of Commerce Clause decisions from Gibbons v. Ogden through the early 1940s.] <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel</i>, <i>Darby</i>, and <i>Wickard</i> ushered in an era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that greatly expanded the previously defined authority of Congress under that Clause. In part, this was a recognition of the great changes that had occurred in the way business was carried on in this country. Enterprises that had once been local or at most regional in nature had become national in scope. But the doctrinal change also reflected a view that earlier Commerce Clause cases artificially had constrained the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. But even these modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits.</p>
<p id="fb8f597a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="189" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-189">p. 189</span>Consistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. See, e.g., <i>Darby; Heart of Atlanta Motel.</i> Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. See, e.g., <i>Shreveport Rate Cases</i> (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States (1911) (upholding amendments to Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in intrastate commerce). Finally, Congress’s commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, <i>Jones</i> &amp; <i>Laughlin Steel</i>, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f597b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within this final category, admittedly, our case law has not been clear whether an activity must “affect” or “substantially affect” interstate commerce in order to be within Congress’s power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause. We conclude, consistent with the great weight of our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of whether the regulated activity “substantially affects” interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f597c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in the light of this framework, to enact §922(q). The first two categories of authority may be quickly disposed of: §922(q) is not a regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce; nor can §922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstate commerce or a thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if §922(q) is to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f597d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce. Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with “commerce” or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f808e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, §922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce. For example, in United States v. Bass (1971), the Court interpreted former 18 U.S.C. §1202(a), which made it a crime for a felon to “receiv[e], posses[s], or transpor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm.” The Court interpreted the possession component of §1202(a) to require an additional nexus to interstate commerce both because the statute was ambiguous and because “unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.” Unlike the statute in <i>Bass</i>, §922(q) has no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f808f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although as part of our independent evaluation of constitutionality under the Commerce Clause we of course consider legislative findings, and indeed <span title="190" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-190">p. 190</span>even congressional committee findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce, the Government concedes that “[n]either the statute nor its legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.” We agree with the Government that Congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce. But to the extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they are lacking here.</p>
<p id="fb8f8090-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s essential contention, is that we may determine here that §922(q) is valid because possession of a firearm in a local school zone does indeed substantially affect interstate commerce. The Government argues that possession of a firearm in a school zone may result in violent crime and that violent crime can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be unsafe. The Government also argues that the presence of guns in schools poses a substantial threat to the educational process by threatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive citizenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the Nation’s economic well-being. As a result, the Government argues that Congress could rationally have concluded that §922(q) substantially affects interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f8091-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We pause to consider the implications of the Government’s arguments. The Government admits, under its “costs of crime” reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce. Similarly, under the Government’s “national productivity” reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the theories that the Government presents in support of §922(q), it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government’s arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.</p>
<p id="fb8f8092-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Justice Breyer argues that acceptance of the Government’s rationales would not authorize a general federal police power, he is unable to identify any activity that the States may regulate but Congress may not. Justice Breyer posits that there might be some limitations on Congress’s commerce power, such as family law or certain aspects of education. These suggested limitations, when viewed in light of the dissent’s expansive analysis, are devoid of substance.</p>
<p id="fb8f8093-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its Commerce Clause power, regulate activities that adversely affect the learning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulate the educational process directly. Congress could determine that a school’s curriculum has a “significant” effect on the extent of classroom learning. As a result, Congress could mandate a federal curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has <span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>a significant “effect on classroom learning,” and that, in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f8094-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress’s authority is limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender “legal uncertainty.” The Constitution mandates this uncertainty by withholding from Congress a plenary police power that would authorize enactment of every type of legislation.</p>
<p id="fb8f8095-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are not precise formulations, and in the nature of things they cannot be. But we think they point the way to a correct decision of this case. The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce. Respondent was a local student at a local school; there is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there is no requirement that his possession of the firearm have any concrete tie to interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8f8096-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To uphold the Government’s contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States. Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long steps down that road, giving great deference to congressional action. The broad language in these opinions has suggested the possibility of additional expansion, but we decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require us to conclude that the Constitution’s enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not enumerated, and that there never will be a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local. This we are unwilling to do.</p>

<p id="fb8f8098-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of the judicial struggle to interpret the Commerce Clause during the transition from the economic system the Founders knew to the single, national market still emergent in our own era counsels great restraint before the Court determines that the Clause is insufficient to support an exercise of the national power. That history gives me some pause about today’s decision, but I join the Court’s opinion with these observations on what I conceive to be its necessary though limited holding.</p>
<p id="fb8f8099-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of our Commerce Clause decisions contains at least two lessons of relevance to this case. The first, as stated at the outset, is the imprecision of content-based boundaries used without more to define the limits of the Commerce Clause. The second, related to the first but of even greater consequence, is that the Court as an institution and the legal system as a whole have an immense stake in the stability of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as it has evolved to this point. Stare decisis operates with great force in counseling us not to call in question the essential principles now in place respecting the congressional power to regulate transactions of a commercial nature. That fundamental restraint on our power forecloses us from reverting to an understanding of commerce that would serve only an 18th-century economy, dependent then upon production and trading practices that had changed but little over the preceding centuries; it also mandates against returning to the time when congressional authority to <span title="192" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-192">p. 192</span>regulate undoubted commercial activities was limited by a judicial determination that those matters had an insufficient connection to an interstate system. Congress can regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national economy.</p>
<p id="fb8f809a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be mistaken and mischievous for the political branches to forget that the sworn obligation to preserve and protect the Constitution in maintaining the federal balance is their own in the first and primary instance. At the same time, the absence of structural mechanisms to require those officials to undertake this principled task, and the momentary political convenience often attendant upon their failure to do so, argue against a complete renunciation of the judicial role. Although it is the obligation of all officers of the Government to respect the constitutional design, the federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene when one or the other level of Government has tipped the scales too far.</p>
<p id="fb8f809b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute before us upsets the federal balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is required. As the Chief Justice explains, unlike the earlier cases to come before the Court here neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercial character, and neither the purposes nor the design of the statute has an evident commercial nexus. The statute makes the simple possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the school a criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial origin or consequence, but we have not yet said the commerce power may reach so far. If Congress attempts that extension, then at the least we must inquire whether the exercise of national power seeks to intrude upon an area of traditional state concern.</p>
<p id="fb8f809c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An interference of these dimensions occurs here, for it is well established that education is a traditional concern of the States. Milliken v. Bradley (1974); Epperson v. Arkansas (1968). The proximity to schools, including of course schools owned and operated by the States or their subdivisions, is the very premise for making the conduct criminal. In these circumstances, we have a particular duty to ensure that the federal-state balance is not destroyed.</p>
<p id="fb8f809d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is doubtful that any State, or indeed any reasonable person, would argue that it is wise policy to allow students to carry guns on school premises, considerable disagreement exists about how best to accomplish that goal. In this circumstance, the theory and utility of our federalism are revealed, for the States may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best solution is far from clear.</p>
<p id="fb8f809e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a State or municipality determines that harsh criminal sanctions are necessary and wise to deter students from carrying guns on school premises, the reserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those measures. Indeed, over 40 States already have criminal laws outlawing the possession of firearms on or near school grounds.</p>
<p id="fb8f809f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other, more practicable means to rid the schools of guns may be thought by the citizens of some States to be preferable for the safety and welfare of the schools those States are charged with maintaining. These might include inducements to inform on violators where the information leads to arrests or confiscation of the guns; programs to encourage the voluntary surrender of guns with some provision for amnesty; penalties imposed on parents or guardians <span title="193" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-193">p. 193</span>for failure to supervise the child; laws providing for suspension or expulsion of gun-toting students.</p>
<p id="fb8f80a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area to which States lay claim by right of history and expertise, and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term. The tendency of this statute to displace state regulation in areas of traditional state concern is evident from its territorial operation. There are over 100,000 elementary and secondary schools in the United States. Each of these now has an invisible federal zone extending 1,000 feet beyond the (often irregular) boundaries of the school property. Yet throughout these areas, school officials would find their own programs for the prohibition of guns in danger of displacement by the federal authority unless the State chooses to enact a parallel rule.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent a stronger connection or identification with commercial concerns that are central to the Commerce Clause, that interference contradicts the federal balance the framers designed and that this Court is obliged to enforce.</p>

<p id="fb8fa7b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today properly concludes that the Commerce Clause does not grant Congress the authority to prohibit gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school, as it attempted to do in the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. Although I join the majority, I write separately to observe that our case law has drifted far from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause. In a future case, we ought to temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence in a manner that both makes sense of our more recent case law and is more faithful to the original understanding of that Clause.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the principal dissent concedes that there are limits to federal power, the sweeping nature of our current test enables the dissent to argue that Congress can regulate gun possession. But it seems to me that the power to regulate “commerce” can by no means encompass authority over mere gun possession, any more than it empowers the Federal Government to regulate marriage, littering, or cruelty to animals, throughout the 50 States. Our Constitution quite properly leaves such matters to the individual States, notwithstanding these activities’ effects on interstate commerce. Any interpretation of the Commerce Clause that even suggests that Congress could regulate such matters is in need of reexamination.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an appropriate case, I believe that we must further reconsider our “substantial effects” test with an eye toward constructing a standard that reflects the text and history of the Commerce Clause without totally rejecting our more recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, however, I merely support the Court’s conclusion with a discussion of the text, structure, and history of the Commerce Clause and an analysis of our early case law. My goal is simply to show how far we have departed from the original understanding and to demonstrate that the result we reach today is by no means “radical.” I also want to point out the necessity of refashioning a coherent test that does not tend to “obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government.”</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time the original Constitution was ratified, “commerce” consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes. See 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 361 (4th ed. 1773) <span title="194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-194">p. 194</span>(defining commerce as “Intercour[s]e; exchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing; trade; traffick”); N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed. 1789) (“trade or traffic”); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1796) (“Exchange of one thing for another; trade, traffick”). As one would expect, the term “commerce” was used in contradistinction to productive activities such as manufacturing and agriculture.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, interjecting a modern sense of commerce into the Constitution generates significant textual and structural problems. For example, one cannot replace “commerce” with a different type of enterprise, such as manufacturing. When a manufacturer produces a car, assembly cannot take place “with a foreign nation” or “with the Indian Tribes.” Parts may come from different States or other nations and hence may have been in the flow of commerce at one time, but manufacturing takes place at a discrete site. Agriculture and manufacturing involve the production of goods; commerce encompasses traffic in such articles.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution not only uses the word “commerce” in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause does not state that Congress may “regulate matters that substantially affect commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”</p>
<p id="fb8fa7ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Put simply, much if not all of Art. I, §8 (including portions of the Commerce Clause itself), would be surplusage if Congress had been given authority over matters that substantially affect interstate commerce. An interpretation of cl. 3 that makes the rest of §8 superfluous simply cannot be correct. Yet this Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence has endorsed just such an interpretation: The power we have accorded Congress has swallowed Art. I, §8.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, if a “substantial effects” test can be appended to the Commerce Clause, why not to every other power of the Federal Government? There is no reason for singling out the Commerce Clause for special treatment. Accordingly, Congress could regulate all matters that “substantially affect” the Army and Navy, bankruptcies, tax collection, expenditures, and so on. In that case, the Clauses of §8 all mutually overlap, something we can assume the Founding Fathers never intended.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am aware of no cases prior to the New Deal that characterized the power flowing from the Commerce Clause as sweepingly as does our substantial effects test. My review of the case law indicates that the substantial effects test is but an innovation of the 20th century.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As recently as 1936, the Court continued to insist that the Commerce Clause did not reach the wholly internal business of the States. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co. (1936); see also A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935). The Federal Government simply could not reach such subjects regardless of their effects on interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8fa7be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases all establish a simple point: From the time of the ratification of the Constitution to the mid-1930’s, it was widely understood that the Constitution granted Congress only limited powers, notwithstanding the Commerce Clause. Moreover, there was no question that activities wholly separated from business, such as gun possession, were beyond the reach of the commerce power. If anything, the “wrong turn” was the Court’s dramatic departure in the 1930’s from a century and a half of precedent.</p>
<p id="fb8fcecf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="195" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-195">p. 195</span>Apart from its recent vintage and its corresponding lack of any grounding in the original understanding of the Constitution, the substantial effects test suffers from the further flaw that it appears to grant Congress a police power over the Nation. The substantial effects test suffers from this flaw, in part, because of its “aggregation principle.” Under so-called “class of activities” statutes, Congress can regulate whole categories of activities that are not themselves either “interstate” or “commerce.” In applying the effects test, we ask whether the class of activities as a whole substantially affects interstate commerce, not whether any specific activity within the class has such effects when considered in isolation.</p>
<p id="fb8fced0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The aggregation principle is clever, but has no stopping point. Suppose all would agree that gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school does not substantially affect commerce, but that possession of weapons generally (knives, brass knuckles, nunchakus, etc.) does. Under our substantial effects doctrine, even though Congress cannot single out gun possession, it can prohibit weapon possession generally. But one always can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce. Under our jurisprudence, if Congress passed an omnibus “substantially affects interstate commerce” statute, purporting to regulate every aspect of human existence, the Act apparently would be constitutional. Even though particular sections may govern only trivial activities, the statute in the aggregate regulates matters that substantially affect commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8fced1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unless the dissenting Justices are willing to repudiate our long-held understanding of the limited nature of federal power, I would think that they, too, must be willing to reconsider the substantial effects test in a future case. If we wish to be true to a Constitution that does not cede a police power to the Federal Government, our Commerce Clause’s boundaries simply cannot be “defined” as being “commensurate with the national needs” or self-consciously intended to let the Federal Government “defend itself against economic forces that Congress decrees inimical or destructive of the national economy.” Such a formulation of federal power is no test at all: It is a blank check.</p>
<p id="fb8fced2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At an appropriate juncture, I think we must modify our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Today, it is easy enough to say that the Clause certainly does not empower Congress to ban gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school.</p>

I, §8, cl. 3, is vitally dependent on the character of the education of our children. I therefore agree entirely with Justice Breyer’s explanation of why Congress has ample power to prohibit the possession of firearms in or near schools—just as it may protect the school environment from harms posed by controlled substances such as asbestos or alcohol. I also agree with Justice Souter’s exposition of the radical character of the Court’s holding and its kinship with the discredited, pre-Depression version of substantive due process.</p>
<p id="fb8fced5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Guns are both articles of commerce and articles that can be used to restrain commerce. Their possession is the consequence, either directly or indirectly, of commercial activity. In my judgment, Congress’s power to regulate commerce in firearms includes the power to prohibit possession of guns at any location <span title="196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-196">p. 196</span>because of their potentially harmful use; it necessarily follows that Congress may also prohibit their possession in particular markets. The market for the possession of handguns by school-age children is, distressingly, substantial. Whether or not the national interest in eliminating that market would have justified federal legislation in 1789, it surely does today.</p>

<p id="fb8fced7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reviewing congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause, we defer to what is often a merely implicit congressional judgment that its regulation addresses a subject substantially affecting interstate commerce “if there is any rational basis for such a finding.” Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc. (1981). If that congressional determination is within the realm of reason, “the only remaining question for judicial inquiry is whether ‘the means chosen by Congress [are] reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.’”</p>
<p id="fb8fced8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practice of deferring to rationally based legislative judgments “is a paradigm of judicial restraint.” In judicial review under the Commerce Clause, it reflects our respect for the institutional competence of the Congress on a subject expressly assigned to it by the Constitution and our appreciation of the legitimacy that comes from Congress’s political accountability in dealing with matters open to a wide range of possible choices.</p>
<p id="fb8fced9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was not ever thus, however, as even a brief overview of Commerce Clause history during the past century reminds us. The modern respect for the competence and primacy of Congress in matters affecting commerce developed only after one of this Court’s most chastening experiences, when it perforce repudiated an earlier and untenably expansive conception of judicial review in derogation of congressional commerce power. A look at history’s sequence will serve to show how today’s decision tugs the Court off course, leading it to suggest opportunities for further developments that would be at odds with the rule of restraint to which the Court still wisely states adherence.</p>
<p id="fb8fceda-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is today, however, a backward glance at both the old pitfalls, as the Court treats deference under the rationality rule as subject to gradation according to the commercial or noncommercial nature of the immediate subject of the challenged regulation. The distinction between what is patently commercial and what is not looks much like the old distinction between what directly affects commerce and what touches it only indirectly. And the act of calibrating the level of deference by drawing a line between what is patently commercial and what is less purely so will probably resemble the process of deciding how much interference with contractual freedom was fatal. Thus, it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court today does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago. The answer is not reassuring. To be sure, the occasion for today’s decision reflects the century’s end, not its beginning. But if it seems anomalous that the Congress of the United States has taken to regulating school yards, the Act in question is still probably no more remarkable than state regulation of bake shops 90 years ago. In any event, there is no reason to hope that the Court’s qualification of rational basis review will be any more successful than the efforts at substantive economic review made by our predecessors as the century began.</p><span title="197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-197">p. 197</span>
<p id="fb8ff5eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue in this case is whether the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to enact a statute that makes it a crime to possess a gun in, or near, a school. In my view, the statute falls well within the scope of the commerce power as this Court has understood that power over the last half century.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaching this conclusion, I apply three basic principles of Commerce Clause interpretation. First, the power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,” U.S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3, encompasses the power to regulate local activities insofar as they significantly affect interstate commerce. See, e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden (1824); Wickard v. Filburn. As the majority points out, the Court, in describing how much of an effect the Clause requires, sometimes has used the word “substantial” and sometimes has not.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, in determining whether a local activity will likely have a significant effect upon interstate commerce, a court must consider, not the effect of an individual act (a single instance of gun possession), but rather the cumulative effect of all similar instances (i.e., the effect of all guns possessed in or near schools). See, e.g., <i>Wickard</i>.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Constitution requires us to judge the connection between a regulated activity and interstate commerce, not directly, but at one remove. Courts must give Congress a degree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant factual connection between the regulated activity and interstate commerce—both because the Constitution delegates the commerce power directly to Congress and because the determination requires an empirical judgment of a kind that a legislature is more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional words “rational basis” capture this leeway. Thus, the specific question before us, as the Court recognizes, is not whether the “regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce,” but, rather, whether Congress could have had “a rational basis” for so concluding.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles to the case at hand, we must ask whether Congress could have had a rational basis for finding a significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related school violence and interstate commerce. Or, to put the question in the language of the explicit finding that Congress made when it amended this law in 1994: Could Congress rationally have found that “violent crime in school zones,” through its effect on the “quality of education,” significantly (or substantially) affects “interstate” or “foreign commerce”? As long as one views the commerce connection, not as a “technical legal conception,” but as “a practical one,” the answer to this question must be yes. Numerous reports and studies—generated both inside and outside government—make clear that Congress could reasonably have found the empirical connection that its law, implicitly or explicitly, asserts.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For one thing, reports, hearings, and other readily available literature make clear that the problem of guns in and around schools is widespread and extremely serious. These materials report, for example, that four percent of American high school students (and six percent of inner-city high school students) carry a gun to school at least occasionally, Centers for Disease Control 2342; Sheley, McGee, &amp; Wright 679; that 12 percent of urban high school students have had guns fired at them; that 20 percent of those students have been threatened with guns; and that, in any 6-month period, several hundred thousand schoolchildren are victims of violent crimes in or near their schools, U.S. Dept. of <span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-198">p. 198</span>Justice 1 (1989); House Select Committee Hearing 15 (1989). And, they report that this widespread violence in schools throughout the Nation significantly interferes with the quality of education in those schools. See, e.g., House Judiciary Committee Hearing 44 (1990) (linking school violence to dropout rate); U.S. Dept. of Health 118-119 (1978) (school-violence victims suffer academically). Based on reports such as these, Congress obviously could have thought that guns and learning are mutually exclusive. Congress could therefore have found a substantial educational problem—teachers unable to teach, students unable to learn—and concluded that guns near schools contribute substantially to the size and scope of that problem.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having found that guns in schools significantly undermine the quality of education in our Nation’s classrooms, Congress could also have found, given the effect of education upon interstate and foreign commerce, that gun-related violence in and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem. Education, although far more than a matter of economics, has long been inextricably intertwined with the Nation’s economy.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years the link between secondary education and business has strengthened, becoming both more direct and more important. [T]here is evidence that, today more than ever, many firms base their location decisions upon the presence, or absence, of a work force with a basic education.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specifically, Congress could have found that gun-related violence near the classroom poses a serious economic threat (1) to consequently inadequately educated workers who must endure low paying jobs, and (2) to communities and businesses that might (in today’s “information society”) otherwise gain, from a well-educated work force, an important commercial advantage, of a kind that location near a railhead or harbor provided in the past. Congress might also have found these threats to be no different in kind from other threats that this Court has found within the commerce power, such as the threat that loan sharking poses to the “funds” of “numerous localities,” Perez v. United States, and that unfair labor practices pose to instrumentalities of commerce. As I have pointed out, Congress has written that “the occurrence of violent crime in school zones” has brought about a “decline in the quality of education” that “has an adverse impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of the United States.” The violence-related facts, the educational facts, and the economic facts, taken together, make this conclusion rational. And, because under our case law, the sufficiency of the constitutionally necessary Commerce Clause link between a crime of violence and interstate commerce turns simply upon size or degree, those same facts make the statute constitutional.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hold this statute constitutional is not to “obliterate” the “distinction between what is national and what is local,” . . . ; nor is it to hold that the Commerce Clause permits the Federal Government to “regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens,” to regulate “marriage, divorce, and child custody,” or to regulate any and all aspects of education. First, this statute is aimed at curbing a particularly acute threat to the educational process—the possession (and use) of life-threatening firearms in, or near, the classroom. The empirical evidence that I have discussed above unmistakably documents the special way in which guns and education are incompatible. Second, the immediacy of the connection between education and the national economic well-being is documented by scholars and accepted by society at large in a way and to a degree that may not hold true for other social <span title="199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-199">p. 199</span>institutions. It must surely be the rare case, then, that a statute strikes at conduct that (when considered in the abstract) seems so removed from commerce, but which (practically speaking) has so significant an impact upon commerce.</p>
<p id="fb8ff5f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s holding—that §922 falls outside the scope of the Commerce Clause—creates three serious legal problems. First, the majority’s holding runs contrary to modern Supreme Court cases that have upheld congressional actions despite connections to interstate or foreign commerce that are less significant than the effect of school violence.</p>
<p id="fb901d07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second legal problem the Court creates comes from its apparent belief that it can reconcile its holding with earlier cases by making a critical distinction between “commercial” and noncommercial “transaction[s].” That is to say, the Court believes the Constitution would distinguish between two local activities, each of which has an identical effect upon interstate commerce, if one, but not the other, is “commercial” in nature. As a general matter, this approach fails to heed this Court’s earlier warning not to turn “questions of the power of Congress” upon “formula[s]” that would give “controlling force to nomenclature such as ‘production’ and ‘indirect’ and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb901d08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third legal problem created by the Court’s holding is that it threatens legal uncertainty in an area of law that, until this case, seemed reasonably well settled. Congress has enacted many statutes (more than 100 sections of the United States Code), including criminal statutes (at least 25 sections), that use the words “affecting commerce” to define their scope, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §844(i) (destruction of buildings used in activity affecting interstate commerce), and other statutes that contain no jurisdictional language at all, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §922(o)(1) (possession of machineguns). Do these, or similar, statutes regulate noncommercial activities? If so, would that alter the meaning of “affecting commerce” in a jurisdictional element?</p>
<p id="fb901d09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upholding this legislation would do no more than simply recognize that Congress had a “rational basis” for finding a significant connection between guns in or near schools and (through their effect on education) the interstate and foreign commerce they threaten.</p>

<p id="fb901d12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Christy Brzonkala enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) in the fall of 1994. In September of that year, Brzonkala met respondents <span title="200" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-200">p. 200</span>Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, who were both students at Virginia Tech and members of its varsity football team. Brzonkala alleges that, within 30 minutes of meeting Morrison and Crawford, they assaulted and repeatedly raped her. After the attack, Morrison allegedly told Brzonkala, “You better not have any . . . diseases.” In the months following the rape, Morrison also allegedly announced in the dormitory’s dining room that he “like[d] to get girls drunk and. . . .” The omitted portions, quoted verbatim in the briefs on file with this Court, consist of boasting, debased remarks about what Morrison would do to women, vulgar remarks that cannot fail to shock and offend.</p>
<p id="fb901d13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brzonkala alleges that this attack caused her to become severely emotionally disturbed and depressed. She sought assistance from a university psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressant medication. Shortly after the rape Brzonkala stopped attending classes and withdrew from the university.</p>
<p id="fb904424-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against respondents under Virginia Tech’s Sexual Assault Policy. During the school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison admitted having sexual contact with her despite the fact that she had twice told him “no.” After the hearing, Virginia Tech’s Judicial Committee found insufficient evidence to punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to immediate suspension for two semesters.</p>
<p id="fb904425-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia Tech’s dean of students upheld the judicial committee’s sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a court challenge to his conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy. University officials told her that a second hearing would be necessary to remedy the school’s error in prosecuting her complaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to students. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to an identical 2-semester suspension. This time, however, the description of Morrison’s offense was, without explanation, changed from “sexual assault” to “using abusive language.”</p>
<p id="fb904426-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Morrison appealed his second conviction through the university’s administrative system. On August 21, 1995, Virginia Tech’s senior vice president and provost set aside Morrison’s punishment. After learning from a newspaper that Morrison would be returning to Virginia Tech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of the university.</p>
<p id="fb904427-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December 1995, Brzonkala sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Section 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. It states that “[a]ll persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.” To enforce that right, subsection (c) declares: “A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.” Section 13981 defines a “crim[e] of violence motivated by gender” as “a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim’s gender.”</p>

With this presumption of constitutionality in mind, we turn to the question whether §13981 falls within Congress’s power under Article I, §8, of the Constitution. Brzonkala and the United States rely upon the third clause of the Article, which gives Congress power “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CFE_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CFE_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span></p>
<p id="fb90442b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we discussed at length in <i>Lopez</i>, our interpretation of the Commerce Clause has changed as our Nation has developed. As we observed in <i>Lopez</i>, modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has “identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power.” “First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.” “Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.” “Finally, Congress’s commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.”</p>
<p id="fb90442c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners do not contend that these cases fall within either of the first two of these categories of Commerce Clause regulation. They seek to sustain §13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Given §13981’s focus on gender-motivated violence wherever it occurs (rather than violence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, interstate markets, or things or persons in interstate commerce), we agree that this is the proper inquiry.</p>
<p id="fb90442d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both petitioners and Justice Souter’s dissent downplay the role that the economic nature of the regulated activity plays in our Commerce Clause analysis. But a fair reading of <i>Lopez</i> shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case.</p>
<p id="fb90442e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles underlying our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases, thus far in our Nation’s history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature.</p>
<p id="fb90442f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in <i>Lopez</i>, §13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. In contrast with the lack of congressional findings that we faced in <i>Lopez</i>, §13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. But the existence of congressional findings <span title="202" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-202">p. 202</span>is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation. As we stated in <i>Lopez</i>, “[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.”</p>
<p id="fb904430-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these cases, Congress’s findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution’s enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce “by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; . . . by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711.</p>
<p id="fb904431-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States’ police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners’ reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part. Petitioners’ reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in <i>Lopez</i>, be applied equally as well to family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. Given these findings and petitioners’ arguments, the concern that we expressed in <i>Lopez</i> that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution’s distinction between national and local authority seems well founded.</p>
<p id="fb904432-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local. In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted.</p>

I write separately only to express my view that the very notion of a “substantial effects” test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress’s powers and with this Court’s early Commerce Clause cases. By continuing to apply this rootless and malleable standard, however circumscribed, the Court has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits. Until this Court replaces its existing Commerce Clause jurisprudence with a standard more consistent with the original understanding, we will continue to see Congress appropriating state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.</p><span title="203" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-203">p. 203</span>

<p id="fb906b46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed, stand for the following propositions. Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied.</p>
<p id="fb906b47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying those propositions in these cases can lead to only one conclusion. One obvious difference from United States v. Lopez, is the mountain of data assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce. Passage of the Act in 1994 was preceded by four years of hearings. Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the exercise of its Commerce Clause power. Is its conclusion irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned. Indeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminous than the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges.</p>
<p id="fb906b48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Congress did not, to my knowledge, calculate aggregate dollar values for the nationwide effects of racial discrimination in 1964, in 1994 it did rely on evidence of the harms caused by domestic violence and sexual assault, citing annual costs of $3 billion in 1990. Equally important, though, gender-based violence in the 1990’s was shown to operate in a manner similar to racial discrimination in the 1960’s in reducing the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of goods shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimination, “[g]ender-based violence bars its most likely targets—women—from full partic[ipation] in the national economy.”</p>
<p id="fb906b49-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why is the majority tempted to reject the lesson so painfully learned in 1937? If we now ask why the formalistic economic/noneconomic distinction might matter today, after its rejection in <i>Wickard</i>, the answer is not that the majority fails to see causal connections in an integrated economic world. The answer is that in the minds of the majority there is a new animating theory that makes categorical formalism seem useful again. Just as the old formalism had value in the service of an economic conception, the new one is useful in serving a conception of federalism.</p>
<p id="fb906b4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the instrument by which assertions of national power are to be limited in favor of preserving a supposedly discernible, proper sphere of state autonomy to legislate or refrain from legislating as the individual States see fit. The legitimacy of the Court’s current emphasis on the noncommercial nature of regulated activity, then, does not turn on any logic serving the text of the Commerce Clause or on the realism of the majority’s view of the national economy.</p>
<p id="fb906b4b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="204" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-204">p. 204</span>The Court finds it relevant that the statute addresses conduct traditionally subject to state prohibition under domestic criminal law, a fact said to have some heightened significance when the violent conduct in question is not itself aimed directly at interstate commerce or its instrumentalities. Again, history seems to be recycling, for the theory of traditional state concern as grounding a limiting principle has been rejected previously, and more than once.</p>
<p id="fb906b4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of this convinces me that today’s ebb of the commerce power rests on error, and at the same time leads me to doubt that the majority’s view will prove to be enduring law. There is yet one more reason for doubt. Although we sense the presence of <i>Carter Coal</i>, <i>Schechter</i>, and <i>Usery</i> once again, the majority embraces them only at arm’s-length. Where such decisions once stood for rules, today’s opinion points to considerations by which substantial effects are discounted. Cases standing for the sufficiency of substantial effects are not overruled; cases overruled since 1937 are not quite revived. As our predecessors learned then, the practice of such ad hoc review cannot preserve the distinction between the judicial and the legislative, and this Court, in any event, lacks the institutional capacity to maintain such a regime for very long. This one will end when the majority realizes that the conception of the commerce power for which it entertains hopes would inevitably fail the test expressed in Justice Holmes’s statement that “[t]he first call of a theory of law is that it should fit the facts.” O. Holmes, The Common Law 167 (Howe ed. 1963). The facts that cannot be ignored today are the facts of integrated national commerce and a political relationship between States and Nation much affected by their respective treasuries and constitutional modifications adopted by the people. The federalism of some earlier time is no more adequate to account for those facts today than the theory of laissez-faire was able to govern the national economy 70 years ago.</p>

<p id="fb906b4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In two cases, the Court has narrowly construed federal laws to avoid the question of whether they exceed the scope of Congress’s commerce power. In United States v. Jones, 529 U.S. 848 (2000), the Supreme Court unanimously held that the federal Arson Act does not apply to arson of a dwelling. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, said that applying the Arson Act to arson of a private residence would raise serious constitutional issues concerning Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. As a result, the Court said to avoid “constitutional doubts” it would interpret the law to not apply to such acts.</p>
<p id="fb906b4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court took the same approach, although in a much more closely divided decision, in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001). The issue was whether the Clean Water Act, which applies to “navigable waters,” could be applied to intrastate waters because of the presence of migratory birds. The Court, five to four, said no, holding that it would interpret the statute this way so as to avoid constitutional doubts.</p>
<p id="fb906b4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Rehnquist, working for the Court, stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb906b50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress’ power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. This requirement stems from our prudential desire not to needlessly reach constitutional issues and our assumption that Congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a statute to push the limit of congressional authority. This concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a <span title="205" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-205">p. 205</span>traditional state power. Thus, “where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.”</p>
<p id="fb906b51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Twice in the past six years we have reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See United States v. Morrison (2000); United States v. Lopez (1995). Respondents argue that the “Migratory Bird Rule” falls within Congress’ power to regulate intrastate activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce. They note that the protection of migratory birds is a “national interest of very nearly the first magnitude,” Missouri v. Holland (1920), and that, as the Court of Appeals found, millions of people spend over a billion dollars annually on recreational pursuits relating to migratory birds. These arguments raise significant constitutional questions. For example, we would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. This is not clear, for although the Corps has claimed jurisdiction over petitioner’s land because it contains water areas used as habitat by migratory birds, respondents now focus upon the fact that the regulated activity is petitioner’s municipal landfill, which is “plainly of a commercial nature.” But this is a far cry, indeed, from the “navigable waters” and “waters of the United States” to which the statute by its terms extends.</p>
<p id="fb906b52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are significant constitutional questions raised by respondents’ application of their regulations, and yet we find nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended §404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as we have here. Permitting respondents to claim federal jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats falling within the “Migratory Bird Rule” would result in a significant impingement of the States’ traditional and primary power over land and water use. We thus read the statute as written to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions raised by respondents’ interpretation, and therefore reject the request for administrative deference.</p>

<p id="fb906b53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens, writing for the four dissenting justices, argued that the Army Corps of Engineers had the authority to apply the Clean Water Act to intrastate waters because of the presence of migratory birds. He wrote:</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb906b54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, the Corps’ interpretation of the statute does not “encroac[h]” upon “traditional state power” over land use. “Land use planning in essence chooses particular uses for the land; environmental regulation, at its core, does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.” California Coastal Comm’n v. Granite Rock Co. (1987). The CWA is not a land-use code; it is a paradigm of environmental regulation. Such regulation is an accepted exercise of federal power. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc. (1981).</p>
<p id="fb906b55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Corps’ exercise of its §404 permitting power over “isolated” waters that serve as habitat for migratory birds falls well within the boundaries set by this Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence. In United States v. Lopez (1995), this Court identified “three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power”: (1) channels of interstate commerce; (2) instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons and things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce. The migratory bird rule at issue here is properly analyzed under the third category. In order to constitute a proper exercise of Congress’ power over intrastate activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce, it is not necessary that each individual instance of the activity substantially affect commerce; it is enough that, taken in the aggregate, the class of activities in question has such an effect.</p><span title="206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-206">p. 206</span>
<p id="fb906b56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The activity being regulated in this case (and by the Corps’ §404 regulations in general) is the discharge of fill material into water. The Corps did not assert jurisdiction over petitioner’s land simply because the waters were “used as habitat by migratory birds.” It asserted jurisdiction because petitioner planned to discharge fill into waters “used as habitat by migratory birds.” Had petitioner intended to engage in some other activity besides discharging fill (i.e., had there been no activity to regulate), or, conversely, had the waters not been habitat for migratory birds (i.e., had there been no basis for federal jurisdiction), the Corps would never have become involved in petitioner’s use of its land. There can be no doubt that, unlike the class of activities Congress was attempting to regulate in United States v. Morrison (2000) (“[g]ender-motivated crimes”), and <i>Lopez</i> (possession of guns near school property), the discharge of fill material into the Nation’s waters is almost always undertaken for economic reasons.</p>
<p id="fb906b57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, no one disputes that the discharge of fill into “isolated” waters that serve as migratory bird habitat will, in the aggregate, adversely affect migratory bird populations. Nor does petitioner dispute that the particular waters it seeks to fill are home to many important species of migratory birds, including the second-largest breeding colony of Great Blue Herons in northeastern Illinois, and several species of waterfowl protected by international treaty and Illinois endangered species laws.</p>
<p id="fb909268-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to regulate commerce among the several States necessarily and properly includes the power to preserve the natural resources that generate such commerce. Moreover, the protection of migratory birds is a well-established federal responsibility. As Justice Holmes noted in Missouri v. Holland, the federal interest in protecting these birds is of “the first magnitude.” Because of their transitory nature, they “can be protected only by national action.”</p>

One, Pierce County, Washington v. Guillen, was unanimous and did not engender controversy. The other, Gonzales v. Raich, was enormously controversial and led some commentators to argue that the Court was shifting away from significant limits on Congress’s commerce power.</p>
<p id="fb90926a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Pierce County, Washington v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129 (2003), the Court unanimously reaffirmed broad authority for Congress to legislate concerning road safety as part of its power to regulate the channels of interstate commerce. A federal statute provides that if a local government does a traffic study as part of applying for federal funds, that study is not discoverable. Congress’s concern was that local governments would refrain from conducting such investigations if they could be used as evidence against them in suits arising from automobile accidents.</p>
<p id="fb90926b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Guillen</i> involved two separate accidents at intersections in the state of Washington, and the local governments had recently conducted studies of traffic conditions at both locations. The plaintiffs sued the local governments and sought access to the traffic studies. The Washington Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the federal law that exempted these studies from discovery. The U.S. Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, unanimously reversed and upheld the federal law. Justice Thomas explained that “[i]t is well established that the Commerce Clause gives Congress authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. . . . [The statutes] can be viewed as legislation aimed at improving safety in the channels of interstate commerce and increasing protection for the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. As such, they fall within Congress’ Commerce Clause power.”</p>

<p id="fb909274-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">California has been a pioneer in the regulation of marijuana. In 1913, California was one of the first States to prohibit the sale and possession of marijuana, and at the end of the century, California became the first State to authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes. In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now codified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. The proposition was designed to ensure that “seriously ill” residents of the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes, and to encourage Federal and State Governments to take steps towards ensuring the safe and affordable distribution of the drug to patients in need. The Act creates an exemption from criminal prosecution for physicians, as well as for patients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician.</p>
<p id="fb909275-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are California residents who suffer from a variety of serious medical conditions and have sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use Act. They are being treated by licensed, board-certified family practitioners, who have concluded, after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat respondents’ conditions and to alleviate their associated symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment. Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors’ recommendation, and both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis. Indeed, Raich’s physician believes that forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal.</p>
<p id="fb909276-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents brought this action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.</p>
<p id="fb909277-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case is made difficult by respondents’ strong arguments that they will suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional finding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes. The question before us, however, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circumstances; rather, it is whether Congress’ power to regulate interstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses the portions of those markets that are supplied with <span title="208" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-208">p. 208</span>drugs produced and consumed locally.

<p id="fb90b989-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon declared a national “war on drugs.” As the first campaign of that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs. That effort culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.</p>
<p id="fb90b98a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Subsequently, Congress enacted the CSA and] Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA. The CSA categorizes all controlled substances into five schedules. The drugs are grouped together based on their accepted medical uses, the potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls regarding the manufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed therein. The CSA and its implementing regulations set forth strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping.</p>
<p id="fb90b98b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug.

Nor do they contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority. Rather, respondents’ challenge is actually quite limited; they argue that the CSA’s categorical prohibition of the manufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana for medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fb90b98e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in isolation. As charted in considerable detail in United States v. Lopez, our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause, as well as Congress’ assertion of authority thereunder, has evolved over time. Cases decided during that “new era,” which now spans more than a century, have identified three general categories of regulation in which Congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power. First, Congress can regulate the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress has authority to <span title="209" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-209">p. 209</span>regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce. Third, Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Only the third category is implicated in the case at hand.</p>
<p id="fb90b98f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our case law firmly establishes Congress’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, e.g., Wickard v. Filburn (1942). As we stated in <i>Wickard</i>, “even if appellee’s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.” We have never required Congress to legislate with scientific exactitude. When Congress decides that the “total incidence” of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class. In this vein, we have reiterated that when “a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.”</p>
<p id="fb90b990-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision in <i>Wickard</i> is of particular relevance. In <i>Wickard</i>, we upheld the application of regulations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, which were designed to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent abnormally low prices. <i>Wickard</i> thus establishes that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,” in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.</p>
<p id="fb90b991-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The similarities between this case and <i>Wickard</i> are striking. Like the farmer in <i>Wickard</i>, respondents are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market. Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was designed “to control the volume [of wheat] moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses . . .” and consequently control the market price, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug markets. In <i>Wickard</i>, we had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. Here too, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.</p>
<p id="fb90b992-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interstate market, resulting in lower market prices. The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market. While the diversion of homegrown wheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabilizing prices by regulating the volume of commercial transactions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown marijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market in their entirety. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress’ commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana<span title="210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-210">p. 210</span>, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E5E_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E5E_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span></p>
<p id="fb90e0a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing the scope of Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a modest one. We need not determine whether respondents’ activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a “rational basis” exists for so concluding. Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U.S.C. §801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus, as in <i>Wickard</i>, when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity, Congress was acting well within its authority to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper” to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.” U.S. Const., Art. I, §8. That the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment. As we have done many times before, we refuse to excise individual components of that larger scheme.</p>

<p id="fb90e0a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To support their contrary submission, respondents rely heavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases. In their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases. Moreover, even in the narrow prism of respondents’ creation, they read those cases far too broadly. Those two cases, of course, are United States v. Lopez (1995) and United States v. Morrison (2000). As an initial matter, the statutory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly different from the challenge respondents pursue in the case at hand. Here, respondents ask us to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme. In contrast, in both <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i>, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress’ commerce power in its entirety. This distinction is pivotal for we have often reiterated that “[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power ‘to excise, as trivial, individual instances’ of the class.”</p>
<p id="fb90e0a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike those at issue in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i>, the activities regulated by the CSA are quintessentially economic. “Economics” refers to “the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1966). The CSA is a statute that regulates the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that product. Such prohibitions include specific <span title="211" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-211">p. 211</span>decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from the market as a result of the failure to comply with regulatory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule I drugs entirely from the market. Because the CSA is a statute that directly regulates economic, commercial activity, our opinion in <i>Morrison</i> casts no doubt on its constitutionality.</p>

<p id="fb90e0a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents also raise a substantive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity defense. These theories of relief were set forth in their complaint but were not reached by the Court of Appeals. We therefore do not address the question whether judicial relief is available to respondents on these alternative bases. We do note, however, the presence of another avenue of relief. As the Solicitor General confirmed during oral argument, the statute authorizes procedures for the reclassification of Schedule I drugs. But perhaps even more important than these legal avenues is the democratic process, in which the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress.</p>
<p id="fb90e0aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fb90e0ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court’s holding that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) may validly be applied to respondents’ cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana for personal, medicinal use. I write separately because my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on which that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of the Court, at least more nuanced.</p>
<p id="fb90e0ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since Perez v. United States (1971), our cases have mechanically recited that the Commerce Clause permits congressional regulation of three categories: (1) the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce. The first two categories are self-evident, since they are the ingredients of interstate commerce itself. The third category, however, is different in kind, and its recitation without explanation is misleading and incomplete.</p>
<p id="fb90e0ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is misleading because, unlike the channels, instrumentalities, and agents of interstate commerce, activities that substantially affect interstate commerce are not themselves part of interstate commerce, and thus the power to regulate them cannot come from the Commerce Clause alone. Rather, Congress’s regulatory authority over intrastate activities that are not themselves part of interstate commerce (including activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper Clause. And the category of “activities that substantially affect interstate commerce” is incomplete because the authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws governing intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb90e0ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The application of these principles to the case before us is straightforward. In the CSA, Congress has undertaken to extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce <span title="212" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-212">p. 212</span>Clause unquestionably permits this. The power to regulate interstate commerce “extends not only to those regulations which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those which prohibit it.” To effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all intrastate activities related to Schedule I substances—both economic activities (manufacture, distribution, possession with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic activities (simple possession). That simple possession is a noneconomic activity is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a necessary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress’s authority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether they are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fb90e0af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By this measure, I think the regulation must be sustained. Not only is it impossible to distinguish “controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate” from “controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate,” but it hardly makes sense to speak in such terms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities. As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home and possessed for personal use is never more than an instant from the interstate market—and this is so whether or not the possession is for medicinal use or lawful use under the laws of a particular State. Congress need not accept on faith that state law will be effective in maintaining a strict division between a lawful market for “medical” marijuana and the more general marijuana market.</p>
<p id="fb90e0b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of regulated activities is subdivided, Congress could reasonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting marijuana from the interstate market “could be undercut” if those activities were excepted from its general scheme of regulation. That is sufficient to authorize the application of the CSA to respondents.</p>
<p id="fb9107c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> join as to all but Part III, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb9107c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We enforce the “outer limits” of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority not for their own sake, but to protect historic spheres of state sovereignty from excessive federal encroachment and thereby to maintain the distribution of power fundamental to our federalist system of government. United States v. Lopez (1995). One of federalism’s chief virtues, of course, is that it promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that “a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="fb9107c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case exemplifies the role of States as laboratories. The States’ core police powers have always included authority to define criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. Exercising those powers, California (by ballot initiative and then by legislative codification) has come to its own conclusion about the difficult and sensitive question of whether marijuana should be available to relieve severe pain and suffering. Today the Court sanctions an application of the federal Controlled Substances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of federal regulation. In so doing, the Court announces a rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate broadly pursuant to the Commerce <span title="213" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-213">p. 213</span>Clause—nestling questionable assertions of its authority into comprehensive regulatory schemes—rather than with precision. That rule and the result it produces in this case are irreconcilable with our decisions in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i>. Accordingly I dissent.</p>
<p id="fb9107c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s principal means of distinguishing <i>Lopez</i> from this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a “brief, single-subject statute,” whereas the CSA is “a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of ‘controlled substances.’” Thus, according to the Court, it was possible in <i>Lopez</i> to evaluate in isolation the constitutionality of criminalizing local activity (there gun possession in school zones), whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this case cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal medicinal use) cannot be separated from the general drug control scheme of which it is a part.</p>
<p id="fb9107c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision allows Congress to regulate intrastate activity without check, so long as there is some implication by legislative design that regulating intrastate activity is essential (and the Court appears to equate “essential” with “necessary”) to the interstate regulatory scheme. Seizing upon our language in <i>Lopez</i> that the statute prohibiting gun possession in school zones was “not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated,” the Court appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a comprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that scheme. If the Court is right, then <i>Lopez</i> stands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress should have described the relevant crime as “transfer or possession of a firearm anywhere in the nation”—thus including commercial and noncommercial activity, and clearly encompassing some activity with assuredly substantial effect on interstate commerce. Had it done so, the majority hints, we would have sustained its authority to regulate possession of firearms in school zones. Furthermore, today’s decision suggests we would readily sustain a congressional decision to attach the regulation of intrastate activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-so-comprehensive) scheme. If so, the Court invites increased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it suggests, Congress would not enact a new interstate scheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate activity. I cannot agree that our decision in <i>Lopez</i> contemplated such evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with approval. Until today, such arguments have been made only in dissent. If the Court always defers to Congress as it does today, little may be left to the notion of enumerated powers.</p>
<p id="fb9107c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for one’s own medicinal use can properly be characterized as economic, and I question whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity substantially affects interstate commerce. Similarly, it is neither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating such activity is necessary to the interstate drug control scheme.</p>
<p id="fb9107c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s definition of economic activity is breathtaking. It defines as economic any activity involving the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities. And it appears to reason that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating its market. Putting to one side the problem endemic to the Court’s opinion—the shift in <span title="214" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-214">p. 214</span>focus from the activity at issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regulates—the Court’s definition of economic activity for purposes of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.</p>
<p id="fb9107c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this case, the Government has made no showing in fact that the possession and use of homegrown marijuana for medical purposes, in California or elsewhere, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Similarly, the Government has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme. Whatever the specific theory of “substantial effects” at issue (i.e., whether the activity substantially affects interstate commerce, whether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty requires that Congress’ excursion into the traditional domain of States be justified.</p>
<p id="fb9107c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is why characterizing this as a case about the Necessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis significantly. Congress must exercise its authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent with basic constitutional principles. Likewise, that authority must be used in a manner consistent with the notion of enumerated powers—a structural principle that is as much part of the Constitution as the Tenth Amendment’s explicit textual command. Accordingly, something more than mere assertion is required when Congress purports to have power over local activity whose connection to an interstate market is not self-evident. Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will always be a back door for unconstitutional federal regulation.</p>
<p id="fb9107ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal marijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable enough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial, impact on the national illicit drug market—or otherwise to threaten the CSA regime.</p>
<p id="fb912edb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that the number of Californians engaged in personal cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the amount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten the federal regime. Nor has it shown that Compassionate Use Act marijuana users have been or are realistically likely to be responsible for the drug’s seeping into the market in a significant way. The Government does cite one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate Use Act users in California in 2004, but does not explain, in terms of proportions, what their presence means for the national illicit drug market.</p>
<p id="fb912edc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying on Congress’ abstract assertions, the Court has endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one’s own home for one’s own medicinal use. This overreaching stifles an express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act. But whatever the wisdom of California’s experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case. For these reasons I dissent.</p>
<p id="fb912edd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb912ede-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has had no <span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-215">p. 215</span>demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.</p>
<p id="fb912edf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not “Commerce . . . among the several States.” By holding that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution’s limits on federal power. The majority supports this conclusion by invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and Proper Clause. Regulating respondents’ conduct, however, is not “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” Congress’ restrictions on the interstate drug trade. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to regulate respondents’ conduct.</p>
<p id="fb912ee0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As I explained at length in United States v. Lopez (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and services trafficked across state lines. The Clause’s text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term “‘commerce’ consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.” Commerce, or trade, stood in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and agriculture.</p>
<p id="fb912ee1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that “commerce” included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.</p>
<p id="fb912ee2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress’ power to enact laws that are “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” its power to regulate interstate commerce. The Necessary and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the exercise of an enumerated power. Nor is it, however, a command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.</p>
<p id="fb912ee3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its application to respondents has the Government offered any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking. Congress’ goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless Congress’ aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrastate possession and use of marijuana.</p>
</div><p id="fb912ee4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority prevents States like California from devising drug policies that they have concluded provide much-needed respite to the seriously ill. It does so without any serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or the propriety of “displac[ing] state regulation in areas of traditional state concern.” The majority’s rush to embrace federal power “is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union.” Our federalist system, properly understood, allows California and a growing number of other States to decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens.</p>

<p id="fb912ee7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first indication of the revival of the Tenth Amendment occurred in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991). State court judges in Missouri challenged a provision of the Missouri Constitution that set a mandatory retirement age as violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The Supreme Court held that a federal law will be applied to important state government activities only if there is a clear statement from Congress that the law was meant to apply. The Court did not use the Tenth Amendment to invalidate the federal law on its face or as applied. Instead, the Court used the Tenth Amendment and federalism considerations as a rule of construction. The Court ruled that a federal law that imposes a substantial burden on a state government will be applied only if Congress clearly indicated that it wanted the law to apply. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act lacks such a clear statement, and hence the Court refused to apply it to preempt the Missouri mandatory retirement age. Justice O’Connor, writing for the Court, discussed the importance of autonomous state governments as a check on possible federal tyranny and stressed the significance of the Tenth Amendment as a constitutional protector of state sovereignty.</p>
<p id="fb912ee8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There have been four decisions following Gregory v. Ashcroft that considered whether a federal law violates the Tenth Amendment. In three—New York v. United States, Printz v. United States, and Murphy v.

These cases are presented in chronological order below. In focusing on them, and especially in comparing the two most recent cases—Reno v. Condon and Murphy v.

The constitutional question is as old as the Constitution: It consists of discerning the proper division of authority between the Federal Government and the States.

<p id="fb917d17-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The task of ascertaining the constitutional line between federal and state power has given rise to many of the Court’s most difficult and celebrated cases.</p>
<p id="fb917d18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These questions can be viewed in either of two ways. In some cases the Court has inquired whether an Act of Congress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to Congress in Article I of the Constitution. See, e.g., Perez v. United States (1971); McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). In other cases the Court has sought to determine whether an Act of Congress invades the province of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment. See, e.g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985). In a case like these, involving the division of authority between federal and state governments, the two inquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power to the States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a power the Constitution has not conferred on Congress.</p>
<p id="fb917d19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress exercises its conferred powers subject to the limitations contained in the Constitution. Thus, for example, under the Commerce Clause Congress may regulate publishers engaged in interstate commerce, but Congress is constrained in the exercise of that power by the First Amendment. The Tenth Amendment likewise restrains the power of Congress, but this limit is not <span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-218">p. 218</span>derived from the text of the Tenth Amendment itself, which, as we have discussed, is essentially a tautology. Instead, the Tenth Amendment confirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power to the States. The Tenth Amendment thus directs us to determine, as in this case, whether an incident of state sovereignty is protected by a limitation on an Article I power.</p>

<p id="fb917d1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners do not contend that Congress lacks the power to regulate the disposal of low level radioactive waste. Space in radioactive waste disposal sites is frequently sold by residents of one State to residents of another. Regulation of the resulting interstate market in waste disposal is therefore well within Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause. Petitioners likewise do not dispute that under the Supremacy Clause Congress could, if it wished, pre-empt state radioactive waste regulation. Petitioners contend only that the Tenth Amendment limits the power of Congress to regulate in the way it has chosen. Rather than addressing the problem of waste disposal by directly regulating the generators and disposers of waste, petitioners argue, Congress has impermissibly directed the States to regulate in this field.</p>
<p id="fb917d1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of our recent cases interpreting the Tenth Amendment have concerned the authority of Congress to subject state governments to generally applicable laws. This litigation presents no occasion to apply or revisit the holdings of any of these cases, as this is not a case in which Congress has subjected a State to the same legislation applicable to private parties.</p>
<p id="fb917d1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This litigation instead concerns the circumstances under which Congress may use the States as implements of regulation; that is, whether Congress may direct or otherwise motivate the States to regulate in a particular field or a particular way. Our cases have established a few principles that guide our resolution of the issue.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb917d1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">1</p></div>
<p id="fb917d1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an initial matter, Congress may not simply “commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.” While Congress has substantial powers to govern the Nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the States, the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress’s instructions.</p>
<p id="fb917d20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the question whether the Constitution should permit Congress to employ state governments as regulatory agencies was a topic of lively debate among the framers. In providing for a stronger central government, therefore, the framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States. As we have seen, the Court has consistently respected this choice. We have always understood that even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts. The allocation of power contained in the Commerce Clause, for example, authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulate state governments’ regulation of interstate commerce.</p>

<p id="fb917d22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that Congress lacks the ability to encourage a State to regulate in a particular way, or that Congress may not hold out incentives to the States as a method of influencing a State’s policy choices. Our cases have identified a variety of methods, short of outright coercion, by which Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislative program consistent with federal interests. Two of these methods are of particular relevance here.</p>
<p id="fb917d23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, under Congress’s spending power, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds.” South Dakota v. Dole (1986). Such conditions must (among other requirements) bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending; otherwise, of course, the spending power could render academic the Constitution’s other grants and limits of federal authority. Where the recipient of federal funds is a State, as is not unusual today, the conditions attached to the funds by Congress may influence a State’s legislative choices.</p>
<p id="fb91a434-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause, we have recognized Congress’s power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation. This arrangement, which has been termed “a program of cooperative federalism,” is replicated in numerous federal statutory schemes. These include the Clean Water Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.</p>
<p id="fb91a435-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By either of these methods, as by any other permissible method of encouraging a State to conform to federal policy choices, the residents of the State retain the ultimate decision as to whether or not the State will comply. If a State’s citizens view federal policy as sufficiently contrary to local interests, they may elect to decline a federal grant. If state residents would prefer their government to devote its attention and resources to problems other than those deemed important by Congress, they may choose to have the Federal Government rather than the State bear the expense of a federally mandated regulatory program, and they may continue to supplement that program to the extent state law is not pre-empted. Where Congress encourages state regulation rather than compelling it, state governments remain responsive to the local electorate’s preferences; state officials remain accountable to the people.</p>
<p id="fb91a436-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, where the Federal Government compels States to regulate, the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished. If the citizens of New York, for example, do not consider that making provision for the disposal of radioactive waste is in their best interest, they may elect state officials who share their view. That view can always be pre-empted under the Supremacy Clause if it is contrary to the national view, but in such a case it is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular. But where the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision. Accountability is thus diminished when, due to federal coercion, elected state officials cannot regulate in accordance with the views of the local electorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.</p>
<p id="fb91a437-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles in mind, we turn to the three challenged provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.</p>

<p id="fb91a439-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court upheld the monetary and access incentives created by Congress for states to open waste sites. The Court found that the former was permissible as an exercise of the spending power. The Court found the second was permissible under Congress’s authority to encourage compacts among the states.]</p>
<p id="fb91a43a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The take title provision is of a different character. In this provision, Congress has crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.</p>
<p id="fb91a43b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The take title provision offers state governments a “choice” of either accepting ownership of waste or regulating according to the instructions of Congress. Respondents do not claim that the Constitution would authorize Congress to impose either option as a freestanding requirement. On one hand, the Constitution would not permit Congress simply to transfer radioactive waste from generators to state governments. Such a forced transfer, standing alone, would in principle be no different than a congressionally compelled subsidy from state governments to radioactive waste producers. The same is true of the provision requiring the States to become liable for the generators’ damages. Standing alone, this provision would be indistinguishable from an Act of Congress directing the States to assume the liabilities of certain state residents. Either type of federal action would “commandeer” state governments into the service of federal regulatory purposes, and would for this reason be inconsistent with the Constitution’s division of authority between federal and state governments. On the other hand, the second alternative held out to state governments—regulating pursuant to Congress’s direction—would, standing alone, present a simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress. As we have seen, the Constitution does not empower Congress to subject state governments to this type of instruction.</p>
<p id="fb91a43c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because an instruction to state governments to take title to waste, standing alone, would be beyond the authority of Congress, and because a direct order to regulate, standing alone, would also be beyond the authority of Congress, it follows that Congress lacks the power to offer the States a choice between the two. A choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatory techniques is no choice at all. Either way, “the Act commandeers the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program,” Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., an outcome that has never been understood to lie within the authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb91a43d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents emphasize the latitude given to the States to implement Congress’s plan. The Act enables the States to regulate pursuant to Congress’s instructions in any number of different ways. States may avoid taking title by contracting with sited regional compacts, by building a disposal site alone or as part of a compact, or by permitting private parties to build a disposal site. States that host sites may employ a wide range of designs and disposal methods, subject only to broad federal regulatory limits. This line of reasoning, however, only underscores the critical alternative a State lacks: A State may not decline to administer the federal program. No matter which path the State chooses, it must follow the direction of Congress.</p>
<p id="fb91a43e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The take title provision appears to be unique. No other federal statute has been cited which offers a state government no option other than that of implementing legislation enacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title <span title="221" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-221">p. 221</span>provision as lying outside Congress’s enumerated powers, or as infringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with the federal structure of our Government established by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb91a43f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States argues that the Constitution’s prohibition of congressional directives to state governments can be overcome where the federal interest is sufficiently important to justify state submission. But whether or not a particularly strong federal interest enables Congress to bring state governments within the orbit of generally applicable federal regulation, no Member of the Court has ever suggested that such a federal interest would enable Congress to command a state government to enact state regulation. No matter how powerful the federal interest involved, the Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate. The Constitution instead gives Congress the authority to regulate matters directly and to pre-empt contrary state regulation. Where a federal interest is sufficiently strong to cause Congress to legislate, it must do so directly; it may not conscript state governments as its agents.</p>
<p id="fb91a440-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sited state respondents focus their attention on the process by which the Act was formulated. They correctly observe that public officials representing the State of New York lent their support to the Act’s enactment. Respondents note that the Act embodies a bargain among the sited and unsited States, a compromise to which New York was a willing participant and from which New York has reaped much benefit. Respondents then pose what appears at first to be a troubling question: How can a federal statute be found an unconstitutional infringement of state sovereignty when state officials consented to the statute’s enactment?</p>
<p id="fb91ca51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer follows from an understanding of the fundamental purpose served by our Government’s federal structure. The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty of States for the benefit of the States or state governments as abstract political entities, or even for the benefit of the public officials governing the States. To the contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: “Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power. Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.” Gregory v. Ashcroft (1991).</p>
<p id="fb91ca52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where Congress exceeds its authority relative to the States, therefore, the departure from the constitutional plan cannot be ratified by the “consent” of state officials. An analogy to the separation of powers among the branches of the Federal Government clarifies this point. The Constitution’s division of power among the three branches is violated where one branch invades the territory of another, whether or not the encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment. State officials thus cannot consent to the enlargement of the powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb91ca53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">States are not mere political subdivisions of the United States. State governments are neither regional offices nor administrative agencies of the Federal Government. The positions occupied by state officials appear nowhere on the Federal Government’s most detailed organizational chart. The Constitution instead “leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty,” The <span title="222" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-222">p. 222</span>Federalist No. 39, reserved explicitly to the States by the Tenth Amendment. Whatever the outer limits of that sovereignty may be, one thing is clear: The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. The Constitution permits both the Federal Government and the States to enact legislation regarding the disposal of low level radioactive waste. The Constitution enables the Federal Government to pre-empt state regulation contrary to federal interests, and it permits the Federal Government to hold out incentives to the States as a means of encouraging them to adopt suggested regulatory schemes. It does not, however, authorize Congress simply to direct the States to provide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generated within their borders. While there may be many constitutional methods of achieving regional self-sufficiency in radioactive waste disposal, the method Congress has chosen is not one of them.</p>
<p id="fb91ca54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="fb91ca55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today affirms the constitutionality of two facets of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (1985 Act). These provisions include the monetary incentives from surcharges collected by States with low-level radioactive waste storage sites, and the “access incentives,” which deny access to disposal sites for States that fail to meet certain deadlines for low-level radioactive waste disposal management. The Court strikes down and severs a third component of the 1985 Act, the “take title” provision, which requires a noncomplying State to take title to or to assume liability for its low-level radioactive waste if it fails to provide for the disposal of such waste by January 1, 1996. The Court deems this last provision unconstitutional under principles of federalism. Because I believe the Court has mischaracterized the essential inquiry, misanalyzed the inquiry it has chosen to undertake, and undervalued the effect the seriousness of this public policy problem should have on the constitutionality of the take title provision, I respectfully dissent from [this aspect] of its opinion.</p>

<p id="fb91ca57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My disagreement with the Court’s analysis begins at the basic descriptive level of how the legislation at issue in these cases came to be enacted. The Court goes some way toward setting out the bare facts, but its omissions cast the statutory context of the take title provision in the wrong light. To read the Court’s version of events, one would think that Congress was the sole proponent of a solution to the Nation’s low-level radioactive waste problem. Not so. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 (1980 Act), and its amendatory 1985 Act, resulted from the efforts of state leaders to achieve a state-based set of remedies to the waste problem. They sought not federal pre-emption or intervention, but rather congressional sanction of interstate compromises they had reached.</p>
<p id="fb91ca58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two signal events in 1979 that precipitated movement toward legislation were the temporary closing of the Nevada disposal site in July 1979, after several serious transportation-related incidents, and the temporary shutting of the Washington disposal site because of similar transportation and packaging problems in October 1979. At that time the facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, <span title="223" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-223">p. 223</span>received approximately three-quarters of the Nation’s low-level radioactive waste, and the Governor ordered a 50 percent reduction in the amount his State’s plant would accept for disposal. The Governor of Washington threatened to shut down the Hanford, Washington, facility entirely by 1982 unless “some meaningful progress occurs toward” development of regional solutions to the waste disposal problem. Only three sites existed in the country for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and the “sited” States confronted the undesirable alternatives either of continuing to be the dumping grounds for the entire Nation’s low-level waste or of eliminating or reducing in a constitutional manner the amount of waste accepted for disposal.</p>
<p id="fb91ca59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The imminence of a crisis in low-level radioactive waste management cannot be overstated. Accordingly, the National Governors’ Association Task Force urged that “each state should accept primary responsibility for the safe disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders” and that “the states should pursue a regional approach to the low-level waste disposal problem.”</p>
<p id="fb91ca5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A movement thus arose to achieve a compromise between the sited and the unsited States, in which the sited States agreed to continue accepting waste in exchange for the imposition of stronger measures to guarantee compliance with the unsited States’ assurances that they would develop alternative disposal facilities. The bill that in large measure became the 1985 Act “represent[ed] the diligent negotiating undertaken by” the National Governors’ Association and “embodied” the “fundamentals of their settlement.”</p>
<p id="fb91ca5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike legislation that directs action from the Federal Government to the States, the 1980 and 1985 Acts reflected hard-fought agreements among States as refereed by Congress. The distinction is key, and the Court’s failure properly to characterize this legislation ultimately affects its analysis of the take title provision’s constitutionality.</p>

<p id="fb91f16d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even were New York not to be estopped from challenging the take title provision’s constitutionality, I am convinced that, seen as a term of an agreement entered into between the several States, this measure proves to be less constitutionally odious than the Court opines. First, the practical effect of New York’s position is that because it is unwilling to honor its obligations to provide in-state storage facilities for its low-level radioactive waste, other States with such plants must accept New York’s waste, whether they wish to or not. Otherwise, the many economically and socially beneficial producers of such waste in the State would have to cease their operations. The Court’s refusal to force New York to accept responsibility for its own problem inevitably means that some other State’s sovereignty will be impinged by it being forced, for public health reasons, to accept New York’s low-level radioactive waste. I do not understand the principle of federalism to impede the National Government from acting as referee among the States to prohibit one from bullying another.</p>
<p id="fb91f16e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, it is utterly reasonable that, in crafting a delicate compromise between the three overburdened States that provided low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities and the rest of the States, Congress would have to ratify some punitive measure as the ultimate sanction for noncompliance. The take title provision, though surely onerous, does not take effect if the generator of <span title="224" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-224">p. 224</span>the waste does not request such action, or if the State lives up to its bargain of providing a waste disposal facility either within the State or in another State pursuant to a regional compact arrangement or a separate contract.</p>

<p id="fb91f170-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court announces that it has no occasion to revisit such decisions as Gregory v. Ashcroft (1991); South Carolina v. Baker (1988); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985); EEOC v. Wyoming (1983); and National League of Cities v. Usery (1976). Although this statement sends the welcome signal that the Court does not intend to cut a wide swath through our recent Tenth Amendment precedents, it nevertheless is unpersuasive. I have several difficulties with the Court’s analysis in this respect: It builds its rule around an insupportable and illogical distinction in the types of alleged incursions on state sovereignty; it derives its rule from cases that do not support its analysis; it fails to apply the appropriate tests from the cases on which it purports to base its rule; and it omits any discussion of the most recent and pertinent test for determining the take title provision’s constitutionality.</p>
<p id="fb91f171-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s distinction between a federal statute’s regulation of States and private parties for general purposes, as opposed to a regulation solely on the activities of States, is unsupported by our recent Tenth Amendment cases. In no case has the Court rested its holding on such a distinction. Moreover, the Court makes no effort to explain why this purported distinction should affect the analysis of Congress’s power under general principles of federalism and the Tenth Amendment. The distinction, facilely thrown out, is not based on any defensible theory. An incursion on state sovereignty hardly seems more constitutionally acceptable if the federal statute that “commands” specific action also applies to private parties. The alleged diminution in state authority over its own affairs is not any less because the federal mandate restricts the activities of private parties.</p>
<p id="fb91f172-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the scanty textual support for the majority’s position, it would be far more sensible to defer to a coordinate branch of government in its decision to devise a solution to a national problem of this kind. Certainly in other contexts, principles of federalism have not insulated States from mandates by the National Government. The Court has upheld congressional statutes that impose clear directives on state officials, including those enacted pursuant to the Extradition Clause, see, e.g., Puerto Rico v. Branstad (1987), the post-Civil War Amendments, see, e.g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), as well as congressional statutes that require state courts to hear certain actions, see, e.g., Testa v. Katt (1947).</p>

<p id="fb91f174-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the take title provision is unconstitutional, I do not read its opinion to preclude Congress from adopting a similar measure through its powers under the Spending or Commerce Clauses. The Court makes clear that its objection is to the alleged “commandeer[ing]” quality of the take title provision. The spending power offers a means of <span title="225" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-225">p. 225</span>enacting a take title provision under the Court’s standards. Congress could, in other words, condition the payment of funds on the State’s willingness to take title if it has not already provided a waste disposal facility.</p>
<p id="fb91f175-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, should a State fail to establish a waste disposal facility by the appointed deadline (under the statute as presently drafted, January 1, 1996) Congress has the power pursuant to the Commerce Clause to regulate directly the producers of the waste. Thus, as I read it, Congress could amend the statute to say that if a State fails to meet the January 1, 1996, deadline for achieving a means of waste disposal, and has not taken title to the waste, no low-level radioactive waste may be shipped out of the State of New York. This background suggests that the threat of federal pre-emption may suffice to induce States to accept responsibility for failing to meet critical time deadlines for solving their low-level radioactive waste disposal problems, especially if that federal intervention also would strip state and local authorities of any input in locating sites for low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. And should Congress amend the statute to meet the Court’s objection and a State refuse to act, the National Legislature will have ensured at least a federal solution to the waste management problem.</p>
<p id="fb91f176-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, our precedents leave open the possibility that Congress may create federal rights of action in the generators of low-level radioactive waste against persons acting under color of state law for their failure to meet certain functions designated in federal-state programs.</p>

<p id="fb921888-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ultimate irony of the decision today is that in its formalistically rigid obeisance to “federalism,” the Court gives Congress fewer incentives to defer to the wishes of state officials in achieving local solutions to local problems. By invalidating the measure designed to ensure compliance for recalcitrant States, such as New York, the Court upsets the delicate compromise achieved among the States and forces Congress to erect several additional formalistic hurdles to clear before achieving exactly the same objective. Because the Court’s justifications for undertaking this step are unpersuasive to me, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fb921889-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="fb92188a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Articles of Confederation, the Federal Government had the power to issue commands to the States. Because that indirect exercise of federal power proved ineffective, the framers of the Constitution empowered the Federal Government to exercise legislative authority directly over individuals within the States, even though that direct authority constituted a greater intrusion on state sovereignty. Nothing in that history suggests that the Federal Government may not also impose its will upon the several States as it did under the Articles. The Constitution enhanced, rather than diminished, the power of the Federal Government.</p>
<p id="fb92188b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The notion that Congress does not have the power to issue “a simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress,” is incorrect and unsound. There is no such limitation in the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment surely does not impose any limit on Congress’s exercise of the powers delegated to it by Article I. Nor does the structure of the constitutional order <span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-226">p. 226</span>or the values of federalism mandate such a formal rule. To the contrary, the Federal Government directs state governments in many realms. The Government regulates state-operated railroads, state school systems, state prisons, state elections, and a host of other state functions. Similarly, there can be no doubt that, in time of war, Congress could either draft soldiers itself or command the States to supply their quotas of troops. I see no reason why Congress may not also command the States to enforce federal water and air quality standards or federal standards for the disposition of low-level radioactive wastes.</p>

<p id="fb921892-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented in these cases is whether certain interim provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, commanding state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers and to perform certain related tasks, violate the Constitution.</p>

In 1993, Congress amended the GCA by enacting the Brady Act. The Act requires the Attorney General to establish a national instant background check system by November 30, 1998, and immediately puts in place certain interim provisions until that system becomes operative. Under the interim provisions, [state and local law enforcement personnel must do background checks before issuing permit for firearms].</p>

<p id="fb923fa7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the description set forth above, it is apparent that the Brady Act purports to direct state law enforcement officers to participate, albeit only temporarily, in the administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. Regulated firearms dealers are required to forward Brady Forms not to a federal officer or employee, but to the CLEOs, whose obligation to accept those forms is implicit in the duty imposed upon them to make “reasonable efforts” within five days to determine whether the sales reflected in the forms are lawful. While the CLEOs are subjected to no federal requirement that they prevent the sales determined to be unlawful (it is perhaps assumed that their state-law duties will require prevention or apprehension), they are empowered to grant, in effect, waivers of the federally prescribed 5-day waiting period for handgun purchases by notifying the gun dealers that they have no reason to believe the transactions would be illegal.</p>
<p id="fb923fa8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-227">p. 227</span>The petitioners here object to being pressed into federal service, and contend that congressional action compelling state officers to execute federal laws is unconstitutional. Because there is no constitutional text speaking to this precise question, the answer to the CLEOs’ challenge must be sought in historical understanding and practice, in the structure of the Constitution, and in the jurisprudence of this Court. We treat those three sources, in that order, in this and the next two sections of this opinion.</p>
<p id="fb923fa9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend that compelled enlistment of state executive officers for the administration of federal programs is, until very recent years at least, unprecedented. The Government contends, to the contrary, that “the earliest Congresses enacted statutes that required the participation of state officials in the implementation of federal laws.” The Government’s contention demands our careful consideration, since early congressional enactments “provid[e] ‘contemporaneous and weighty evidence’ of the Constitution’s meaning,” Bowsher v. Synar (1986). Indeed, such “contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution . . . , acquiesced in for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given its provisions.” Myers v. United States (1926) (citing numerous cases). Conversely if, as petitioners contend, earlier Congresses avoided use of this highly attractive power, we would have reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist.</p>
<p id="fb923faa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government observes that statutes enacted by the first Congresses required state courts to record applications for citizenship, to transmit abstracts of citizenship applications and other naturalization records to the Secretary of State, and to register aliens seeking naturalization and issue certificates of registry. It may well be, however, that these requirements applied only in States that authorized their courts to conduct naturalization proceedings.</p>
<p id="fb923fab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These early laws establish, at most, that the Constitution was originally understood to permit imposition of an obligation on state judges to enforce federal prescriptions, insofar as those prescriptions related to matters appropriate for the judicial power. [W]e do not think the early statutes imposing obligations on state courts imply a power of Congress to impress the state executive into its service. Indeed, it can be argued that the numerousness of these statutes, contrasted with the utter lack of statutes imposing obligations on the States’ executive (notwithstanding the attractiveness of that course to Congress), suggests an assumed absence of such power.</p>
<p id="fb923fac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only do the enactments of the early Congresses, as far as we are aware, contain no evidence of an assumption that the Federal Government may command the States’ executive power in the absence of a particularized constitutional authorization, they contain some indication of precisely the opposite assumption. On September 23, 1789—the day before its proposal of the Bill of Rights, see 1 Annals of Congress 912-913—the First Congress enacted a law aimed at obtaining state assistance of the most rudimentary and necessary sort for the enforcement of the new Government’s laws: the holding of federal prisoners in state jails at federal expense. Significantly, the law issued not a command to the States’ executive, but a recommendation to their legislatures. Moreover, when Georgia refused to comply with the request, Congress’s only reaction was a law authorizing the marshal in any State that failed to comply with the Recommendation of September 23, 1789, to rent a temporary jail until provision for a permanent one could be made.</p>
<p id="fb923fad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To complete the historical record, we must note that there is not only an absence of executive-commandeering statutes in the early Congresses, but there <span title="228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-228">p. 228</span>is an absence of them in our later history as well, at least until very recent years. The Government points to a number of federal statutes enacted within the past few decades that require the participation of state or local officials in implementing federal regulatory schemes. Some of these are connected to federal funding measures, and can perhaps be more accurately described as conditions upon the grant of federal funding than as mandates to the States; others, which require only the provision of information to the Federal Government, do not involve the precise issue before us here, which is the forced participation of the States’ executive in the actual administration of a federal program. For deciding the issue before us here, they are of little relevance. Even assuming they represent assertion of the very same congressional power challenged here, they are of such recent vintage that they are no more probative than the statute before us of a constitutional tradition that lends meaning to the text.</p>

<p id="fb923fb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is incontestible that the Constitution established a system of “dual sovereignty.” Gregory v. Ashcroft (1991). Although the States surrendered many of their powers to the new Federal Government, they retained “a residuary and inviolable sovereignty,” The Federalist No. 39 (J. Madison). This is reflected throughout the Constitution’s text. Residual state sovereignty was also implicit, of course, in the Constitution’s conferral upon Congress of not all governmental powers, but only discrete, enumerated ones, Art. I, §8, which implication was rendered express by the Tenth Amendment’s assertion that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p id="fb923fb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The framers’ experience under the Articles of Confederation had persuaded them that using the States as the instruments of federal governance was both ineffectual and provocative of federal-state conflict. See The Federalist No. 15. Preservation of the States as independent political entities being the price of union, and “[t]he practicality of making laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as political bodies” having been, in Madison’s words, “exploded on all hands,” 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 9 (M. Farrand ed. 1911), the framers rejected the concept of a central government that would act upon and through the States, and instead designed a system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people—who were, in Hamilton’s words, “the only proper objects of government,” The Federalist No. 15, at 109.</p>
<p id="fb923fb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This separation of the two spheres is one of the Constitution’s structural protections of liberty. “Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the <span title="229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-229">p. 229</span>States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.”</p>

<p id="fb923fb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far discussed the effect that federal control of state officers would have upon the first element of the “double security” alluded to by Madison: the division of power between State and Federal Governments. It would also have an effect upon the second element: the separation and equilibration of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government itself. The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” Art. II, §3, personally and through officers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be appointed by the “Courts of Law” or by “the Heads of Departments” who are themselves presidential appointees), Art. II, §2. The Brady Act effectively transfers this responsibility to thousands of CLEOs in the 50 States, who are left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control (if indeed meaningful Presidential control is possible without the power to appoint and remove). The insistence of the framers upon unity in the Federal Executive—to insure both vigor and accountability—is well known. That unity would be shattered, and the power of the President would be subject to reduction, if Congress could act as effectively without the President as with him, by simply requiring state officers to execute its laws.</p>

<p id="fb9266c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and most conclusively in the present litigation, we turn to the prior jurisprudence of this Court. When we were at last confronted squarely with a federal statute that unambiguously required the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program, our decision should have come as no surprise. At issue in New York v. United States (1992) were the so-called “take title” provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, which required States either to enact legislation providing for the disposal of radioactive waste generated within their borders, or to take title to, and possession of the waste. We concluded that Congress could constitutionally require the States to do neither. “The Federal Government,” we held, “may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”</p>
<p id="fb9266c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government contends that New York is distinguishable on the following ground: unlike the “take title” provisions invalidated there, the background-check provision of the Brady Act does not require state legislative or executive officials to make policy, but instead issues a final directive to state CLEOs.</p>
<p id="fb9266c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s distinction between “making” law and merely “enforcing” it, between “policymaking” and mere “implementation,” is an interesting one. Executive action that has utterly no policymaking component is rare, particularly at an executive level as high as a jurisdiction’s chief law-enforcement officer. Is it really true that there is no policymaking involved in deciding, for example, what “reasonable efforts” shall be expended to conduct a background check?</p>
<p id="fb9266ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming, moreover, that the Brady Act leaves no “policymaking” discretion with the States, we fail to see how that improves rather than worsens the <span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>intrusion upon state sovereignty. Preservation of the States as independent and autonomous political entities is arguably less undermined by requiring them to make policy in certain fields than by “reduc[ing] [them] to puppets of a ventriloquist Congress.” It is an essential attribute of the States’ retained sovereignty that they remain independent and autonomous within their proper sphere of authority. It is no more compatible with this independence and autonomy that their officers be “dragooned” into administering federal law, than it would be compatible with the independence and autonomy of the United States that its officers be impressed into service for the execution of state laws.</p>
<p id="fb9266cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Government puts forward a cluster of arguments that can be grouped under the heading: “The Brady Act serves very important purposes, is most efficiently administered by CLEOs during the interim period, and places a minimal and only temporary burden upon state officers.” Assuming all the mentioned factors were true, they might be relevant if we were evaluating whether the incidental application to the States of a federal law of general applicability excessively interfered with the functioning of state governments. But where, as here, it is the whole object of the law to direct the functioning of the state executive, and hence to compromise the structural framework of dual sovereignty, such a “balancing” analysis is inappropriate. It is the very principle of separate state sovereignty that such a law offends, and no comparative assessment of the various interests can overcome that fundamental defect.</p>
<p id="fb9266cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We adhere to that principle today, and conclude categorically, as we concluded categorically in <i>New York</i>: “The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.” The mandatory obligation imposed on CLEOs to perform background checks on prospective handgun purchasers plainly runs afoul of that rule.</p>
<p id="fb9266cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We held in <i>New York</i> that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the State’s officers directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.</p>
<p id="fb9266ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb9266cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Congress exercises the powers delegated to it by the Constitution, it may impose affirmative obligations on executive and judicial officers of state and local governments as well as ordinary citizens. This conclusion is firmly supported by the text of the Constitution, the early history of the Nation, decisions of this Court, and a correct understanding of the basic structure of the Federal Government.</p>
<p id="fb9266d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases do not implicate the more difficult questions associated with congressional coercion of state legislatures addressed in New York v. United States (1992). Nor need we consider the wisdom of relying on local officials rather than federal agents to carry out aspects of a federal program, or even the question whether such officials may be required to perform a federal function on a permanent basis. The question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the <span title="231" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-231">p. 231</span>people of the entire Nation, may require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties during the interim needed for the development of a federal gun control program. It is remarkably similar to the question, heavily debated by the framers of the Constitution, whether the Congress could require state agents to collect federal taxes. Or the question whether Congress could impress state judges into federal service to entertain and decide cases that they would prefer to ignore.</p>
<p id="fb9266d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, since the ultimate issue is one of power, we must consider its implications in times of national emergency. Matters such as the enlistment of air raid wardens, the administration of a military draft, the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or perhaps the threat of an international terrorist, may require a national response before federal personnel can be made available to respond. If the Constitution empowers Congress and the President to make an appropriate response, is there anything in the Tenth Amendment, “in historical understanding and practice, in the structure of the Constitution, [or] in the jurisprudence of this Court,” that forbids the enlistment of state officers to make that response effective? More narrowly, what basis is there in any of those sources for concluding that it is the Members of this Court, rather than the elected representatives of the people, who should determine whether the Constitution contains the unwritten rule that the Court announces today?</p>
<p id="fb9266d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps today’s majority would suggest that no such emergency is presented by the facts of these cases. But such a suggestion is itself an expression of a policy judgment. And Congress’s view of the matter is quite different from that implied by the Court today.</p>
<p id="fb9266d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Brady Act was passed in response to what Congress described as an “epidemic of gun violence.” H. Rep. No. 103-344, 103rd Cong. 1st Sess. 1985. The Act’s legislative history notes that 15,377 Americans were murdered with firearms in 1992, and that 12,489 of these deaths were caused by handguns. Congress expressed special concern that “[t]he level of firearm violence in this country is, by far, the highest among developed nations.” The partial solution contained in the Brady Act, a mandatory background check before a handgun may be purchased, has met with remarkable success. Between 1994 and 1996, approximately 6,600 firearm sales each month to potentially dangerous persons were prevented by Brady Act checks; over 70% of the rejected purchasers were convicted or indicted felons. Whether or not the evaluation reflected in the enactment of the Brady Act is correct as to the extent of the danger and the efficacy of the legislation, the congressional decision surely warrants more respect than it is accorded in today’s unprecedented decision.</p>

<p id="fb928de5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text of the Constitution provides a sufficient basis for a correct disposition of this case. Article I, §8, grants the Congress the power to regulate commerce among the States. Putting to one side the revisionist views expressed by Justice Thomas, there can be no question that provision adequately supports the regulation of commerce in handguns effected by the Brady Act. Moreover, the additional grant of authority in that section of the Constitution “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers” is surely adequate to support the temporary enlistment of local police <span title="232" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-232">p. 232</span>officers in the process of identifying persons who should not be entrusted with the possession of handguns. In short, the affirmative delegation of power in Article I provides ample authority for the congressional enactment.</p>
<p id="fb928de6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the First Amendment, which prohibits the enactment of a category of laws that would otherwise be authorized by Article I, the Tenth Amendment imposes no restriction on the exercise of delegated powers. Using language that plainly refers only to powers that are “not” delegated to Congress, it provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The Amendment confirms the principle that the powers of the Federal Government are limited to those affirmatively granted by the Constitution, but it does not purport to limit the scope or the effectiveness of the exercise of powers that are delegated to Congress.</p>
<p id="fb928de7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is not a clause, sentence, or paragraph in the entire text of the Constitution of the United States that supports the proposition that a local police officer can ignore a command contained in a statute enacted by Congress pursuant to an express delegation of power enumerated in Article I.</p>

<p id="fb928de9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Articles of Confederation the National Government had the power to issue commands to the several sovereign states, but it had no authority to govern individuals directly. Thus, it raised an army and financed its operations by issuing requisitions to the constituent members of the Confederacy, rather than by creating federal agencies to draft soldiers or to impose taxes.</p>
<p id="fb928dea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That method of governing proved to be unacceptable, not because it demeaned the sovereign character of the several States, but rather because it was cumbersome and inefficient. The basic change in the character of the government that the framers conceived was designed to enhance the power of the national government, not to provide some new, unmentioned immunity for state officers.</p>
<p id="fb928deb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the historical materials strongly suggest that the Founders intended to enhance the capacity of the federal government by empowering it—as a part of the new authority to make demands directly on individual citizens—to act through local officials. Hamilton made clear that the new Constitution, “by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several States, will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each, in the execution of its laws.” The Federalist No. 27, at 180. Hamilton’s meaning was unambiguous; the federal government was to have the power to demand that local officials implement national policy programs.</p>
<p id="fb928dec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More specifically, during the debates concerning the ratification of the Constitution, it was assumed that state agents would act as tax collectors for the federal government. The Court’s response to this powerful historical evidence is weak. The majority suggests that “none of these statements necessarily implies . . . Congress could impose these responsibilities without the consent of the States.” No fair reading of these materials can justify such an interpretation. As Hamilton explained, the power of the government to act on “individual citizens”—including “employ[ing] the ordinary magistracy” of the States—was an <span title="233" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-233">p. 233</span>answer to the problems faced by a central government that could act only directly “upon the States in their political or collective capacities.” The Federalist, No. 27.</p>
<p id="fb928ded-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More importantly, the fact that Congress did elect to rely on state judges and the clerks of state courts to perform a variety of executive functions, is surely evidence of a contemporary understanding that their status as state officials did not immunize them from federal service. The majority’s description of these early statutes is both incomplete and at times misleading.</p>

<p id="fb928def-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s “structural” arguments are not sufficient to rebut that presumption. The fact that the framers intended to preserve the sovereignty of the several States simply does not speak to the question whether individual state employees may be required to perform federal obligations, such as registering young adults for the draft, creating state emergency response commissions designed to manage the release of hazardous substances, collecting and reporting data on underground storage tanks that may pose an environmental hazard, and reporting traffic fatalities, and missing children, to a federal agency.</p>
<p id="fb928df0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we explained in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985): “[T]he principal means chosen by the framers to ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the structure of the Federal Government itself. It is no novelty to observe that the composition of the Federal Government was designed in large part to protect the States from overreaching by Congress.” Given the fact that the Members of Congress are elected by the people of the several States, with each State receiving an equivalent number of Senators in order to ensure that even the smallest States have a powerful voice in the legislature, it is quite unrealistic to assume that they will ignore the sovereignty concerns of their constituents. It is far more reasonable to presume that their decisions to impose modest burdens on state officials from time to time reflect a considered judgment that the people in each of the States will benefit therefrom.</p>
<p id="fb928df1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent developments demonstrate that the political safeguards protecting Our Federalism are effective. The majority expresses special concern that were its rule not adopted the Federal Government would be able to avail itself of the services of state government officials “at no cost to itself.” But this specific problem of federal actions that have the effect of imposing so-called “unfunded mandates” on the States has been identified and meaningfully addressed by Congress in recent legislation. See Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, 109 Stat. 48.</p>
<p id="fb92b502-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there force to the assumption undergirding the Court’s entire opinion that if this trivial burden on state sovereignty is permissible, the entire structure of federalism will soon collapse. These cases do not involve any mandate to state legislatures to enact new rules. When legislative action, or even administrative rulemaking, is at issue, it may be appropriate for Congress either to pre-empt the State’s lawmaking power and fashion the federal rule itself, or to respect the State’s power to fashion its own rules. But this case, unlike any precedent in which the Court has held that Congress exceeded its powers, merely involves the imposition of modest duties on individual officers. The Court seems to accept the fact that Congress could require private persons, such as hospital executives or school administrators, to provide arms merchants with relevant information <span title="234" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-234">p. 234</span>about a prospective purchaser’s fitness to own a weapon; indeed, the Court does not disturb the conclusion that flows directly from our prior holdings that the burden on police officers would be permissible if a similar burden were also imposed on private parties with access to relevant data. A structural problem that vanishes when the statute affects private individuals as well as public officials is not much of a structural problem.</p>
<p id="fb92b503-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provision of the Brady Act that crosses the Court’s newly defined constitutional threshold is more comparable to a statute requiring local police officers to report the identity of missing children to the Crime Control Center of the Department of Justice than to an offensive federal command to a sovereign state. If Congress believes that such a statute will benefit the people of the Nation, and serve the interests of cooperative federalism better than an enlarged federal bureaucracy, we should respect both its policy judgment and its appraisal of its constitutional power.</p>

<p id="fb92b509-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb92b50a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA or Act) regulates the disclosure of personal information contained in the records of state motor vehicle departments (DMVs). We hold that in enacting this statute Congress did not run afoul of the federalism principles enunciated in New York v. United States (1992) and Printz v. United States (1997).</p>
<p id="fb92b50b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The DPPA regulates the disclosure and resale of personal information contained in the records of state DMVs. State DMVs require drivers and automobile owners to provide personal information, which may include a person’s name, address, telephone number, vehicle description, Social Security number, medical information, and photograph, as a condition of obtaining a driver’s license or registering an automobile. Congress found that many States, in turn, sell this personal information to individuals and businesses. These sales generate significant revenues for the States.</p>
<p id="fb92b50c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The DPPA establishes a regulatory scheme that restricts the States’ ability to disclose a driver’s personal information without the driver’s consent. The DPPA generally prohibits any state DMV, or officer, employee, or contractor thereof, from “knowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to any person or entity personal information about any individual obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record.” The DPPA defines “personal information” as any information “that identifies an individual, including an individual’s photograph, Social Security number, driver identification number, name, address (but not the 5-digit zip code), telephone number, and medical or disability information,” but not including “information on vehicular accidents, driving violations, and driver’s status.”</p>
<p id="fb92b50d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The DPPA’s provisions do not apply solely to States. The Act also regulates the resale and redisclosure of drivers’ personal information by private persons who have obtained that information from a state DMV. The DPPA establishes several penalties to be imposed on States and private actors that fail to comply with its requirements.</p>
<p id="fb92b50e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="235" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-235">p. 235</span>South Carolina law conflicts with the DPPA’s provisions. Under that law, the information contained in the State’s DMV records is available to any person or entity that fills out a form listing the requester’s name and address and stating that the information will not be used for telephone solicitation.</p>
<p id="fb92b50f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the DPPA’s enactment, South Carolina and its Attorney General, respondent Condon, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleging that the DPPA violates the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb92dc20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We of course begin with the time-honored presumption that the DPPA is a “constitutional exercise of legislative power.” The United States asserts that the DPPA is a proper exercise of Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. The United States bases its Commerce Clause argument on the fact that the personal, identifying information that the DPPA regulates is a “thin[g] in interstate commerce,” and that the sale or release of that information in interstate commerce is therefore a proper subject of congressional regulation. United States v. Lopez (1995). We agree with the United States’ contention. The motor vehicle information which the States have historically sold is used by insurers, manufacturers, direct marketers, and others engaged in interstate commerce to contact drivers with customized solicitations. The information is also used in the stream of interstate commerce by various public and private entities for matters related to interstate motoring. Because drivers’ information is, in this context, an article of commerce, its sale or release into the interstate stream of business is sufficient to support congressional regulation.</p>
<p id="fb92dc21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the fact that drivers’ personal information is, in the context of this case, an article in interstate commerce does not conclusively resolve the constitutionality of the DPPA. In <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i>, we held federal statutes invalid, not because Congress lacked legislative authority over the subject matter, but because those statutes violated the principles of federalism contained in the Tenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb92dc22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">South Carolina contends that the DPPA violates the Tenth Amendment because it “thrusts upon the States all of the day-to-day responsibility for administering its complex provisions,” and thereby makes “state officials the unwilling implementors of federal policy.” South Carolina emphasizes that the DPPA requires the State’s employees to learn and apply the Act’s substantive restrictions, which are summarized above, and notes that these activities will consume the employees’ time and thus the State’s resources. South Carolina further notes that the DPPA’s penalty provisions hang over the States as a potential punishment should they fail to comply with the Act.</p>
<p id="fb92dc23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with South Carolina’s assertion that the DPPA’s provisions will require time and effort on the part of state employees, but reject the State’s argument that the DPPA violates the principles laid down in either <i>New York</i> or <i>Printz</i>. We think, instead, that this case is governed by our decision in South Carolina v. Baker (1988). In <i>Baker</i>, we upheld a statute that prohibited States from issuing unregistered bonds because the law “regulate[d] state activities,” rather than “seek[ing] to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.” We further noted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb92dc24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such “commandeering” is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity. Any federal regulation demands compliance. That a State wishing to engage in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative <span title="236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-236">p. 236</span>action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.</p>
</div>
<p id="fb92dc25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the statute at issue in <i>Baker</i>, the DPPA does not require the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens. The DPPA regulates the States as the owners of databases. It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it does not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals. We accordingly conclude that the DPPA is consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i>.</p>
<p id="fb92dc26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a final matter, we turn to South Carolina’s argument that the DPPA is unconstitutional because it regulates the States exclusively. The essence of South Carolina’s argument is that Congress may only regulate the States by means of “generally applicable” laws, or laws that apply to individuals as well as States. But we need not address the question whether general applicability is a constitutional requirement for federal regulation of the States, because the DPPA is generally applicable. The DPPA regulates the universe of entities that participate as suppliers to the market for motor vehicle information—the States as initial suppliers of the information in interstate commerce and private resellers or redisclosers of that information in commerce.</p>

<p id="fb93033d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of New Jersey wants to legalize sports gambling at casinos and horseracing tracks, but a federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, generally makes it unlawful for a State to “authorize” sports gambling schemes. We must decide whether this provision is compatible with the system of “dual sovereignty” embodied in the Constitution.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fb93033f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sports gambling has long had strong opposition. Opponents argue that it is particularly addictive and especially attractive to young people with a strong interest in sports, and in the past gamblers corrupted and seriously damaged the reputation of professional and amateur sports. Apprehensive about the potential effects of sports gambling, professional sports leagues and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) long opposed legalization.</p>
<p id="fb930340-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the 1990s, there were signs that the trend that had brought about the legalization of many other forms of gambling might extend to sports gambling, and this sparked federal efforts to stem the tide. Opponents of sports gambling turned to the legislation now before us, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). PASPA’s proponents argued that it would protect young people, and one of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a former college and professional basketball star, stressed that the law was needed to safeguard the integrity of sports.</p>
<p id="fb930341-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-237">p. 237</span>PASPA’s most important provision, part of which is directly at issue in these cases, makes it “unlawful” for a State or any of its subdivisions “to sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law or compact . . . a lottery, sweepstakes, or other betting, gambling, or wagering scheme based . . . on” competitive sporting events. §3702(1). In parallel, §3702(2) makes it “unlawful” for “a person to sponsor, operate, advertise, or promote” those same gambling schemes—but only if this is done ”pursuant to the law or compact of a governmental entity.” PASPA does not make sports gambling a federal crime (and thus was not anticipated to impose a significant law enforcement burden on the Federal Government). Instead, PASPA allows the Attorney General, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations.</p>
<p id="fb930342-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of PASPA’s adoption, a few jurisdictions allowed some form of sports gambling. In Nevada, sports gambling was legal in casinos, and three States hosted sports lotteries or allowed sports pools. PASPA contains “grand-father” provisions allowing these activities to continue.  Another provision gave New Jersey the option of legalizing sports gambling in Atlantic City—provided that it did so within one year of the law’s effective date.</p>
<p id="fb930343-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Jersey did not take advantage of this special option, but by 2011, with Atlantic City facing stiff competition, the State had a change of heart. New Jersey voters approved an amendment to the State Constitution making it lawful for the legislature to authorize sports gambling, and in 2012 the legislature enacted a law doing just that.</p>
<p id="fb930344-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 2012 Act quickly came under attack. The major professional sports leagues and the NCAA brought an action in federal court against the New Jersey Governor and other state officials (hereinafter New Jersey), seeking to enjoin the new law on the ground that it violated PASPA. [The New Jersey law was struck down.]</p>
<p id="fb930345-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he New Jersey Legislature enacted the law now before us. The 2014 Act declares that it is not to be interpreted as causing the State to authorize, license, sponsor, operate, advertise, or promote sports gambling. Instead, it is framed as a repealer. Specifically, it repeals the provisions of state law prohibiting sports gambling insofar as they concerned the “placement and acceptance of wagers” on sporting events by persons 21 years of age or older at a horseracing track or a casino or gambling house in Atlantic City. The new law also specified that the repeal was effective only as to wagers on sporting events not involving a New Jersey college team or a collegiate event taking place in the State.</p>
<p id="fb930346-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Predictably, the same plaintiffs promptly commenced a new action in federal court. They won in the District Court, and the case was eventually heard by the Third Circuit sitting en banc.

<p id="fb930348-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before considering the constitutionality of the PASPA provision prohibiting States from “author[izing]” sports gambling, we first examine its meaning. The parties advance dueling interpretations, and this dispute has an important bearing on the constitutional issue that we must decide. Neither respondents nor the United States, appearing as an <i>amicus</i> in support of respondents, contends <span title="238" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-238">p. 238</span>that the provision at issue would be constitutional if petitioners’ interpretation is correct. Indeed, the United States expressly concedes that the provision is unconstitutional if it means what petitioners claim.</p>
<p id="fb930349-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners argue that the anti-authorization provision requires States to maintain their existing laws against sports gambling without alteration. One of the accepted meanings of the term “authorize,” they point out, is “permit.” They therefore contend that any state law that has the effect of permitting sports gambling, including a law totally or partially repealing a prior prohibition, amounts to an authorization.</p>
<p id="fb932a5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents interpret the provision more narrowly. They claim that the <i>primary</i> definition of “authorize” requires affirmative action. To authorize, they maintain, means “‘[t]o empower; to give a right or authority to act; to endow with authority.’” And this, they say, is precisely what the 2014 Act does: It empowers a defined group of entities, and it endows them with the authority to conduct sports gambling operations. Respondents do not take the position that PASPA bans all modifications of old laws against sports gambling, but just how far they think a modification could go is not clear.</p>
<p id="fb932a5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, petitioners’ interpretation is correct: When a State completely or partially repeals old laws banning sports gambling, it “authorize[s]” that activity. This is clear when the state-law landscape at the time of PASPA’s enactment is taken into account. At that time, all forms of sports gambling were illegal in the great majority of States, and in that context, the competing definitions offered by the parties lead to the same conclusion. The repeal of a state law banning sports gambling not only “permits” sports gambling (petitioners’ favored definition); it also gives those now free to conduct a sports betting operation the “right or authority to act”; it “empowers” them (respondents’ and the United States’s definition).</p>
<p id="fb932a5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of state “authorization” makes sense only against a backdrop of prohibition or regulation. A State is not regarded as authorizing everything that it does not prohibit or regulate. No one would use the term in that way. For example, no one would say that a State “authorizes” its residents to brush their teeth or eat apples or sing in the shower. We commonly speak of state authorization only if the activity in question would otherwise be restricted.</p>

<p id="fb932a5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The anticommandeering doctrine may sound arcane, but it is simply the expression of a fundamental structural decision incorporated into the Constitution, <i>i.e.,</i> the decision to withhold from Congress the power to issue orders directly to the States. When the original States declared their independence, they claimed the powers inherent in sovereignty—in the words of the Declaration of Independence, the authority “to do all . . . Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.” The Constitution limited but did not abolish the sovereign powers of the States, which retained “a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.” Thus, both the Federal Government and the States wield sovereign powers, and that is why our system of government is said to be one of “dual sovereignty.”</p>
<p id="fb932a5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative powers granted to Congress are sizable, but they are not unlimited. The Constitution confers on Congress not plenary legislative power but only certain enumerated powers. Therefore, all other legislative power is reserved for the States, as the Tenth Amendment confirms. And conspicuously <span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-239">p. 239</span>absent from the list of powers given to Congress is the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States. The anticommandeering doctrine simply represents the recognition of this limit on congressional authority.</p>
<p id="fb932a60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the anticommandeering principle is simple and basic, it did not emerge in our cases until relatively recently, when Congress attempted in a few isolated instances to extend its authority in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p id="fb932a61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our opinions in <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i> explained why adherence to the anticommandeering principle is important. Without attempting a complete survey, we mention several reasons that are significant here. First, the rule serves as “one of the Constitution’s structural protections of liberty.” “The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty of States for the benefit of the States or state governments as abstract political entities.” “To the contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals.” “‘[A] healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government [reduces] the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.’”</p>
<p id="fb932a62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the anticommandeering rule promotes political accountability. When Congress itself regulates, the responsibility for the benefits and burdens of the regulation is apparent. Voters who like or dislike the effects of the regulation know who to credit or blame. By contrast, if a State imposes regulations only because it has been commanded to do so by Congress, responsibility is blurred.</p>
<p id="fb932a63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the anticommandeering principle prevents Congress from shifting the costs of regulation to the States. If Congress enacts a law and requires enforcement by the Executive Branch, it must appropriate the funds needed to administer the program. It is pressured to weigh the expected benefits of the program against its costs. But if Congress can compel the States to enact and enforce its program, Congress need not engage in any such analysis.</p>

<p id="fb932a65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The PASPA provision at issue here—prohibiting state authorization of sports gambling—violates the anticommandeering rule. That provision unequivocally dictates what a state legislature may and may not do. And this is true under either our interpretation or that advocated by respondents and the United States. In either event, state legislatures are put under the direct control of Congress. It is as if federal officers were installed in state legislative chambers and were armed with the authority to stop legislators from voting on any offending proposals. A more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine.</p>
<p id="fb935176-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither respondents nor the United States contends that Congress can compel a State to enact legislation, but they say that prohibiting a State from enacting new laws is another matter.</p>
<p id="fb935177-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This distinction is empty. It was a matter of happenstance that the laws challenged in <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i> commanded “affirmative” action as opposed to imposing a prohibition. The basic principle—that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures—applies in either event.</p>
</div>

<p id="fb935179-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents and the United States defend the anti-authorization prohibition on the ground that it constitutes a valid preemption provision, but it is no such <span title="240" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-240">p. 240</span>thing. Preemption is based on the Supremacy Clause, and that Clause is not an independent grant of legislative power to Congress. Instead, it simply provides “a rule of decision.”  It specifies that federal law is supreme in case of a conflict with state law. Therefore, in order for the PASPA provision to preempt state law, it must satisfy two requirements. First, it must represent the exercise of a power conferred on Congress by the Constitution; pointing to the Supremacy Clause will not do. Second, since the Constitution “confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States,” the PASPA provision at issue must be best read as one that regulates private actors.</p>
<p id="fb93517a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, regardless of the language sometimes used by Congress and this Court, every form of preemption is based on a federal law that regulates the conduct of private actors, not the States. Once this is understood, it is clear that the PASPA provision prohibiting state authorization of sports gambling is not a preemption provision because there is no way in which this provision can be understood as a regulation of private actors. It certainly does not confer any federal rights on private actors interested in conducting sports gambling operations. (It does not give them a federal right to engage in sports gambling.) Nor does it impose any federal restrictions on private actors. If a private citizen or company started a sports gambling operation, either with or without state authorization, §3702(1) would not be violated and would not provide any ground for a civil action by the Attorney General or any other party. Thus, there is simply no way to understand the provision prohibiting state authorization as anything other than a direct command to the States. And that is exactly what the anticommandeering rule does not allow.</p>
<p id="fb93517b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legalization of sports gambling is a controversial subject. Supporters argue that legalization will produce revenue for the States and critically weaken illegal sports betting operations, which are often run by organized crime. Opponents contend that legalizing sports gambling will hook the young on gambling, encourage people of modest means to squander their savings and earnings, and corrupt professional and college sports.</p>
<p id="fb93517c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not. PASPA “regulate [s] state governments’ regulation” of their citizens. The Constitution gives Congress no such power.</p>

<p id="fb935182-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A basic question concerns the purposes for which Congress may tax and spend. Is Congress limited to taxing and spending only to carry out other powers specifically enumerated in Article I, or does Congress have broad authority to tax and spend for the general welfare? The Court adopted the latter, much more expansive view in United States v. Butler, below.</p>
<p id="fb937893-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reading <i>Butler</i>, it is important to distinguish two issues: the scope of Congress’s taxing and spending power, and whether the Tenth Amendment is a limit on it. <i>Butler</i>’s holding as to the former remains good law, but its ruling as to the Tenth Amendment is no longer followed.</p>

<p id="fb93789a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case we must determine whether certain provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 1933, conflict with the Federal Constitution. [The Agricultural Adjustment Act declared that because of a crisis in agricultural production, the Secretary of Agriculture, among other powers, could set limits on production of certain crops and impose taxes on production in excess of these limits. The Act also authorized grants to farmers to control production and thus regulate prices.]</p>
<p id="fb93789b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There should be no misunderstanding as to the function of this court in such a case. It is sometimes said that the court assumes a power to overrule or control the action of the people’s representatives. This is a misconception. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land ordained and established by the people. All legislation must conform to the principles it lays down. When an act of Congress is appropriately challenged in the courts as not conforming to the constitutional mandate, the judicial branch of the government has only one duty; to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. All the court does, or can do, is to announce its considered judgment upon the question.</p>
<p id="fb93789c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article 1, §8, of the Constitution, vests sundry powers in the Congress. The clause thought to authorize the legislation, the first, confers upon the Congress power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” It is not contended that this provision grants power to regulate agricultural production upon the theory that such legislation would promote the general welfare. The government concedes that the phrase “to provide for the general welfare” qualifies the power “to lay and collect taxes.”</p>
<p id="fb93789d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Congress is expressly empowered to lay taxes to provide for the general welfare. Since the foundation of the nation, sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to the true interpretation of the phrase. Madison asserted it amounted to no more than a reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section; that, as the United States is a government of limited and enumerated powers, the grant of power to tax and spend for the general national welfare must be confined to the enumerated legislative fields committed to the Congress. In this view the phrase is mere tautology, for <span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>taxation and appropriation are or may be necessary incidents of the exercise of any of the enumerated legislative powers. Hamilton, on the other hand, maintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated and is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them, and Congress consequently has a substantive power to tax and to appropriate, limited only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide for the general welfare of the United States. Each contention has had the support of those whose views are entitled to weight. This court has noticed the question, but has never found it necessary to decide which is the true construction. Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries, espouses the Hamiltonian position. We shall not review the writings of public men and commentators or discuss the legislative practice. Study of all these leads us to conclude that the reading advocated by Mr. Justice Story is the correct one. While, therefore, the power to tax is not unlimited, its confines are set in the clause which confers it, and not in those of section 8 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress. It results that the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb93789e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the adoption of the broader construction leaves the power to spend subject to limitations. We are not now required to ascertain the scope of the phrase “general welfare of the United States” or to determine whether an appropriation in aid of agriculture falls within it. Wholly apart from that question, another principle embedded in our Constitution prohibits the enforcement of the Agricultural [A]djustment Act. The act invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.</p>
<p id="fb939faf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has no power to enforce its commands on the farmer to the ends sought by the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It must follow that it may not indirectly accomplish those ends by taxing and spending to purchase compliance. The Constitution and the entire plan of our government negative any such use of the power to tax and to spend as the act undertakes to authorize. It does not help to declare that local conditions throughout the nation have created a situation of national concern; for this is but to say that whenever there is a widespread similarity of local conditions, Congress may ignore constitutional limitations upon its own powers and usurp those reserved to the states. If, in lieu of compulsory regulation of subjects within the states’ reserved jurisdiction, which is prohibited, the Congress could invoke the taxing and spending power as a means to accomplish the same end, clause 1 of section 8 of article 1 would become the instrument for total subversion of the governmental powers reserved to the individual states.</p>
<p id="fb939fb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since, as we have pointed out, there was no power in the Congress to impose the contested exaction, it could not lawfully ratify or confirm what an executive officer had done in that regard.</p>

<p id="fb939fb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the argument from history: Doubtless there were many excises in colonial days and later that were associated, more or less intimately, with the enjoyment or the use of property. This would not prove, even if no others were then known, that the forms then accepted were not subject to enlargement. But in truth other excises were known, and known since early times.</p>
<p id="fb939fb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical prop failing, the prop or fancied prop of principle remains. We learn that employment for lawful gain is a “natural” or “inherent” or “inalienable” right, and not a “privilege” at all. But natural rights, so called, are as much subject to taxation as rights of less importance. It extends to vocations or activities pursued as of common right. What the individual does in the operation of a business is amenable to taxation just as much as what he owns, at all events if the classification is not tyrannical or arbitrary.</p>
<p id="fb939fb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject-matter of taxation open to the power of the Congress is as comprehensive as that open to the power of the states, though the method of apportionment may at times be different. “The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.” Article 1, §8. If the tax is a direct one, it shall be apportioned according to the census or enumeration. If it is a duty, impost, or excise, it shall be uniform throughout the United States. Together, these classes include every form of tax appropriate to sovereignty. The statute books of the states are strewn with illustrations of taxes laid on occupations pursued of common right. We find no basis for a holding that the power in that regard which belongs by accepted practice to the Legislatures of the states, has been denied by the Constitution to the Congress of the nation.</p>

<p id="fb93c6d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The charges were brought under 18 U.S.C. §666(a)(2), which imposes federal criminal penalties on anyone who “corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything of value to any person, with intent to influence or reward an agent of an organization or of a State, local or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof, in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.” For criminal liability to lie, the statute requires that “the organization, government, or agency receiv[e], in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.” In 2001, the City Council of Minneapolis administered about $29 million in federal funds paid to the city, and in the same period, the MCDA received some $23 million of federal money.</p>

<p id="fb93ede7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sabri raises what he calls a facial challenge to §666(a)(2): the law can never be applied constitutionally because it fails to require proof of any connection between a bribe or kickback and some federal money. It is fatal, as he sees it, that the statute does not make the link an element of the crime, to be charged in the indictment and demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p id="fb93ede8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We can readily dispose of this position that, to qualify as a valid exercise of Article I power, the statute must require proof of connection with federal money as an element of the offense. We simply do not presume the unconstitutionality of federal criminal statutes lacking explicit provision of a jurisdictional hook, and there is no occasion even to consider the need for such a requirement where there is no reason to suspect that enforcement of a criminal statute would extend beyond a legitimate interest cognizable under Article I, §8.</p>
<p id="fb93ede9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to appropriate federal monies to promote the general welfare, Art. I, §8, cl. 1, and it has corresponding authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, to see to it that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for the <span title="245" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-245">p. 245</span>general welfare, and not frittered away in graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned off or corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding value for dollars. See generally McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). Congress does not have to sit by and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local and state improbity. Section 666(a)(2) addresses the problem at the sources of bribes, by rational means, to safeguard the integrity of the state, local, and tribal recipients of federal dollars.</p>
<p id="fb93edea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, just as Sabri says, that not every bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments covered by §666(b) will be traceably skimmed from specific federal payments, or show up in the guise of a quid pro quo for some dereliction in spending a federal grant. But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the reason that corruption does not have to be that limited to affect the federal interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value. Liquidity is not a financial term for nothing; money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there. And officials are not any the less threatening to the objects behind federal spending just because they may accept general retainers. It is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, such as that provided here, and on a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and cigars.</p>

<p id="fb93eded-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One important issue concerning the spending power concerns the ability of Congress to place conditions on grants to state and local governments. The Court has held that Congress may place strings on such grants, as long as the conditions are expressly stated and as long as they have some relationship to the purpose of the spending program.</p>
<p id="fb93edee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127 (1947), the Court upheld a provision of the federal Hatch Act which granted federal funds to state governments on the condition that the states adopt civil service systems and limit the political activities of many categories of government workers. The Court explained that Congress has broad power to set conditions for the receipt of federal funds even as to areas that Congress might otherwise not be able to regulate. The Court stated: “While the United States is not concerned with, and has no power to regulate, local political activities as such of state officials, it does have power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to states shall be disbursed.”</p>
<p id="fb93edef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In South Dakota v. Dole, the Court upheld conditions on grants to state and local governments but also explained the conditions that must be met.</p>

<p id="fb941505-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb941506-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>Petitioner South Dakota permits persons 19 years of age or older to purchase beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol. In 1984 Congress enacted 23 U.S.C. §158, which directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of federal highway funds otherwise allocable from States “in which the purchase or public possession . . . of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful.” The State sued in United States District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that §158 violates the constitutional limitations on congressional exercise of the spending power and violates the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb941507-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution empowers Congress to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Incident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the power “to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.”</p>
<p id="fb941508-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The spending power is of course not unlimited, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman (1981), but is instead subject to several general restrictions articulated in our cases. The first of these limitations is derived from the language of the Constitution itself: the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of “the general welfare.” In considering whether a particular expenditure is intended to serve general public purposes, courts should defer substantially to the judgment of Congress. Second, we have required that if Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt of federal funds, it “must do so unambiguously . . . , enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.” Third, our cases have suggested (without significant elaboration) that conditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated “to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.” Finally, we have noted that other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds.</p>
<p id="fb941509-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">South Dakota does not seriously claim that §158 is inconsistent with any of the first three restrictions mentioned above. We can readily conclude that the provision is designed to serve the general welfare. The conditions upon which States receive the funds, moreover, could not be more clearly stated by Congress. Indeed, the condition imposed by Congress is directly related to one of the main purposes for which highway funds are expended—safe interstate travel.</p>
<p id="fb94150a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have also held that a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants. Our decisions have recognized that in some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which “pressure turns into compulsion.” Here, however, Congress has directed only that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds. Petitioner contends that the coercive nature of this program is evident from the degree of success it has achieved. We cannot conclude, however, that a conditional grant of federal money of this sort is unconstitutional simply by reason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.</p>
<p id="fb94150b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we consider, for a moment, that all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5% of <span title="247" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-247">p. 247</span>the funds otherwise obtainable under specified highway grant programs, the argument as to coercion is shown to be more rhetoric than fact.</p>
<p id="fb94150c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb94150d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with Justice O’Connor that regulation of the minimum age of purchasers of liquor falls squarely within the ambit of those powers reserved to the States by the Twenty-first Amendment. Since States possess this constitutional power, Congress cannot condition a federal grant in a manner that abridges this right. The Amendment, itself, strikes the proper balance between federal and state authority. I therefore dissent.</p>
<p id="fb94150e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb94150f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today upholds the National Minimum Drinking Age Amendment, as a valid exercise of the spending power conferred by Article I, §8. But §158 is not a condition on spending reasonably related to the expenditure of federal funds and cannot be justified on that ground. Rather, it is an attempt to regulate the sale of liquor, an attempt that lies outside Congress’s power to regulate commerce because it falls within the ambit of §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb941510-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My disagreement with the Court is relatively narrow on the spending power issue: it is a disagreement about the application of a principle rather than a disagreement on the principle itself. I agree with the Court that Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds to further “the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.”</p>
<p id="fb941511-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court’s application of the requirement that the condition imposed be reasonably related to the purpose for which the funds are expended is cursory and unconvincing. We have repeatedly said that Congress may condition grants under the spending power only in ways reasonably related to the purpose of the federal program. In my view, establishment of a minimum drinking age of 21 is not sufficiently related to interstate highway construction to justify so conditioning funds appropriated for that purpose.</p>
<p id="fb943c22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Congress appropriates money to build a highway, it is entitled to insist that the highway be a safe one. But it is not entitled to insist as a condition of the use of highway funds that the State impose or change regulations in other areas of the State’s social and economic life because of an attenuated or tangential relationship to highway use or safety. Indeed, if the rule were otherwise, the Congress could effectively regulate almost any area of a State’s social, political, or economic life on the theory that use of the interstate transportation system is somehow enhanced. If, for example, the United States were to condition highway moneys upon moving the state capital, I suppose it might argue that interstate transportation is facilitated by locating local governments in places easily accessible to interstate highways—or, conversely, that highways might become overburdened if they had to carry traffic to and from the state capital. In my mind, such a relationship is hardly more attenuated than the one which the Court finds supports, §158.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fb943c23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the majority and the dissent in South Dakota v. Dole discuss Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981), in which the Supreme Court held that Congress may place strings on grants to state and local <span title="248" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-248">p. 248</span>governments as long as the conditions are expressly stated. The Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 created a federal grant program for state governments to provide for better care for the developmentally disabled. The act included a “bill of rights” for the developmentally disabled. The Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a facility run by the State of Pennsylvania, was sued for violating the bill of rights contained in the act.</p>
<p id="fb943c24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court ruled in favor of the state, holding that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys it must do so unambiguously.” The Court explained that conditions must be clearly stated so that states will know the consequences of their choosing to take federal funds. The Court concluded that the act failed to require that states meet the bill of rights as a condition for accepting federal money.</p>
<p id="fb943c25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, presented above, the Court for the first time found conditions on federal spending to be unconstitutional as unduly coercive.</p>

<p id="fb943c28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Civil War, three extremely important amendments were added to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment, adopted in 1865, prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime, and also provides in §2, “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” The Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868, provides that all persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens and that no state can abridge the privileges or immunities of such citizens; nor may states deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or deny any person of equal protection of the laws. Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment states, “[T]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”</p>
<p id="fb943c29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifteenth Amendment declares that “[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Section 2 again provides that Congress has the power to enforce it by appropriate legislation.</p>
<p id="fb943c2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three Reconstruction-era amendments thus contain provisions that empower Congress to enact civil rights legislation. Two major questions arise concerning the scope of this power. First, may Congress regulate private conduct under this authority, or is Congress limited to regulating only government actions? Second, what is the scope of Congress’s power under these amendments?</p>

<p id="fb943c2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the Court held that Congress, pursuant to §2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, <span title="249" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-249">p. 249</span>may regulate only state and local government actions, not private conduct.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114C1_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N114C1_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span> The Civil Rights Act of 1875 provided that all persons were “entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, public conveyances, on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude.” In other words, the law broadly prohibited private racial discrimination by hotels, restaurants, transportation, and other public accommodations.</p>
<p id="fb94633f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By an eight-to-one decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and adopted a restrictive view as to the power of Congress to use these provisions to regulate private behavior. As to the Thirteenth Amendment, the Court recognized that it applies to private conduct; it prohibits people from being or owning slaves. The Court, however, said that Congress’s power was limited to ensuring an end to slavery; Congress could not use this power to eliminate discrimination. The Court explained that “[i]t would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business.” Indeed, the Court stated that Congress could abolish “all badges and incidents of slavery,” but it could not use its power under the Thirteenth Amendment to “adjust what may be called the social rights of men and races in the community.”</p>
<p id="fb946340-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, writing less than 20 years after the Civil War, said that slavery was a thing of the past and that there was little need for civil rights legislation to protect blacks. Justice Bradley, writing for the Court, stated, “When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that state, there must be some stage in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws, and when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected in the ordinary modes by which other men’s rights are protected.”</p>
<p id="fb946341-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also held that Congress lacked the authority to enact the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. In fact, the Court broadly declared that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to government action and that therefore it cannot be used by Congress to regulate private behavior. The Court stated that “the fourteenth amendment is prohibitory . . . upon the states. [Individual] invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment.” The Court made it clear that Congress’s authority was only over state and local governments and their officials, not over private conduct: “It does not authorize Congress to create a code of municipal law for the regulation of private rights; but to provide modes of redress against the operation of State laws, and the actions of State officers.”</p>
<p id="fb946342-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now, however, it is well established that Congress, pursuant to §2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, may prohibit private racial discrimination. In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), the Court held that Congress could prohibit private discrimination in selling and leasing property. The case involved <span title="250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-250">p. 250</span>a private real estate developer who refused to sell housing or land to African Americans. An African American couple sued under 42 U.S.C. §1982, which provides that all citizens have “the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property.”</p>
<p id="fb946343-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held that §1982 applies to prohibit private discrimination and that Congress had the authority under the Thirteenth Amendment to adopt the law. The Court said that Congress has broad legislative power under the Thirteenth Amendment: “Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.”</p>
<p id="fb946344-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976), the Court held that 42 U.S.C. §1981 applies to prohibit discrimination in private contracting and that this is within the scope of Congress’s power under §2 of the Thirteenth Amendment. Section 1981 provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens.” <i>Runyon</i> raised the question of whether §1981 prohibits private schools from excluding qualified African American children solely because of their race.</p>
<p id="fb946345-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court saw no basis for distinguishing Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. and concluded “that §1981, like §1982, reaches private conduct.” The Court unanimously reaffirmed this conclusion in 1989 in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164 (1989).</p>
<p id="fb946346-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Supreme Court subsequently reaffirmed that Congress cannot regulate private behavior under the Fourteenth Amendment. In United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966), five Justices, although not in a single opinion, concluded that Congress may outlaw private discrimination pursuant to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Guest</i> involved the federal law that makes it a crime for two or more persons to go “in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege.” 18 U.S.C. §241. The Court held that interference with the use of facilities in interstate commerce violated the law, whether or not motivated by a racial animus.</p>
<p id="fb946347-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority opinion did not reach the question of whether Congress could regulate private conduct under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, six of the justices—three in a concurring opinion and three in a dissenting opinion—expressed the view that Congress could prohibit private discrimination under its §5 powers. Justice Tom Clark, in a concurring opinion joined by Justices Hugo Black and Abe Fortas, said that “the specific language of §5 empowers the Congress to enact laws punishing all conspiracies—with or without state action—that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights.” Likewise, Justice William Brennan in an opinion that concurred in part and dissented in part, and that was joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Douglas, concluded that Congress may prohibit private discrimination pursuant to §5. However, the Supreme Court later overruled <i>Guest</i> and held that Congress cannot regulate private behavior under §5.</p><span title="251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-251">p. 251</span>

The issue is the constitutionality of the civil damages provision of the Violence Against Women Act. The case involves a woman who, while a freshman at Virginia Tech University, was allegedly raped by football players. She sued under the civil remedies provision of the act. In the first part of the majority opinion, the Court held that it exceeded the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause authority.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1151A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1151A_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">32</a></span> In the alternative, the government argued that the law was constitutional as an exercise of Congress’s power under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.]</p>
<p id="fb948a5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>
<p id="fb948a60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we conclude that the Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact §13981, we address petitioners’ alternative argument that the section’s civil remedy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s remedial power under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As noted above, Congress expressly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of authority to enact §13981.</p>
<p id="fb948a61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners’ §5 argument is founded on an assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. This assertion is supported by a voluminous congressional record.</p>
<p id="fb948a62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principles governing an analysis of congressional legislation under §5 are well settled. [T]he language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. These limitations are necessary to prevent the Fourteenth Amendment from obliterating the framers’ carefully crafted balance of power between the States and the National Government.</p>
<p id="fb948a63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. “[T]he principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.” Shelley v. Kraemer (1948).</p>
<p id="fb948a64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, we decided two cases interpreting the Amendment’s provisions, United States v. Harris (1883), and the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> (1883). We concluded that th[e] law[s] exceeded Congress’s §5 power because the law was “directed exclusively against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State, or their administration by her officers.” The force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems not only from the length of time they have been on the books, but also from the insight attributable to the Members of the Court at that time. Every Member had been appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, or Arthur—and each of their judicial appointees obviously had <span title="252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-252">p. 252</span>intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb948a65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners rely on United States v. Guest (1966), for the proposition that the rule laid down in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> is no longer good law. In <i>Guest</i>, the Court reversed the construction of an indictment under 18 U.S.C. §241, saying in the course of its opinion that “we deal here with issues of statutory construction, not with issues of constitutional power.” Three Members of the Court, in a separate opinion by Justice Brennan, expressed the view that the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> were wrongly decided, and that Congress could under §5 prohibit actions by private individuals. Three other Members of the Court, who joined the opinion of the Court, joined a separate opinion by Justice Clark which in two or three sentences stated the conclusion that Congress could “punis[h] all conspiracies—with or without state action—that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights.”</p>
<p id="fb94b176-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though these three Justices saw fit to opine on matters not before the Court in <i>Guest</i>, the Court had no occasion to revisit the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> and <i>Harris</i>, having determined “the indictment [charging private individuals with conspiring to deprive blacks of equal access to state facilities] in fact contain[ed] an express allegation of state involvement.”</p>
<p id="fb94b177-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 13981 is not aimed at proscribing discrimination by officials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not itself proscribe; it is directed not at any State or state actor, but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias. In the present cases, for example, §13981 visits no consequence whatever on any Virginia public official involved in investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala’s assault. The section is, therefore, unlike any of the §5 remedies that we have previously upheld.</p>
<p id="fb94b178-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Brzonkala’s complaint alleges that she was the victim of a brutal assault. But Congress’s effort in §13981 to provide a federal civil remedy can be sustained neither under the Commerce Clause nor under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the allegations here are true, no civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for the conduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.</p>
<p id="fb94b179-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb94b17a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given my conclusion on the Commerce Clause question, I need not consider Congress’s authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, I doubt the Court’s reasoning rejecting that source of authority. The Court points out that in United States v. Harris (1883), and the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> (1883), the Court held that §5 does not authorize Congress to use the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of power to remedy the conduct of private persons. That is certainly so. The Federal Government’s argument, however, is that Congress used §5 to remedy the actions of state actors, namely, those States which, through discriminatory design or the discriminatory conduct of their officials, failed to provide adequate (or any) state remedies for women injured by gender-motivated violence—a failure that the States, and Congress, documented in depth.</p>
<p id="fb94b17b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But why can Congress not provide a remedy against private actors? Those private actors, of course, did not themselves violate the Constitution. But this Court has held that Congress at least sometimes can enact remedial “[l]egislation . . . [that] prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional.” It intrudes little upon either States or private parties. It may lead state actors to improve their own <span title="253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-253">p. 253</span>remedial systems, primarily through example. It restricts private actors only by imposing liability for private conduct that is, in the main, already forbidden by state law. Why is the remedy “disproportionate”? And given the relation between remedy and violation—the creation of a federal remedy to substitute for constitutionally inadequate state remedies—where is the lack of “congruence”?</p>
<p id="fb94b17c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite my doubts about the majority’s §5 reasoning, I need not, and do not, answer the §5 question, which I would leave for more thorough analysis if necessary on another occasion. Rather, in my view, the Commerce Clause provides an adequate basis for the statute before us. And I would uphold its constitutionality as the “necessary and proper” exercise of legislative power granted to Congress by that Clause.</p>

<p id="fb94b17f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two different views as to the scope of Congress’s power under the post-Civil War Amendments and particularly under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. One approach is narrow and accords Congress only authority to prevent or provide remedies for violations of rights recognized by the Supreme Court; under this view, Congress cannot expand the scope of rights or provide additional rights. An alternative approach also accords Congress authority to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment to expand the scope of rights or even to create new rights. Under this view, Congress may create rights by statute where the Court has not found them in the Constitution, but Congress cannot dilute or diminish constitutional rights.</p>
<p id="fb94b180-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The choice between these two views is in part about a textual argument concerning what §5 means when it empowers Congress “to enforce” the amendment by appropriate legislation. Those who take the narrower view contend that Congress is not “enforcing” if it is creating new rights. But those who take the broader view argue that Congress is enforcing the amendment by creating greater protections than those found by the Court.</p>
<p id="fb94b181-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispute over these two views also is about the appropriate roles of the Court and Congress in deciding the substantive content of rights. Those who take the narrow position see it as solely the Court’s role to decide the rights protected under the Constitution; Congress’s role is limited to enacting laws to prevent and remedy violations. But those who adopt the broader view of Congress’s §5 power see both Congress and the Court as having authority to recognize and protect rights under the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb94b182-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with all of the material in this chapter, there also is an important underlying issue concerning the allocation of power between the federal and state governments. Advocates of the narrow view see it as limiting federal power, reserving more governance for the states, and lessening the instances in which the federal government can regulate state and local actions. In contrast, supporters of the broader approach defend it as creating needed national power to protect civil rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p id="fb94d793-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Katzenbach v. Morgan, the first case presented, the Court seemed to adopt the broader approach and accord Congress expansive authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In subsequent cases, City of Boerne v. Flores, and Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, the Court clearly chose the narrow view and limited Congress’s power under §5.</p><span title="254" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-254">p. 254</span>

<p id="fb94d799-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb94d79a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases concern the constitutionality of §4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That law, in the respects pertinent in these cases, provides that no person who has successfully completed the sixth primary grade in a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English shall be denied the right to vote in any election because of his inability to read or write English. Appellees, registered voters in New York City, brought this suit to challenge the constitutionality of §4(e) insofar as it pro tanto prohibits the enforcement of the election laws of New York requiring an ability to read and write English as a condition of voting.</p>
<p id="fb94d79b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Attorney General of the State of New York argues that an exercise of congressional power under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment that prohibits the enforcement of a state law can only be sustained if the judicial branch determines that the state law is prohibited by the provisions of the Amendment that Congress sought to enforce. More specifically, he urges that §4(e) cannot be sustained as appropriate legislation to enforce the Equal Protection Clause unless the judiciary decides—even with the guidance of a congressional judgment—that the application of the English literacy requirement prohibited by §4(e) is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause itself. We disagree. Neither the language nor history of §5 supports such a construction. A construction of §5 that would require a judicial determination that the enforcement of the state law precluded by Congress violated the Amendment, as a condition of sustaining the congressional enactment, would depreciate both congressional resourcefulness and congressional responsibility for implementing the Amendment. It would confine the legislative power in this context to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch was prepared to adjudge unconstitutional, or of merely informing the judgment of the judiciary by particularizing the “majestic generalities” of §1 of the Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb94d79c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus our task in this case is not to determine whether the New York English literacy requirement as applied to deny the right to vote to a person who successfully completed the sixth grade in a Puerto Rican school violates the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, our decision in Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Election, sustaining the North Carolina English literacy requirement as not in all circumstances prohibited by the first sections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, is inapposite. <i>Lassiter</i> did not present the question before us here: Without regard to whether the judiciary would find that the Equal Protection Clause itself nullifies New York’s English literacy requirement as so applied, could Congress prohibit the enforcement of the state law by legislating under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment? In answering this question, our task is limited to determining whether such legislation is, as required by §5, appropriate legislation to enforce the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fb94d79d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By including §5 the draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a specific provision applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment, the same broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18. We therefore proceed to the consideration whether §4(e) is “appropriate legislation” to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, that is, under the McCulloch v. Maryland standard, whether <span title="255" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-255">p. 255</span>§4(e) may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, whether it is “plainly adapted to that end” and whether it is not prohibited by but is consistent with “the letter and spirit of the [C]onstitution.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN115D2_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N115D2_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span></p>
<p id="fb94feaf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no doubt that §4(e) may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause. Congress explicitly declared that it enacted §4(e) “to secure the rights under the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment of persons educated in American-flag schools in which the predominant classroom language was other than English.” The persons referred to include those who have migrated from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to New York and who have been denied the right to vote because of their inability to read and write English, and the Fourteenth Amendment rights referred to include those emanating from the Equal Protection Clause. More specifically, §4(e) may be viewed as a measure to secure for the Puerto Rican community residing in New York nondiscriminatory treatment by government—both in the imposition of voting qualifications and the provision or administration of governmental services, such as public schools, public housing and law enforcement.</p>
<p id="fb94feb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 4(e) may be readily seen as “plainly adapted” to furthering these aims of the Equal Protection Clause. The practical effect of §4(e) is to prohibit New York from denying the right to vote to large segments of its Puerto Rican community. Congress has thus prohibited the State from denying to that community the right that is “preservative of all rights.” This enhanced political power will be helpful in gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services for the entire Puerto Rican community. Section 4(e) thereby enables the Puerto Rican minority better to obtain “perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws.” It was well within congressional authority to say that this need of the Puerto Rican minority for the vote warranted federal intrusion upon any state interests served by the English literacy requirement. It was for Congress, as the branch that made this judgment, to assess and weigh the various conflicting considerations. It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of these factors. It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did. There plainly was such a basis to support §4(e) in the application in question in this case. Any contrary conclusion would require us to be blind to the realities familiar to the legislators.</p>
<p id="fb94feb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since Congress undertook to legislate so as to preclude the enforcement of the state law, and did so in the context of a general appraisal of literacy requirements for voting, to which it brought a specially informed legislative competence, it was Congress’s prerogative to weigh these competing considerations. Here again, it is enough that we perceive a basis upon which Congress might predicate a judgment that the application of New York’s English literacy requirement to deny the right to vote to a person with a sixth grade education in Puerto Rican schools in which the language of instruction was other than English constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.<span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-256">p. 256</span></p>
<p id="fb94feb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore conclude that §4(e), in the application challenged in this case, is appropriate legislation to enforce the Equal Protection Clause and that the judgment of the District Court must be and hereby is reversed.</p>
<p id="fb94feb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Harlan</span>, whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb94feb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Worthy as its purposes may be thought by many, I do not see how §4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, can be sustained except at the sacrifice of fundamentals in the American constitutional system—the separation between the legislative and judicial function and the boundaries between federal and state political authority. By the same token I think that the validity of New York’s literacy test, a question which the Court considers only in the context of the federal statute, must be upheld. It will conduce to analytical clarity if I discuss the second issue first.</p>
<p id="fb94feb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any analysis of this problem must begin with the established rule of law that the franchise is essentially a matter of state concern, subject only to the overriding requirements of various federal constitutional provisions dealing with the franchise, e.g., the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-fourth Amendments, and, as more recently decided, to the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb94feb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1959, in Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., this Court dealt with substantially the same question and resolved it unanimously in favor of the legitimacy of a state literacy qualification. There a North Carolina English literacy test was challenged. We held that there was “wide scope” for State qualifications of this sort. I believe the same interests recounted in <i>Lassiter</i> indubitably point toward upholding the rationality of the New York voting test.</p>
<p id="fb94feb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pivotal question in this instance is what effect the added factor of a congressional enactment has on the straight equal protection argument dealt with above. The Court declares that since §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gives to the Congress power to “enforce” the prohibitions of the Amendment by “appropriate” legislation, the test for judicial review of any congressional determination in this area is simply one of rationality; that is, in effect, was Congress acting rationally in declaring that the New York statute is irrational? Although §5 most certainly does give to the Congress wide powers in the field of devising remedial legislation to effectuate the Amendment’s prohibition on arbitrary state action, I believe the Court has confused the issue of how much enforcement power Congress possesses under §5 with the distinct issue of what questions are appropriate for congressional determination and what questions are essentially judicial in nature.</p>
<p id="fb94feb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When recognized state violations of federal constitutional standards have occurred, Congress is of course empowered by §5 to take appropriate remedial measures to redress and prevent the wrongs. But it is a judicial question whether the condition with which Congress has thus sought to deal is in truth an infringement of the Constitution, something that is the necessary prerequisite to bringing the §5 power into play at all.</p>
<p id="fb94feb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 4(e), however, presents a significantly different type of congressional enactment. The question here is not whether the statute is appropriate remedial legislation to cure an established violation of a constitutional command, but whether there has in fact been an infringement of that constitutional command, that is, whether a particular state practice or, as here, a statute is so arbitrary or irrational as to offend the command of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That question is one for the judicial branch <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>ultimately to determine. Were the rule otherwise, Congress would be able to qualify this Court’s constitutional decisions under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments let alone those under other provisions of the Constitution, by resorting to congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. In view of this Court’s holding in <i>Lassiter</i>, that an English literacy test is a permissible exercise of state supervision over its franchise, I do not think it is open to Congress to limit the effect of that decision as it has undertaken to do by §4(e). In effect the Court reads §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment as giving Congress the power to define the substantive scope of the Amendment. If that indeed be the true reach of §5, then I do not see why Congress should not be able as well to exercise its §5 “discretion” by enacting statutes so as in effect to dilute equal protection and due process decisions of this Court. In all such cases there is room for reasonable men to differ as to whether or not a denial of equal protection or due process has occurred, and the final decision is one of judgment. Until today this judgment has always been one for the judiciary to resolve.</p>
<p id="fb94feba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To deny the effectiveness of this congressional enactment is not of course to disparage Congress’s exertion of authority in the field of civil rights; it is simply to recognize that the Legislative Branch like the other branches of federal authority is subject to the governmental boundaries set by the Constitution. To hold, on this record, that §4(e) overrides the New York literacy requirement seems to me tantamount to allowing the Fourteenth Amendment to swallow the State’s constitutionally ordained primary authority in this field. For if Congress by what, as here, amounts to mere ipse dixit can set that otherwise permissible requirement partially at naught I see no reason why it could not also substitute its judgment for that of the States in other fields of their exclusive primary competence as well.</p>

Flores, the Court adopted a very different view of the scope of Congress’s authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment than that taken by a majority in <i>Katzenbach</i>. To understand <i>City of Boerne</i>, which follows, a bit of background is necessary. In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the Supreme Court significantly narrowed the scope of the Free Exercise Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11622_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11622_ef80dd8a-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">34</a></span> Oregon law prohibited the consumption of peyote, a hallucinogenic substance. Native Americans challenged this law claiming that it infringed free exercise of religion because their religious rituals required the use of peyote. Under prior Supreme Court precedents, government actions burdening religion are upheld only if they are necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. The Supreme Court, in <i>Smith</i>, changed the law and held that the Free Exercise Clause cannot be used to challenge neutral laws of general applicability. The Oregon law prohibiting consumption of peyote was deemed neutral because it was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion and it was a law of general applicability.</p>
<p id="fb9525cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to this decision, in 1993, Congress overwhelmingly adopted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton.

Built in 1923, the church’s structure replicates the mission style of the region’s earlier history. The church seats about 230 worshippers, a number too small for its growing parish. Some 40 to 60 parishioners cannot be accommodated at some Sunday masses. In order to meet the needs of the congregation the Archbishop of San Antonio gave permission to the parish to plan alterations to enlarge the building.</p>
<p id="fb9525d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few months later, the Boerne City Council passed an ordinance authorizing the city’s Historic Landmark Commission to prepare a preservation plan with proposed historic landmarks and districts.

<p id="fb9525d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Soon afterwards, the Archbishop applied for a building permit so construction to enlarge the church could proceed. City authorities, relying on the ordinance and the designation of a historic district (which, they argued, included the church), denied the application. The Archbishop brought this suit challenging the permit denial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint contained various claims, but to this point the litigation has centered on RFRA and the question of its constitutionality. The Archbishop relied upon RFRA as one basis for relief from the refusal to issue the permit.</p>

<p id="fb954ced-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties disagree over whether RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress’s §5 power “to enforce” by “appropriate legislation” the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” nor deny any person “equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fb954cee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All must acknowledge that §5 is “a positive grant of legislative power” to Congress, Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966). Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress’s enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into “legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.” We have also concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress’s power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States.</p>
<p id="fb954cef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also true, however, that “[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.” In assessing the breadth of §5’s enforcement power, we begin with its text. Congress has been given the power “to enforce” the “provisions of this article.” We agree with respondent, of course, that Congress can enact legislation under §5 enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. The “provisions of this article,” to which §5 refers, include the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb954cf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress’s power under §5, however, extends only to “enforc[ing]” the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described this power as “remedial.” The design of the Amendment and the text of §5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power “to enforce,” not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the “provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].”</p>
<p id="fb954cf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. History and our case law support drawing the distinction, one apparent from the text of the Amendment.</p>

<p id="fb954cf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment’s history confirms the remedial, rather than substantive, nature of the Enforcement Clause. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction of the 39th Congress began drafting what would become the Fourteenth Amendment in January 1866. The objections to the Committee’s first draft of the Amendment, and the rejection of the draft, have a direct bearing on the central issue of defining Congress’s enforcement power. In February, Republican Representative John Bingham of Ohio reported the following draft <span title="260" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-260">p. 260</span>amendment to the House of Representatives on behalf of the Joint Committee: “The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure to the citizens of each State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the several States equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property.”</p>
<p id="fb954cf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposal encountered immediate opposition, which continued through three days of debate. Members of Congress from across the political spectrum criticized the Amendment, and the criticisms had a common theme: The proposed Amendment gave Congress too much legislative power at the expense of the existing constitutional structure. Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb954cf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1 of the new draft Amendment imposed self-executing limits on the States. Section 5 prescribed that “[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” Under the revised Amendment, Congress’s power was no longer plenary but remedial. Congress was granted the power to make the substantive constitutional prohibitions against the States effective. Representative Bingham said the new draft would give Congress “the power . . . to protect by national law the privileges and immunities of all the citizens of the Republic . . . whenever the same shall be abridged or denied by the unconstitutional acts of any State.” Representative Stevens described the new draft Amendment as “allow[ing] Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.”</p>
<p id="fb954cf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The design of the Fourteenth Amendment has proved significant also in maintaining the traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary. The first eight Amendments to the Constitution set forth self-executing prohibitions on governmental action, and this Court has had primary authority to interpret those prohibitions. The Bingham draft, some thought, departed from that tradition by vesting in Congress primary power to interpret and elaborate on the meaning of the new Amendment through legislation. Under it, “Congress, and not the courts, was to judge whether or not any of the privileges or immunities were not secured to citizens in the several States.” The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the Judiciary.</p>

<p id="fb954cf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedial and preventive nature of Congress’s enforcement power, and the limitation inherent in the power, were confirmed in our earliest cases on the Fourteenth Amendment. In the Civil Rights Cases (1883), the Court invalidated sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which prescribed criminal penalties for denying to any person “the full enjoyment of” public accommodations and conveyances, on the grounds that it exceeded Congress’s power by seeking to regulate private conduct. The Enforcement Clause, the Court said, did not authorize Congress to pass “general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective legislation; that is, such as may be necessary and proper for counteracting such laws as the States may adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited from making or enforcing. . . .” Although the specific holdings of these early cases might have been superseded or modified, <i>see</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964); United States v. <span title="261" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-261">p. 261</span>Guest (1966), their treatment of Congress’s §5 power as corrective or preventive, not definitional, has not been questioned.</p>

<p id="fb954cfa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any suggestion that Congress has a substantive, non-remedial power under the Fourteenth Amendment is not supported by our case law. If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment’s meaning, no longer would the Constitution be “superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.” It would be “on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.” Marbury v. Madison. Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power. Shifting legislative majorities could change the Constitution and effectively circumvent the difficult and detailed amendment process contained in Article V.</p>
<p id="fb954cfb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to consider whether RFRA can be considered enforcement legislation under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
</div>

<p id="fb954cfd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent contends that RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress’s remedial or preventive power. The Act, it is said, is a reasonable means of protecting the free exercise of religion as defined by <i>Smith</i>. It prevents and remedies laws which are enacted with the unconstitutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices. If Congress can prohibit laws with discriminatory effects in order to prevent racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, then it can do the same, respondent argues, to promote religious liberty.</p>
<p id="fb954cfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While preventive rules are sometimes appropriate remedial measures, there must be a congruence between the means used and the ends to be achieved. The appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented. Strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one.</p>
<p id="fb95740f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A comparison between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act is instructive. In contrast to the record which confronted Congress and the judiciary in the voting rights cases, RFRA’s legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years. Regardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRA cannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections. Preventive measures prohibiting certain types of laws may be appropriate when there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fb957410-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RFRA is not so confined. Sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. RFRA’s restrictions apply to every agency and official of the Federal, State, and local Governments. RFRA applies to all federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether adopted <span title="262" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-262">p. 262</span>before or after its enactment. RFRA has no termination date or termination mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion. The reach and scope of RFRA distinguish it from other measures passed under Congress’s enforcement power, even in the area of voting rights.</p>
<p id="fb957411-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the State must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. Claims that a law substantially burdens someone’s exercise of religion will often be difficult to contest. Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. Laws valid under <i>Smith</i> would fall under RFRA without regard to whether they had the object of stifling or punishing free exercise. We make these observations not to reargue the position of the majority in <i>Smith</i> but to illustrate the substantive alteration of its holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say one equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States’ traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.</p>
<p id="fb957412-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The substantial costs RFRA exacts, both in practical terms of imposing a heavy litigation burden on the States and in terms of curtailing their traditional general regulatory power, far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in <i>Smith</i>. Simply put, RFRA is not designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of their treatment of religion. In most cases, the state laws to which RFRA applies are not ones which will have been motivated by religious bigotry. If a state law disproportionately burdened a particular class of religious observers, this circumstance might be evidence of an impermissible legislative motive.</p>
<p id="fb957413-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our national experience teaches that the Constitution is preserved best when each part of the government respects both the Constitution and the proper actions and determinations of the other branches. When the Court has interpreted the Constitution, it has acted within the province of the Judicial Branch, which embraces the duty to say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison. When the political branches of the Government act against the background of a judicial interpretation of the Constitution already issued, it must be understood that in later cases and controversies the Court will treat its precedents with the respect due them under settled principles, including stare decisis, and contrary expectations must be disappointed. RFRA was designed to control cases and controversies, such as the one before us; but as the provisions of the federal statute here invoked are beyond congressional authority, it is this Court’s precedent, not RFRA, which must control.</p>

I agree with the Court that the issue before us is whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a proper exercise of Congress’s power to enforce §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But as a yardstick for measuring the constitutionality of RFRA, the Court uses its holding in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990), the decision that prompted Congress to enact RFRA, as a means of more rigorously enforcing the Free Exercise Clause. I remain of the view that <i>Smith</i> was wrongly decided, and I would use this case to reexamine the Court’s holding there. Therefore, I would direct the parties to brief the question whether <i>Smith</i> represents the correct understanding of the Free Exercise Clause and set the case for reargument. If the Court were to correct the misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in <i>Smith</i>, it would simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and allay the legitimate concerns of a majority in Congress who believed that <i>Smith</i> improperly restricted religious liberty. We would then be in a position to review RFRA in light of a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.</p>

<p id="fb957417-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark federal civil rights statute. Section 2 prohibits state and local governments from having election practices or systems that discriminate against minority voters. It authorizes litigation to enforce this prohibition. Congress believed that this was insufficient; voting rights litigation is expensive and time consuming. Also, Congress was aware that Southern states in particular kept changing their election systems to disenfranchise minority voters. Section 5 provides that jurisdictions with a history of race discrimination in voting must get “preclearance” from the Attorney General or a three-judge federal district court before changing their election systems. Section 4(B) defines those jurisdictions that must get preclearance.</p>
<p id="fb957418-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2006, Congress extended these latter provisions for another 25 years. In Shelby County, Alabama v.

In reading the case, notice that the Court does not use the test from City of Boerne v. Flores. Also, it is worth focusing on what constitutional principle is violated by Section 4(B) of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

This was strong medicine, but Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” As we explained in upholding the law, “exceptional conditions can justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate.” Reflecting the unprecedented nature of these measures, they were scheduled to expire after five years.</p>
<p id="fb957420-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed, they have been made more stringent, and are now scheduled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By 2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout [was] lower in the States originally covered by §5 than it [was] nationwide.” Since that time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-American voter turnout has come to exceed white voter turnout in five of the six States originally covered by §5, with a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one percent.</p>
<p id="fb959b31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that. The question is whether the Act’s extraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of the States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements. As we put it a short time ago, “the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.”</p>

<p id="fb959b34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the wake of the Civil War. It provides that “[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it gives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”</p>
<p id="fb959b35-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The first century of congressional enforcement of the Amendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.” Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Congress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any “standard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied . . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” The current version forbids any “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” Both the Federal Government and individuals have sued to enforce §2, and injunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block voting laws from going into effect. Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide, and is not at issue in this case.</p>
<p id="fb959b36-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other sections targeted only some parts of the country. At the time of the Act’s passage, these “covered” jurisdictions were those States or political subdivisions that had maintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as of November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election. §4(b). Such tests or devices included literacy and knowledge tests, good moral character requirements, the need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like. A covered jurisdiction could “bail out” of coverage if it had not used a test or device in the preceding five years “for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race <span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-265">p. 265</span>or color.” In 1965, the covered States included Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivisions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in Arizona.</p>
<p id="fb959b37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In those jurisdictions, §4 of the Act banned all such tests or devices. Section 5 provided that no change in voting procedures could take effect until it was approved by federal authorities in Washington, D.C.—either the Attorney General or a court of three judges. A jurisdiction could obtain such “preclearance” only by proving that the change had neither “the purpose [nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.”</p>
<p id="fb959b38-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they were set to expire after five years. In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five years, and extended the coverage formula in §4(b) to jurisdictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout as of 1968. That swept in several counties in California, New Hampshire, and New York. Congress also extended the ban in §4(a) on tests and devices nationwide.</p>
<p id="fb959b39-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1975, Congress reauthorized the Act for seven more years, and extended its coverage to jurisdictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout as of 1972. As a result of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona, and Texas, as well as several counties in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota, became covered jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="fb959b3a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but did not alter its coverage formula. Congress did, however, amend the bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of covered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequisites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must not have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive preclearance, or lost a §2 suit, in the ten years prior to seeking bailout.</p>
<p id="fb959b3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We upheld each of these reauthorizations against constitutional challenge. See Georgia v. United States (1973); City of Rome v. United States (1980); Lopez v. Monterey County (1999).</p>
<p id="fb959b3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights Act for 25 years, again without change to its coverage formula. Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act. Congress also amended §5 to prohibit more conduct than before. Section 5 now forbids voting changes with “any discriminatory purpose” as well as voting changes that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race, color, or language minority status, “to elect their preferred candidates of choice.”</p>

It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General has recently objected to voting changes proposed from within the county. Instead, in 2010, the county sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against their enforcement.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fb95c252-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution and laws of the United States are “the supreme Law of the Land.” U.S. Const., Art.VI, cl. 2. State legislation may not contravene federal law. The Federal Government does not, however, have a general right to review and veto state enactments before they go into effect. A proposal to grant such authority to “negative” state laws was considered at the Constitutional Convention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to take effect, subject to later challenge under the Supremacy Clause.</p>
<p id="fb95c253-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Outside the strictures of the Supremacy Clause, States retain broad autonomy in structuring their governments and pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Constitution provides that all powers not specifically granted to the Federal Government are reserved to the States or citizens. Amdt. 10. This “allocation of powers in our federal system preserves the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States.” But the federal balance “is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.”</p>
<p id="fb95c254-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More specifically, “the Framers of the Constitution intended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.”</p>
<p id="fb95c255-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only do States retain sovereignty under the Constitution, there is also a “fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” among the States. Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained that our Nation “was and is a union of States, equal in power, dignity and authority.” Coyle v. Smith (1911). Indeed, “the constitutional equality of the States is essential to the harmonious operation of the scheme upon which the Republic was organized.”</p>
<p id="fb95c256-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles. It suspends “all changes to state election law—however innocuous—until they have been precleared by federal authorities in Washington, D.C.” States must beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own, subject of course to any injunction in a §2 action. The Attorney General has 60 days to object to a preclearance request, longer if he requests more information. If a State seeks preclearance from a three-judge court, the process can take years.</p>
<p id="fb95c257-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and several additional counties). While one State waits months or years and expends funds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor can typically put the same law into effect immediately, through the normal legislative process. Even if a noncovered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences between those proceedings and preclearance proceedings; the preclearance proceeding “not only switches the burden of proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies substantive standards quite different from those governing the rest of the nation.”</p>
<p id="fb95c258-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in 1966, we described it as “stringent” and “potent.” We recognized that it “may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional power,” but concluded that “legislative measures not <span title="267" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-267">p. 267</span>otherwise appropriate” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.” We have since noted that the Act “authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state and local policymaking,” and represents an “extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the Federal Government.” As we reiterated in <i>Northwest Austin</i>, the Act constitutes “extraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.”</p>

<p id="fb95c25a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1966, we found these departures from the basic features of our system of government justified. The “blight of racial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century.” Several States had enacted a variety of requirements and tests “specifically designed to prevent” African-Americans from voting. Case-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent such racial discrimination in voting, in part because States “merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal decrees,” “enacted difficult new tests,” or simply “defied and evaded court orders.” Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act, only 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were registered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisiana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Those figures were roughly percentage points or more below the figures for whites.</p>
<p id="fb95c25b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, we concluded that “[u]nder the compulsion of these unique circumstances, Congress responded in a permissibly decisive manner.” We also noted then and have emphasized since that this extraordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to expire after five years.</p>
<p id="fb95c25c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that warranted it—made sense. We found that “Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary.”</p>

<p id="fb95c25e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically. Shelby County contends that the preclearance requirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage, is now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal of force. In the covered jurisdictions, “[v]oter turnout and registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” The tests and devices that blocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years.</p>
<p id="fb95c25f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the same when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that “[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first generation barriers experienced by minority voters, including increased numbers of registered minority voters, minority voter turnout, and minority representation in Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.”</p>
<p id="fb95c260-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in §5 or narrowed the scope of the coverage formula in §4(b) along the way. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features were reauthorized—as if nothing had changed. In fact, the Act’s unusual remedies have grown even stronger. When Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for another 25 years on top of the previous 40—a far cry from the initial five-year period. Congress also expanded the prohibitions in §5.</p>
<p id="fb95e971-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents do not deny that there have been improvements on the ground, but argue that much of this can be attributed to the deterrent effect of §5, which <span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-268">p. 268</span>dissuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimination that they would resume should §5 be struck down. Under this theory, however, §5 would be effectively immune from scrutiny; no matter how “clean” the record of covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be made that it was deterrence that accounted for the good behavior.</p>
<p id="fb95e972-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provisions of §5 apply only to those jurisdictions singled out by §4. We now consider whether that coverage formula is constitutional in light of current conditions.</p>

<p id="fb95e975-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage formula in 1966, we concluded that it was “rational in both practice and theory.” The formula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.</p>
<p id="fb95e976-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By 2009, however, we concluded that the “coverage formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.” As we explained, a statute’s “current burdens” must be justified by “current needs,” and any “disparate geographic coverage” must be “sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no longer does so.</p>
<p id="fb95e977-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula captures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been banned nationwide for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout numbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in the years since.</p>
<p id="fb95e978-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups: those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter registration and turnout, and those without those characteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.</p>

<p id="fb95e97a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act was reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of it. In assessing the “current need[]” for a preclearance system that treats States differently from one another today, that history cannot be ignored. During that time, largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data relevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data reflecting current needs.</p>
<p id="fb95e97b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve that purpose, Congress—if it is to divide the States—must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We made that clear in <i>Northwest Austin</i>, and we make it clear again today.</p>

<p id="fb95e97e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day. Contrary to the dissent’s contention, we are not ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it played no role in shaping the statutory formula before us today.</p>
<p id="fb95e97f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Congress had started from scratch in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to distinguish between States in such a fundamental way based on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an entirely different story. And it would have been irrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago, when such tests have been illegal since that time. But that is exactly what Congress has done.</p>
<p id="fb95e980-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in §2. We issue no holding on §5 itself, only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that exceptional conditions still exist justifying such an “extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the Federal Government.” Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.</p>

The question this case presents is who decides whether, as currently operative, §5 remains justifiable, this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to enforce the post-Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legislation.” With overwhelming support in both Houses, Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, §5 should continue in <span title="270" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-270">p. 270</span>force, unabated.

<p id="fb961098-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.” But the Court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to combat voting discrimination where other remedies had been tried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA’s requirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting laws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated records of rank discrimination against minority voting rights.</p>
<p id="fb961099-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress learned from experience that laws targeting particular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case litigation were inadequate to the task. Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s history. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting laws in the covered jurisdictions—those States and localities where opposition to the Constitution’s commands were most virulent—the VRA provided a fit solution for minority voters as well as for States.</p>
<p id="fb96109a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a century’s failure to fulfill the promise of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the VRA finally led to signal improvement on this front.</p>
<p id="fb96109b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the realization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date, surely has not eliminated all vestiges of discrimination against the exercise of the franchise by minority citizens. Jurisdictions covered by the preclearance requirement continued to submit, in large numbers, proposed changes to voting laws that the Attorney General declined to approve, auguring that barriers to minority voting would quickly resurface were the preclearance remedy eliminated. Congress also found that as “registration and voting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures may be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority voting strength.” Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the ballot, are aptly described as “second-generation barriers” to minority voting.</p>
<p id="fb96109c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing of legislative districts in an “effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting.” Another is adoption of a system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district voting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switching to at-large voting, the overall majority could control the election of each city council member, effectively eliminating the potency of the minority’s votes. A similar effect could be achieved if the city engaged in discriminatory annexation by incorporating majority-white areas into city limits, thereby decreasing the effect of VRA-occasioned increases in black voting. Whatever the device employed, this Court has long recognized that vote dilution, when adopted with a discriminatory purpose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of access to the ballot.</p>
<p id="fb96109d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="271" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-271">p. 271</span>In response to evidence of these substituted barriers, Congress reauthorized the VRA for five years in 1970, for seven years in 1975, and for 25 years in 1982. Each time, this Court upheld the reauthorization as a valid exercise of congressional power. As the 1982 reauthorization approached its 2007 expiration date, Congress again considered whether the VRA’s preclearance mechanism remained an appropriate response to the problem of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="fb96109e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress did not take this task lightly. Quite the opposite. The 109th Congress that took responsibility for the renewal started early and conscientiously. In October 2005, the House began extensive hearings, which continued into November and resumed in March 2006. In April 2006, the Senate followed suit, with hearings of its own. In May 2006, the bills that became the VRA’s reauthorization were introduced in both Houses. The House held further hearings of considerable length, as did the Senate, which continued to hold hearings into June and July. In mid-July, the House considered and rejected four amendments, then passed the reauthorization by a vote of 390 yeas to 33 nays. The bill was read and debated in the Senate, where it passed by a vote of 98 to 0. President Bush signed it a week later.</p>
<p id="fb9637af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the long course of the legislative process, Congress “amassed a sizable record.” The House and Senate Judiciary Committees held 21 hearings, heard from scores of witnesses, received a number of investigative reports and other written documentation of continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. In all, the legislative record Congress compiled filled more than 15,000 pages. The compilation presents countless “examples of flagrant racial discrimination” since the last reauthorization; Congress also brought to light systematic evidence that “intentional racial discrimination in voting remains so serious and widespread in covered jurisdictions that section 5 preclearance is still needed.”</p>

<p id="fb9637b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering this question, the Court does not write on a clean slate. It is well established that Congress’ judgment regarding exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments warrants substantial deference. The VRA addresses the combination of race discrimination and the right to vote, which is “preservative of all rights.” When confronting the most constitutionally invidious form of discrimination, and the most fundamental right in our democratic system, Congress’ power to act is at its height.</p>
<p id="fb9637b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basis for this deference is firmly rooted in both constitutional text and precedent. The Fifteenth Amendment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimination in voting rights, states that, in this domain, “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” In choosing this language, the Amendment’s framers invoked Chief Justice Marshall’s formulation of the scope of Congress’ powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause: “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch v. Maryland (1819).</p>
<p id="fb965ec3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of Congress adopted to shield the right to vote from racial discrimination, is inconsistent with the <span title="272" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-272">p. 272</span>letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Constitution read in light of the Civil War Amendments. Nowhere in today’s opinion, or in <i>Northwest Austin</i>, is there clear recognition of the transformative effect the Fifteenth Amendment aimed to achieve.</p>
<p id="fb965ec4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, in considering the constitutionality of the VRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of respect its judgments in this domain should garner.</p>
<p id="fb965ec5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing statute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal requirements of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization is at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative record justifying the initial legislation. Congress is entitled to consider that preexisting record as well as the record before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization. This is especially true where, as here, the Court has repeatedly affirmed the statute’s constitutionality and Congress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.</p>
<p id="fb965ec6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary arises because Congress has built a temporal limitation into the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of years (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary evidence, the continued need for the VRA.</p>
<p id="fb965ec7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, a reviewing court should expect the record supporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record originally made. Demand for a record of violations equivalent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a catch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less evidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that Congress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In contrast, if the statute was not working, there would be plenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to renew a failed regulatory regime.</p>
<p id="fb965ec8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to suggest that congressional power in this area is limitless. It is this Court’s responsibility to ensure that Congress has used appropriate means. The question meet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are “adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view.” The Court’s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that of Congress, but to determine whether the legislative record sufficed to show that “Congress could rationally have determined that [its chosen] provisions were appropriate methods.”</p>
<p id="fb965ec9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in Congress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to combat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Congress’ prerogative to use any rational means in exercise of its power in this area. And both precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means test should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the statute’s challenger should be higher, when what is at issue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has previously affirmed, and that Congress found, from contemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legislature’s legitimate objective.</p>

<p id="fb965ecb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully satisfies the standard stated in <i>McCulloch</i>: Congress may choose any means “appropriate” and “plainly adapted to” a legitimate constitutional end. As we shall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p id="fb965ecc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-273">p. 273</span>I begin with the evidence on which Congress based its decision to continue the preclearance remedy. The surest way to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is to see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discriminatory changes to voting laws. On that score, the record before Congress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were more DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than there were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization (490). All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked over 700 voting changes based on a determination that the changes were discriminatory.</p>
<p id="fb965ecd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress also received evidence that litigation under §2 of the VRA was an inadequate substitute for preclearance in the covered jurisdictions. Litigation occurs only after the fact, when the illegal voting scheme has already been put in place and individuals have been elected pursuant to it, thereby gaining the advantages of incumbency.</p>
<p id="fb9685de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conditions in the South have impressively improved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress noted this improvement and found that the VRA was the driving force behind it. But Congress also found that voting discrimination had evolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that eliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that had been made.</p>
<p id="fb9685df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question, moreover, that the covered jurisdictions have a unique history of problems with racial discrimination in voting. Consideration of this long history, still in living memory, was altogether appropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to recognize that “history did not end in 1965.” But the Court ignores that “what’s past is prologue.” W. Shakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And “[t]hose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” 1 G. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress was especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains already made and to prevent backsliding.</p>
<p id="fb9685e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thousands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance, conditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that the formula was still justified by “current needs.”</p>

<p id="fb9685e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress approached the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA with great care and seriousness. The same cannot be said of the Court’s opinion today. The Court makes no genuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative record that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on increases in voter registration and turnout as if that were the whole story. Without even identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively brushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and declines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record shows.” One would expect more from an opinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of civil-rights legislation.</p>
<p id="fb9685e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right, given its usual restraint, does the Court even address Shelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the Court veers away from controlling precedent regarding the “equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil War Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not even deign to grapple with the legislative record.</p>
<p id="fb9685e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="274" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-274">p. 274</span>Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment. For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to end racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made.</p>
<p id="fb9685e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee as “one of the most extensive considerations of any piece of legislation that the United States Congress has dealt with in the 27 [and a half] years” he had served in the House. After exhaustive evidence-gathering and deliberative process, Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was the judgment of Congress that “40 years has not been a sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard for the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed by the Constitution.” That determination of the body empowered to enforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legislation” merits this Court’s utmost respect. In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress’ decision.</p>
