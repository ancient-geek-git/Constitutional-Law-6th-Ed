<p id="fb5eace9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am very grateful to the many people who made this book possible. First, I want to thank Carol McGeehan, who suggested that I write this book and who helped me in formulating its approach. I am grateful to Joe Terry and everyone at the Froebe Group for their assistance. As always, Wolters Kluwer has been everything an author could hope for and more.</p>
<p id="fb5eacea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, I am grateful for all the institutional support I received in completing the first edition of this book at the University of Southern California Law School and the second edition at Duke University School of Law. At USC, Deans Scott Bice and Matthew Spitzer were enormously supportive of this book and of my work. Darin Fox provided terrific computer assistance, and my assistant, Margaret Miller, was invaluable in helping me complete this book and supporting me in all my professional endeavors for 15 years. At Duke, Dean Katherine Bartlett was wonderfully supportive of my work, including this book. I prepared the third, fourth and fifth editions at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, where I was tremendously assisted by Brandy Stewart. And this edition was prepared at University of California, Berkeley School of Law. I am very grateful to my assistant, Whitney Mello.</p>
<p id="fb5eaceb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, many friends provided excellent comments and suggestions that are reflected throughout the book. Barry Friedman and Bill Marshall helped me develop the concept of the book and played an early key role in my writing it. Larry Simon and Marcy Strauss read chapters and provided useful suggestions. I am also very grateful to Doug Laycock, John Eastman, James Kushner, Evan Lee, Sheldon Nahmod, Chris Schroeder, Neil Siegel, Stephen Siegel, Marcy Strauss, Len Strickman, and Nadine Strossen for their helpful comments on the earlier editions. Jonathan Miller and Clifford Rosky provided valuable suggestions as I was completing this edition.</p>
<p id="fb5eacec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, I am very appreciative of my research assistants. I received great assistance from Robin Bechtold, Diara Fleming, and Amy Kreutner on the first edition; from Chris Baird, David Breau, Leslie Cooley, Sarah Kline, and Michelle Riskind on the second edition; from Kara Kapp and Jonathan Tam on the third edition; from Francisco Balderamma and Tina Salvato on the fourth edition; from Laura Lively on the fifth edition; and from Amandra Sadra and David Fernandez on this edition.</p>
<p id="fb5ed3fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and most important, I thank my family: my wife, Catherine Fisk, and my children, Jeff, Adam, Alex, and Mara, and my daughter-in-law, Kim, and my grandchildren, Andrew and Sarah. Their love, support, and encouragement mean more than words can ever express.</p>
