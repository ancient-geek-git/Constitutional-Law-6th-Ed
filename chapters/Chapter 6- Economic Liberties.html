<p id="fbd4c6dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some constitutional rights can be grouped together under the category of “economic liberties.” Economic liberties generally refer to constitutional rights concerning the ability to enter into and enforce contracts; to pursue a trade or profession; and to acquire, possess, and convey property.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the Contracts Clause found in Article I, §10 of the Constitution provides that “[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” Also, several constitutional provisions protect property rights. The Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause states “nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, respectively, provide that neither the federal nor state governments can take a person’s property (or life or liberty) without due process of law. At times, the Court also has used the Due Process Clause to protect other economic liberties such as freedom of contract, freedom to pursue a livelihood, and freedom to practice a trade or profession.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter focuses on all of these economic liberties. Throughout this chapter the key normative issue concerns the appropriate degree of judicial protection for economic liberties. How important are the rights of property and contracting? What was the framers’ intent concerning these rights? Does the legislature have a special expertise concerning these rights that justifies a greater degree of judicial deference compared to when the Court deals with political and civil liberties, such as freedom of speech and the right to vote? What, if anything, was wrong with the Court’s decisions in the first third of the twentieth century aggressively protecting economic rights? Since 1937, has the Court unduly or appropriately deferred to government economic regulations?</p>
<div id="fbd4c6df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbd4c6e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbd4c6e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The framers obviously were concerned about protecting economic rights and thus included in the Constitution provisions such as the Contracts Clause and the Takings Clause. Indeed, Charles Beard, in a famous book published early in the twentieth century, argued that the primary impetus for the Constitution <span title="580" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-580">p. 580</span>was a desire to protect property and wealth.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10044_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10044_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> Although later historians have challenged Beard’s analysis and conclusions,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> there is no doubt that the framers intended to protect economic rights.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court’s protection of economic liberties has varied enormously over time. In the early nineteenth century, the Court invoked natural law principles to protect property rights.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1005C_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1005C_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> Also, throughout the nineteenth century, the Court aggressively used the Contracts Clause to limit the ability of states to interfere with existing contractual obligations.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing until 1937, the Court found that freedom of contract was a basic right under the liberty and property provisions of the Due Process Clause. During this period of constitutional history, sometimes referred to as the <i>Lochner</i> era,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10069_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10069_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> the Court aggressively protected economic rights under the Due Process Clause. Many state laws, such as minimum wage and maximum hour statutes, were declared unconstitutional as violating the Fourteenth Amendment by impermissibly interfering with freedom of contract. The Contracts Clause was not used often during this era; the protection of freedom of contract under the Due Process Clause made the Contracts Clause superfluous. Freedom of contract under the Due Process Clause limited the government’s ability both to impair existing contracts and to regulate the content of future contracts; the Contracts Clause always has been confined to the former.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is extremely important to note that during this same era the Court used federalism to limit the ability of Congress to regulate the economy. From the late nineteenth century until 1937, the Court narrowly defined the scope of Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause and it also found that the Tenth Amendment reserved a zone of authority exclusively to the states. In other words, if a state adopted a minimum wage or a maximum hour law, it likely would have been invalidated for violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But if the federal government adopted the same law, it would have been declared unconstitutional as exceeding the scope of Congress’s powers or as violating states’ rights and the Tenth Amendment. The decisions during this era concerning the scope of Congress’s powers are presented in Chapter 2. Although the doctrines used were different, they were inspired by the same philosophy: a strong commitment to a laissez-faire economy and to protecting business from government regulations.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After 1937, the law changed dramatically and the Court adopted a policy of great deference to government economic regulations. No longer did the Court protect freedom of contract under the liberty of the Due Process Clause. Nor did the Court impose limits on Congress’s ability to regulate the economy based on federalism or on narrow definitions of federal powers.</p>
<p id="fbd4c6ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This reluctance to protect economic liberties also has manifested itself in cases under the Contracts Clause. Only twice since 1937 has the Court found <span title="581" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-581">p. 581</span>that any law violates the Contracts Clause in Article I, §10.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10080_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10080_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span> However, especially in the last two decades, the Court has used the Takings Clause to protect property rights.</p>

<p id="fbd4edfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section B examines economic substantive due process. Specifically, as discussed below, the focus is on the Court’s interpretation of the word “liberty” in the Due Process Clause to protect freedom of contract as a fundamental right. The discussion of substantive due process is placed first simply because it has dominated the Court’s approach to economic liberties in this century. In the first third of the twentieth century, the Court’s use of substantive due process to protect economic rights made most of the other constitutional provisions in the area unnecessary. Since 1937, however, the Court’s tremendous reluctance to use economic substantive due process has been paralleled by a general unwillingness to safeguard economic liberties.</p>
<p id="fbd4edff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section C focuses on the Contracts Clause. It briefly describes the Court’s active use of this provision in the nineteenth century and then examines contemporary decisions limiting the scope of this Clause.</p>
<p id="fbd4ee00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Section D discusses the Takings Clause. Four major questions are considered: What is a “taking”? What is “property”? When is a taking for “public use”? And what is the requirement for “just compensation”?</p>

<p id="fbd4ee05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide, respectively, that neither the federal nor the state governments can deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Due Process Clauses have been interpreted to provide two different types of protection. One is termed “procedural due process.” As the phrase implies, this refers to the procedures that government must follow when it takes away a person’s life, liberty, or property. For example, procedural due process often focuses on what kind of notice and what type of a hearing the government must provide when it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Procedural due process is presented in detail in Chapter 8.</p>
<p id="fbd4ee06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other use of the Due Process Clause is called “substantive due process.” Substantive due process asks whether the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person’s life, liberty, or property. In other words, the focus is on the sufficiency of the justification for the government’s action, not on the procedures the government has followed. For example, when a right under the Due Process Clause is deemed fundamental by the Supreme Court, the government must prove that its action is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose.</p>
<p id="fbd4ee07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>A simple example contrasts procedural and substantive due process. The Supreme Court has held that the word “liberty” in the Due Process Clause protects a fundamental right of parents to the custody of their children. The Court has said that “procedural due process” requires notice and a hearing—-procedures—before termination of custody. By comparison, “substantive due process” requires that the government show a compelling reason for terminating custody, such as by proving parental abuse or neglect.</p>
<p id="fbd4ee08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the course of American history, substantive due process has been used primarily in two areas: protecting economic liberties and safeguarding privacy. The former is the focus of this section. The latter, on privacy and autonomy rights, is discussed in Chapter 8.</p>
<p id="fbd4ee09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In presenting economic substantive due process, this section next describes the early history of the doctrine. Then it presents the economic substantive due process cases in the late nineteenth century through 1937, when the Supreme Court aggressively used this doctrine to invalidate government economic regulations. Finally, the section concludes by examining the economic substantive due process decisions since 1937, a time of great judicial deference to government economic regulations.</p>

<p id="fbd5151c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court rejected the first attempts to use the Due Process Clause to protect economic rights from government interference.

The Court emphasized that due process is met as long as the government’s <i>procedures</i> are in accordance with the law.</p>
<p id="fbd5151e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1872), the Court expressly rejected a substantive due process claim.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100E7_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100E7_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span> The <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> involved a challenge to a Louisiana law that granted a private company a 25-year monopoly in the livestock landing and slaughterhouse business. The law also required that the company allow any person to use the facilities to slaughter animals for a fixed fee.</p>
<p id="fbd51520-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several butchers brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the grant of a monopoly. In addition to arguing that the law was involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, that it violated the Privileges or Immunities Clause, and that it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiffs contended that it denied their right to practice their trade and thus violated the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court rejected all of these arguments. As to due process, the Court emphasized that this Clause concerned the procedures that government must follow and thus could not be used to challenge the law for interfering with the right of butchers to practice their trade. Indeed, the Court said that “under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade by the butchers of New Orleans be held to be a deprivation of property <span title="583" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-583">p. 583</span>within the meaning of that provision.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F9_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100F9_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span> The Court flatly rejected the idea that the Due Process Clause could be used to safeguard a right to practice a trade or profession from arbitrary government interference.</p>
<p id="fbd51522-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Field and Bradley strongly dissented. In addition to disagreeing with the majority as to the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Field and Bradley also differed as to the content of the Due Process Clause. They saw the Due Process Clause as limiting the ability of states to adopt arbitrary laws, especially ones that interfered with natural rights. Justice Bradley, for example, declared, “[T]he individual citizen, as a necessity, must be left free to adopt such calling, profession, or trade as may seem to him most conducive to that end. Without this right he cannot be a freeman. This right to choose one’s calling is an essential part of that liberty which it is the object of government to protect; and a calling, when chosen, is a man’s property and right. Liberty and property are not protected where these rights are arbitrarily assailed.” In other words, Justice Bradley interpreted the words liberty and property in the Due Process Clause as protecting a right to practice a trade or profession and believed that arbitrary interference with these rights violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Although this position was rejected by a majority of the Court in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, it soon became the majority view of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fbd51523-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the 1870s, government regulation significantly increased as industrialization changed the nature of the economy. Simultaneously, businesses turned to the courts to have the new regulatory laws declared unconstitutional. At the same time, over these decades, scholars and judges increasingly espoused a belief in a laissez-faire, unregulated economy. In part, this was based on a philosophy of social Darwinism, which professed that society would thrive with the least government regulation interference, allowing the “best” to advance and prosper.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010A_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1010A_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span> Additionally, this view was based on a belief that government regulations unduly interfered with the natural rights of people to own and use their property and with a basic liberty interest in freedom of contract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10113_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10113_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span> Furthermore, support for a laissez-faire philosophy simply reflected hostility by businesses to the increased government regulation designed to protect workers, unions, consumers, and competitors.</p>
<p id="fbd51526-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Loan Association v. Topeka, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 655 (1874), decided one year after the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, is regarded as one of the first instances of the Court’s using natural law principles to limit government regulatory power. In Loan Association v. Topeka, the Court invalidated a city law that imposed a tax to fund bonds to attract private businesses to Topeka. Without expressly referring to the Constitution because the case arose as a diversity suit, the Court invalidated the law as “purely in aid of private or personal [objects] beyond the legislative power, and an unauthorized invasion of private right.”</p>
<p id="fbd51527-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the next two decades, in a series of cases, the Supreme Court rejected due process challenges to government economic regulations. Yet, in these cases, Supreme Court dicta indicated that it would invalidate laws as violating due process if they interfered with natural principles of justice. Although these cases <span title="584" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-584">p. 584</span>articulated the principles of substantive economic due process, the Court did not use them to declare laws unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fbd51528-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876), the Court upheld a state law that set maximum rates for grain-storage warehouses. The Court indicated, however, that “under some circumstances” regulation of business would be found to violate due process. The Court said that the central question was whether the “private property is ‘affected with a public interest,’ . . . [because] when one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good.” The Court expressly declared that it was for the judiciary to evaluate the reasonableness of state regulations. The Court stated, “Undoubtedly, in mere private contracts, relating to matters in which the public has no interest, what is reasonable must be ascertained judicially.”</p>
<p id="fbd51529-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Railroad Commission Cases</i>, 116 U.S. 307 (1886), the Court upheld a state law regulating railroad rates, but the Court indicated that due process could be used to challenge such rates in the future. The Court stated that the “power to regulate is not a power to destroy. Under pretence of regulating fares and freights, the State cannot require a railroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward; neither can it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for public use without just compensation, or without due process of law.” Indeed, just a few years later, the Court found a state railroad regulation to violate the Due Process Clause and held that “[t]he question of the reasonableness of a rate of charge for transportation by a railroad company is eminently a question for judicial investigation, requiring due process of law for its determination.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10137_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10137_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span></p>
<p id="fbd53c3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), the Court upheld as constitutional a state law that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages. But the Court strongly indicated that state laws would be invalidated as violating due process unless they truly were an exercise of the state’s police power. The Court said that if “a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is a palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts so to adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbd53c3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Munn v. Illinois, the <i>Railroad Commission Cases</i>, and Mugler v. Kansas were important for articulating that due process was a limit on the government’s regulatory power, even though in each of these cases the Court ruled in favor of the government. The Court expressed the philosophy that was to dominate constitutional law for the first third of the twentieth century. Moreover, at about the same time, in 1886, the Supreme Court held that corporations were “persons” under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10147_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10147_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span> This meant, of course, that corporations could use the Constitution and the philosophy expressed in cases such as <i>Munn</i>, the <i>Railroad Commission Cases</i>, and <i>Mugler</i> to challenge government regulations.</p>

<p id="fbd53c47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A conditional prohibition in regard to foreign insurance companies doing business within the state of Louisiana is to be found in article 236 of the constitution of that state, which reads as follows: “No foreign corporation shall do any business in this state without having one or more known places of business and an authorized agent or agents in the state upon whom process may be served.”</p>
<p id="fbd56358-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt of the power of the state to prohibit foreign insurance companies from doing business within its limits. The state can impose such conditions as it pleases upon the doing of any business by those companies within its borders, and unless the conditions be complied with the prohibition may be absolute.</p>
<p id="fbd56359-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, [however], the only act which it is claimed was a violation of the statute in question consisted in sending the letter through the mail notifying the company of the property to be covered by the policy already delivered. We have, then, a contract which it is conceded was made outside and beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana, being made and to be performed within the state of New York, where the premiums were to be paid, and losses, if any, adjusted. The letter of notification did not constitute a contract made or entered into within the state of Louisiana. It was but the performance of an act rendered necessary by the provisions of the contract already made between the parties outside of the state. It was a mere notification that the contract already in existence would attach to that particular property. In any event, the contract was made in New York, outside of the jurisdiction of Louisiana, even though the policy was not to attach to the particular property until the notification was sent.</p>
<p id="fbd5635a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The supreme court of Louisiana says that the act of writing within that state the letter of notification was an act therein done to effect an insurance on property then in the state, in a marine insurance company which had not complied with its laws, and such act was therefore prohibited by the statute. As so construed, we think the statute is a violation of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution, in that it deprives the defendants of their liberty without due process of law. The statute which forbids such act does not become due process of law, because it is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution of the Union. The “liberty” mentioned in that amendment means, not only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical restraint of his person, as by incarceration, but the term is deemed to embrace the right of the citizen to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties; to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out to a successful conclusion the purposes above mentioned.</p>
<p id="fbd5635b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Has not a citizen of a state, under the provisions of the federal constitution above mentioned, a right to contract outside of the state for insurance on his property,—a right of which state legislation cannot deprive him? We are not alluding to acts done within the state by an insurance company or its agents doing business therein, which are in violation of the state statutes. When we speak of the liberty to contract for insurance or to do an act to effectuate such a contract already existing, we refer to and have in mind the facts of this case, where the contract was made outside the state, and as such was a valid and proper <span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-586">p. 586</span>contract. The act done within the limits of the state, under the circumstances of this case and for the purpose therein mentioned, we hold a proper act,—one which the defendants were at liberty to perform, and which the state legislature had no right to prevent, at least with reference to the federal constitution. To deprive the citizen of such a right as herein described without due process of law is illegal. Such a statute as this in question is not due process of law, because it prohibits an act which under the federal constitution the defendants had a right to perform. This does not interfere in any way with the acknowledged right of the state to enact such legislation in the legitimate exercise of its police or other powers as to it may seem proper. In the exercise of such right, however, care must be taken not to infringe upon those other rights of the citizen which are protected by the federal constitution.</p>
<p id="fbd5635c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company of New York has done no business of insurance within the state of Louisiana, and has not subjected itself to any provisions of the statute in question. It had the right to enter into a contract in New York with citizens of Louisiana for the purpose of insuring the property of its citizens, even if that property were in the state of Louisiana, and correlatively the citizens of Louisiana had the right without the state of entering into contract with an insurance company for the same purpose. Any act of the state legislature which should prevent the entering into such a contract, or the mailing within the state of Louisiana of such a notification as is mentioned in this case, is an improper and illegal interference with the conduct of the citizen, although residing in Louisiana, in his right to contract and to carry out the terms of a contract validly entered into outside and beyond the jurisdiction of the state. For these reasons we think the statute in question was a violation of the federal constitution.</p>
<p id="fbd5635d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eight years after <i>Allgeyer</i>, the Supreme Court followed its reasoning and used substantive due process to invalidate a state law protecting workers in Lochner v. New York. <i>Lochner</i> is the most famous case of the era, in part because it so clearly expressed the themes followed by the Court in using freedom of contract under the Due Process Clause to limit government economic regulations.</p>

<p id="fbd56366-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute necessarily interferes with the right of contract between the employer and employees, concerning the number of hours in which the latter <span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>may labor in the bakery of the employer. The general right to make a contract in relation to his business is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Allgeyer v. Louisiana. Under that provision no state can deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment, unless there are circumstances which exclude the right.</p>
<p id="fbd58a77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are, however, certain powers, existing in the sovereignty of each state in the Union, somewhat vaguely termed police powers, the exact description and limitation of which have not been attempted by the courts. Those powers, broadly stated, and without, at present, any attempt at a more specific limitation, relate to the safety, health, morals, and general welfare of the public. Both property and liberty are held on such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the governing power of the state in the exercise of those powers, and with such conditions the 14th Amendment was not designed to interfere. Mugler v. Kansas.</p>
<p id="fbd58a78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state, therefore, has power to prevent the individual from making certain kinds of contracts, and in regard to them the Federal Constitution offers no protection. If the contract be one which the state, in the legitimate exercise of its police power, has the right to prohibit, it is not prevented from prohibiting it by the 14th Amendment. Contracts in violation of a statute, either of the Federal or state government, or a contract to let one’s property for immoral purposes, or to do any other unlawful act, could obtain no protection from the Federal Constitution, as coming under the liberty of person or of free contract. Therefore, when the state, by its legislature, in the assumed exercise of its police powers, has passed an act which seriously limits the right to labor or the right of contract in regard to their means of livelihood between persons who are both employer and employee, it becomes of great importance to determine which shall prevail—the right of the individual to labor for such time as he may choose, or the right of the state to prevent the individual from laboring, or from entering into any contract to labor, beyond a certain time prescribed by the state.</p>
<p id="fbd58a79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court has recognized the existence and upheld the exercise of the police powers of the states in many cases. Among the later cases where the state law has been upheld by this court is that of Holden v. Hardy. A provision in the act of the legislature of Utah was there under consideration, the act limiting the employment of workmen in all underground mines or workings, to eight hours per day, “except in cases of emergency, where life or property is in imminent danger.” It also limited the hours of labor in smelting and other institutions for the reduction or refining of ores or metals to eight hours per day, except in like cases of emergency. The act was held to be a valid exercise of the police powers of the state. It was held that the kind of employment, mining, smelting, etc., and the character of the employees in such kinds of labor, were such as to make it reasonable and proper for the state to interfere to prevent the employees from being constrained by the rules laid down by the proprietors in regard to labor.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must, of course, be conceded that there is a limit to the valid exercise of the police power by the state. There is no dispute concerning this general proposition. Otherwise the 14th Amendment would have no efficacy and the legislatures of the states would have unbounded power, and it would be enough to say that any piece of legislation was enacted to conserve the morals, the health, or the safety of the people; such legislation would be valid, no matter how absolutely <span title="588" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-588">p. 588</span>without foundation the claim might be. The claim of the police power would be a mere pretext,—become another and delusive name for the supreme sovereignty of the state to be exercised free from constitutional restraint. This is not contended for. In every case that comes before this court, therefore, where legislation of this character is concerned, and where the protection of the Federal Constitution is sought, the question necessarily arises: Is this a fair, reasonable, and appropriate exercise of the police power of the state, or is it an unreasonable, unnecessary, and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty, or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and his family? Of course the liberty of contract relating to labor includes both parties to it. The one has as much right to purchase as the other to sell labor.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not a question of substituting the judgment of the court for that of the legislature. If the act be within the power of the state it is valid, although the judgment of the court might be totally opposed to the enactment of such a law. But the question would still remain: Is it within the police power of the state? and that question must be answered by the court.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question whether this act is valid as a labor law, pure and simple, may be dismissed in a few words. There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of person or the right of free contract, by determining the hours of labor, in the occupation of a baker. There is no contention that bakers as a class are not equal in intelligence and capacity to men in other trades or manual occupations, or that they are not able to assert their rights and care for themselves without the protecting arm of the state, interfering with their independence of judgment and of action. They are in no sense wards of the state. Viewed in the light of a purely labor law, with no reference whatever to the question of health, we think that a law like the one before us involves neither the safety, the morals, nor the welfare, of the public, and that the interest of the public is not in the slightest degree affected by such an act. The law must be upheld, if at all, as a law pertaining to the health of the individual engaged in the occupation of a baker. It does not affect any other portion of the public than those who are engaged in that occupation. Clean and wholesome bread does not depend upon whether the baker works but ten hours per day or only sixty hours a week. The limitation of the hours of labor does not come within the police power on that ground.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a question of which of two powers or rights shall prevail, the power of the state to legislate or the right of the individual to liberty of person and freedom of contract. The mere assertion that the subject relates, though but in a remote degree, to the public health, does not necessarily render the enactment valid. The act must have a more direct relation, as a means to an end, and the end itself must be appropriate and legitimate, before an act can be held to be valid which interferes with the general right of an individual to be free in his person and in his power to contract in relation to his own labor.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is unfortunately true that labor, even in any department, may possibly carry with it the seeds of unhealthiness. But are we all, on that account, at the mercy of legislative majorities? A printer, a tinsmith, a locksmith, a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, a dry goods clerk, a bank’s, a lawyer’s, or a physician’s clerk, or a clerk in almost any kind of business, would all come under the power of the legislature, on this assumption. No trade, no occupation, no mode of earning one’s living, could escape this all-pervading power, and the acts of the legislature in limiting the hours of labor in all employments would be valid, although such <span title="589" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-589">p. 589</span>limitation might seriously cripple the ability of the laborer to support himself and his family.</p>
<p id="fbd58a7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also urged, pursuing the same line of argument, that it is to the interest of the state that its population should be strong and robust, and therefore any legislation which may be said to tend to make people healthy must be valid as health laws, enacted under the police power. If this be a valid argument and a justification for this kind of legislation, it follows that the protection of the Federal Constitution from undue interference with liberty of person and freedom of contract is visionary, wherever the law is sought to be justified as a valid exercise of the police power. Scarcely any law but might find shelter under such assumptions, and conduct, properly so called, as well as contract, would come under the restrictive sway of the legislature. Not only the hours of employees, but the hours of employers, could be regulated, and doctors, lawyers, scientists, all professional men, as well as athletes and artisans, could be forbidden to fatigue their brains and bodies by prolonged hours of exercise, lest the fighting strength of the state be impaired. We mention these extreme cases because the contention is extreme. We do not believe in the soundness of the views which uphold this law.</p>
<p id="fbd58a80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the contrary, we think that such a law as this, although passed in the assumed exercise of the police power, and as relating to the public health, or the health of the employees named, is not within that power, and is invalid. The act is not, within any fair meaning of the term, a health law, but is an illegal interference with the rights of individuals, both employers and employees, to make contracts regarding labor upon such terms as they may think best, or which they may agree upon with the other parties to such contracts. Statutes of the nature of that under review, limiting the hours in which grown and intelligent men may labor to earn their living, are mere meddlesome interferences with the rights of the individual, and they are not saved from condemnation by the claim that they are passed in the exercise of the police power and upon the subject of the health of the individual whose rights are interfered with, unless there be some fair ground, reasonable in and of itself, to say that there is material danger to the public health, or to the health of the employees, if the hours of labor are not curtailed. This interference on the part of the legislatures of the several states with the ordinary trades and occupations of the people seems to be on the increase. It is impossible for us to shut our eyes to the fact that many of the laws of this character, while passed under what is claimed to be the police power for the purpose of protecting the public health or welfare, are, in reality, passed from other motives. We are justified in saying so when, from the character of the law and the subject upon which it legislates, it is apparent that the public health or welfare bears but the most remote relation to the law. Under such circumstances the freedom of master and employee to contract with each other in relation to their employment, and in defining the same, cannot be prohibited or interfered with, without violating the Federal Constitution.</p>

Sunday laws and usury laws are ancient examples. The liberty of the citizen to do as he likes so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of others to do the same, which has been a shibboleth for some well-known writers, is interfered with by school laws, by the Postoffice, by every state or municipal institution which takes his money for purposes thought desirable, whether he likes it or not.

It does not need research to show that no such sweeping condemnation can be passed upon the statute before us. A reasonable man might think it a proper measure on the score of health. Men whom I certainly could not pronounce unreasonable would uphold it as a first instalment of a general regulation of the hours of work.

It is plain that this statute was enacted in order to protect the physical well-being of those who work in bakery and confectionery establishments. It must be remembered that this statute does not apply to all kinds of business. It applies only to work in bakery and confectionery establishments, in which, as all know, the air constantly breathed by workmen is not as pure and healthful as that to be found in some other establishments or out of doors.</p>

The eyes also suffer through this dust, which is responsible for the many cases of running eyes among the bakers. The long hours of toil to which all bakers are subjected produce rheumatism, cramps, and swollen legs.” Nearly all bakers are palefaced and of more delicate health than the workers of other crafts, which is chiefly due to their hard work and their irregular and unnatural mode of living, whereby the power of resistance against disease is greatly diminished. The average age of a baker is below that of other workmen; they seldom live over their fiftieth year, most of them dying between the ages of forty and fifty. During periods of epidemic diseases the bakers are generally the first to succumb to the disease, and the number swept away during such periods far exceeds the number of other crafts in comparison to the men employed in the respective industries.</p>

We cannot say that the state has acted without reason, nor ought we to proceed upon the theory that its action is a mere sham. Our duty, I submit, is to sustain the statute as not being in conflict with the Federal Constitution, for the reason—and such is an all-sufficient reason—it is not shown to be plainly and palpably inconsistent with that instrument. Let the state alone in the management of its purely domestic affairs, so long as it does not appear beyond all question that it has violated the Federal Constitution. This view necessarily results from the principle that the health and safety of the people of a state are primarily for the state to guard and protect.</p>
<p id="fbd5b19d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lochner v. New York thus announced three themes that were followed until 1937: Freedom of contract was a right protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; the government could interfere with freedom of contract only to serve a valid police purpose of protecting public health, public safety, or public morals; and the judiciary would carefully scrutinize legislation to ensure that it truly served such a police purpose. This is classic substantive due process: The Due Process Clause was used not to ensure that the government followed proper procedures but to ensure that laws served an adequate purpose. The Court scrutinized both the ends served by the legislation, to ensure that there really was a valid police purpose, and the means, for the law to sufficiently achieve its purported goal.</p>
<p id="fbd5b19e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the next three decades, the Court followed the principles articulated in <i>Lochner</i>, finding many laws unconstitutional as interfering with freedom of contract.

<p id="fbd5b1a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the early part of the twentieth century, as workers attempted to unionize, many states and the federal government adopted laws to facilitate unionization by prohibiting employers from insisting, as a condition of employment, that employees agree not to join a union. The Supreme Court declared the laws unconstitutional as impermissibly infringing freedom of contract. In Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908), the Court declared unconstitutional such a federal law and said in an opinion by Justice Harlan, “While, as already suggested, the right of liberty and property guaranteed by the Constitution against deprivation without due process of law is subject to such reasonable restraints as the common good or the general welfare may require, it is not within the functions of government—at least, in the absence of contract between the parties—to compel any person in the course of his business and against his will to accept or retain the personal services of another, or to compel any person, against his will, to perform personal services for another. The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell it. So the right of the employee to quit the service of the employer, for whatever reason, is the same as the right of the employer, for whatever reason, to dispense with the services of such employee.”</p>
<p id="fbd5d8b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), the Court declared unconstitutional a state law and in an opinion by Justice Pitney stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbd5d8b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Granted the equal freedom of both parties to the contract of employment, has not each party the right to stipulate upon what terms only he will consent to the inception, or to the continuance, of that relationship? And may he not insist upon an express agreement, instead of leaving the terms of the employment to be implied? Supposing an employer is unwilling to have in his employ one holding membership in a labor union, and has reason to suppose that the man may prefer membership in the union to the given employment without it—we ask, can the legislature oblige the employer in such case to refrain from dealing frankly at the outset? Approaching the matter from a somewhat different standpoint, is the employee’s right to be free to join a labor union any more sacred, or more securely founded upon the Constitution, than his right to work for whom he will, or to be idle if he will?</p>

<p id="fbd5d8b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These queries answer themselves. The answers, as we think, lead to a single conclusion: Under constitutional freedom of contract, whatever either party has the right to treat as sufficient ground for terminating the employment, where there is no stipulation on the subject, he has the right to provide against by insisting that a stipulation respecting it shall be a sine qua non of the inception of the employment, or of its continuance if it be terminable at will.</p>
<p id="fbd5d8b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Included in the right of personal liberty and the right of private property— partaking of the nature of each—is the right to make contracts for the acquisition of property. Chief among such contracts is that of personal employment, by which labor and other services are exchanged for money or other forms of property. <span title="593" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-593">p. 593</span>If this right be struck down or arbitrarily interfered with, there is a substantial impairment of liberty in the long-established constitutional sense. The right is as essential to the laborer as to the capitalist, to the poor as to the rich; for the vast majority of persons have no other honest way to begin to acquire property, save by working for money.</p>
<p id="fbd5d8b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An interference with this liberty so serious as that now under consideration, and so disturbing of equality of right, must be deemed to be arbitrary, unless it be supportable as a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state.

<p id="fbd5d8b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To ask a man to agree, in advance, to refrain from affiliation with the union while retaining a certain position of employment, is not to ask him to give up any part of his constitutional freedom.

The Court’s opinion in <i>Lochner</i> distinguished Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 (1898), in which the Court had upheld a maximum hours law for coal miners. The legislature sought to protect the health of miners by limiting their exposure to coal dust.

After <i>Lochner</i> held that there had to be proof that a law was closely related to advancing public health, public safety, or public morals, attorneys began filing detailed briefs, filled with social science data, seeking to show the need for the law. Often termed the “Brandeis brief” because of what Louis Brandeis filed in <i>Muller</i>, these documents used social science data to demonstrate the need for a particular law.</p>

<p id="fbd5ffd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 19, 1903, the legislature of the state of Oregon passed an act, the first section of which is in these words:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbd5ffd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sec. 1. That no female (shall) be employed in any mechanical establishment, or factory, or laundry in this state more than ten hours during any one day. The hours of work may be so arranged as to permit the employment of females at any time so that they shall not work more than ten hours during the twenty-four hours of any one day.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbd5ffd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The single question is the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was convicted, so far as it affects the work of a female in a laundry. <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>It may not be amiss, in the present case, before examining the constitutional question, to notice the course of legislation, as well as expressions of opinion from other than judicial sources. In the brief filed by Mr. Louis D. Brandeis for the defendant in error is a very copious collection of all these matters. [The brief presents] extracts from over ninety reports of committees, bureaus of statistics, commissioners of hygiene, inspectors of factories, both in this country and in Europe, to the effect that long hours of labor are dangerous for women, primarily because of their special physical organization. The matter is discussed in these reports in different aspects, but all agree as to the danger. It would, of course, take too much space to give these reports in detail. Perhaps the general scope and character of all these reports may be summed up in what an inspector for Hanover says: “The reasons for the reduction of the working day to ten hours—(a) the physical organization of women, (b) her maternal functions, (c) the rearing and education of the children, (d) the maintenance of the home—are all so important and so far reaching that the need for such reduction need hardly be discussed.”</p>
<p id="fbd5ffd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undoubtedly true, as more than once declared by this court, that the general right to contract in relation to one’s business is part of the liberty of the individual, protected by the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution; yet it is equally well settled that this liberty is not absolute and extending to all contracts, and that a state may, without conflicting with the provisions of the 14th Amendment, restrict in many respects the individual’s power of contract.</p>
<p id="fbd5ffd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That woman’s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and, as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.</p>
<p id="fbd626e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still again, history discloses the fact that woman has always been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset by superior physical strength. [T]his control in various forms, with diminishing intensity, has continued to the present. As minors, though not to the same extent, she has been looked upon in the courts as needing especial care that her rights may be preserved. Education was long denied her, and while now the doors of the schoolroom are opened and her opportunities for acquiring knowledge are great, yet even with that and the consequent increase of capacity for business affairs it is still true that in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother. Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights. She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right. Doubtless there are individual exceptions, and there are many respects in which she has an advantage over him; but looking at it from the viewpoint of the effort to maintain an independent position in life, she is not upon an equality. Differentiated by these matters from the other sex, she is properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men, and could not be sustained.</p>
<p id="fbd626e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span>It is impossible to close one’s eyes to the fact that she still looks to her brother and depends upon him. Even though all restrictions on political, personal, and contractual rights were taken away, and she stood, so far as statutes are concerned, upon an absolutely equal plane with him, it would still be true that she is so constituted that she will rest upon and look to him for protection; that her physical structure and a proper discharge of her maternal functions—having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race—justify legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man. The limitations which this statute places upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor, are not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all. Many words cannot make this plainer. The two sexes differ in structure of body, in the functions to be performed by each, in the amount of physical strength, in the capacity for long continued labor, particularly when done standing, the influence of vigorous health upon the future well-being of the race, the self-reliance which enables one to assert full rights, and in the capacity to maintain the struggle for subsistence. This difference justifies a difference in legislation, and upholds that which is designed to compensate for some of the burdens which rest upon her.</p>

<p id="fbd64e06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute now under consideration is attacked upon the ground that it authorizes an unconstitutional interference with the freedom of contract included within the guaranties of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. That the right to contract about one’s affairs is a part of the liberty of the individual protected by this clause is settled by the decisions of this court and is no longer open to question. Within this liberty are contracts of employment of labor. In making such contracts, generally speaking, the parties have an equal right to obtain from each other the best terms they can as the result of private bargaining.</p>
<p id="fbd64e07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-596">p. 596</span>There is, of course, no such thing as absolute freedom of contract. It is subject to a great variety of restraints. But freedom of contract is, nevertheless, the general rule and restraint the exception, and the exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances. Whether these circumstances exist in the present case constitutes the question to be answered.</p>
<p id="fbd64e08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he ancient inequality of the sexes, otherwise than physical, as suggested in the Muller Case has continued “with diminishing intensity.” In view of the great—not to say revolutionary—changes which have taken place since that utterance, in the contractual, political, and civil status of women, culminating in the Nineteenth Amendment, it is not unreasonable to say that these differences have now come almost, if not quite, to the vanishing point. In this aspect of the matter, while the physical differences must be recognized in appropriate cases, and legislation fixing hours or conditions of work may properly take them into account, we cannot accept the doctrine that women of mature age require or may be subjected to restrictions upon their liberty of contract which could not lawfully be imposed in the case of men under similar circumstances. To do so would be to ignore all the implications to be drawn from the present day trend of legislation, as well as that of common thought and usage, by which woman is accorded emancipation from the old doctrine that she must be given special protection or be subjected to special restraint in her contractual and civil relationships. In passing, it may be noted that the instant statute applies in the case of a woman employer contracting with a woman employee as it does when the former is a man.</p>
<p id="fbd64e09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is sufficient to supply the necessary cost of living for a woman worker and maintain her in good health and protect her morals is obviously not a precise or unvarying sum—not even approximately so. The amount will depend upon a variety of circumstances: The individual temperament, habits of thrift, care, ability to buy necessaries intelligently, and whether the woman live alone or with her family. To those who practice economy, a given sum will afford comfort, while to those of contrary habit the same sum will be wholly inadequate. The relation between earnings and morals is not capable of standardization. It cannot be shown that well-paid women safeguard their morals more carefully than those who are poorly paid. Morality rests upon other considerations than wages, and there is, certainly, no such prevalent connection between the two as to justify a broad attempt to adjust the latter with reference to the former. As a means of safeguarding morals the attempted classification, in our opinion, is without reasonable basis.</p>
<p id="fbd64e0a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law takes account of the necessities of only one party to the contract. It ignores the necessities of the employer by compelling him to pay not less than a certain sum, not only whether the employee is capable of earning it, but irrespective of the ability of his business to sustain the burden, generously leaving him, of course, the privilege of abandoning his business as an alternative for going on at a loss.</p>
<p id="fbd64e0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law is not confined to the great and powerful employers but embraces those whose bargaining power may be as weak as that of the employee. It takes no account of periods of stress and business depression, of crippling losses, which may leave the employer himself without adequate means of livelihood. To the extent that the sum fixed exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of a <span title="597" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-597">p. 597</span>partially indigent person, for whose condition there rests upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect, arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.</p>
<p id="fbd64e0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The feature of this statute, which perhaps more than any other, puts upon it the stamp of invalidity, is that it exacts from the employer an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with his business, or the contract or the work the employee engages to do. It follows, from what has been said, that the act in question passes the limit prescribed by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbd64e0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court reaffirmed <i>Adkins</i> in 1936, in Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587 (1936), which also declared unconstitutional a state minimum wage law for women. In <i>Morehead</i>, as in <i>Adkins</i>, the Court found that the minimum wage law impermissibly interfered with freedom of contract because it did not serve a valid state police purpose.</p>

<p id="fbd67526-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Butler</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbd67527-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question for decision is whether the provision purporting absolutely to forbid the use of shoddy in comfortables violates the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fbd67528-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee makes approximately 3,000,000 comfortables [bedcovers] annually, and about 750,000 of these are filled with materials defined by the act as shoddy. New material from which appellee makes shoddy consists of clippings and pieces of new cloth obtained from cutting tables in garment factories; secondhand shoddy is made of secondhand garments, rags, and the like. Comfortables made of secondhand shoddy sell at lower prices than those filled with other materials.</p>
<p id="fbd67529-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no controversy between the parties as to whether shoddy may be rendered harmless by disinfection or sterilization. While it is sometimes made from filthy rags, and from other materials that have been exposed to infection, it stands undisputed that all dangers to health may be eliminated by appropriate treatment at low cost.</p>
<p id="fbd6752a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no evidence that any sickness or disease was ever caused by the use of shoddy, and the record contains persuasive evidence, and by citation discloses the opinions of scientists eminent in fields related to public health that the transmission of disease-producing bacteria is almost entirely by immediate contact with, or close proximity to, infected persons; that such bacteria perish rapidly when separated from human or animal organisms; and that there is no probability that such bacteria or vermin likely to carry them survive after the period usually required for the gathering of the materials, the production of shoddy, and the manufacture and the shipping of comfortables. This evidence tends strongly to show that in the absence of sterilization or disinfection there <span title="598" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-598">p. 598</span>would be little, if any, danger to the health of the users of comfortables filled with shoddy, new or secondhand; and confirms the conclusion that all danger from the use of shoddy may be eliminated by sterilization.</p>
<p id="fbd6752b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here it is established that sterilization eliminates the dangers, if any, from the use of shoddy. As against that fact, the provision in question cannot be sustained as a measure to protect health; and the fact that the act permits the use of numerous materials, prescribing sterilization if they are secondhand, also serves to show that the prohibition of the use of shoddy, new or old, even when sterilized, is unreasonable and arbitrary.</p>
<p id="fbd6752c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Holmes</span> (dissenting).</p>
<p id="fbd69c3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Legislature of Pennsylvania was of opinion that disease is likely to be spread by the use of unsterilized shoddy in comfortables I do not suppose that this Court would pronounce the opinion so manifestly absurd that it could not be acted upon. If we should not, then I think that we ought to assume the opinion to be right for the purpose of testing the law. The Legislature may have been of opinion further that the actual practice of filling comfortables with unsterilized shoddy gathered from filthy floors was wide spread, and this again we must assume to be true. It is admitted to be impossible to distinguish the innocent from the infected product in any practicable way, when it is made up into the comfortables. On these premises, if the Legislature regarded the danger as very great and inspection and tagging as inadequate remedies, it seems to me that in order to prevent the spread of disease it constitutionally could forbid any use of shoddy for bedding and upholstery.</p>
<p id="fbd69c3e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another type of consumer protection legislation considered by the Court was price regulations.

<p id="fbd69c43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, toward the end of the <i>Lochner</i> era, in 1934, the Court upheld price regulations for milk in Nebbia v. New York. In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934), the Supreme Court upheld a New York law that set prices for milk. On the one hand, this can be viewed as a narrow decision based on strong evidence of the importance of milk and a legislative finding that “the evils [in the market] . . . could not be expected to right themselves through the ordinary play of the forces of supply and demand, owing to the peculiar and uncontrollable factors affecting the industry.” Although, as discussed above, the <i>Lochner</i> Court had invalidated some price controls, it had upheld others in businesses that it deemed to affect the public interest. <i>Nebbia</i> might be seen as a limited ruling following those cases.</p>
<p id="fbd69c44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>Yet the language of the Court’s opinion in <i>Nebbia</i> was broader than that; the Court seemed to question the basic premises of the <i>Lochner</i> era. The Court said, for example, “But neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute; for government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows, or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm. . . . [T]his court from the early days [has] affirmed that the power to promote the general welfare is inherent in government.” The Court went even further in declaring a need for judicial deference to legislative choices: “So far as the requirement of due process is concerned and in the absence of other constitutional restraints, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose. The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it.” In other words, in <i>Nebbia</i>, the Court appeared to question the premises of the <i>Lochner</i> era that the government only could regulate to achieve a police purpose and that the Court needed to review laws aggressively to ensure that they truly served a police purpose.</p>

<p id="fbd6c359-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the mid-1930s, enormous pressures were mounting for the Court to abandon the laissez-faire philosophy of the <i>Lochner</i> era. The Depression created a widespread perception that government economic regulations were essential. With millions unemployed and with wages incredibly low for those with jobs, employees had no realistic chance of bargaining in the workplace.</p>
<p id="fbd6c35a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intellectual foundations of the <i>Lochner</i> era also were under attack. <i>Lochner</i> rested on the assumption that freedom of contract and related property rights were part of the natural liberties possessed by individuals. Legal realists attacked this premise and persuasively argued that the law reflected political choices; using freedom of contract to invalidate state laws was a political choice that favored employers over employees and corporations over consumers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10437_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10437_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span> As such, the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Lochner</i> and its progeny could not be regarded as “restoring the natural order which had been upset by the legislature . . .

<p id="fbd6ea7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question of the constitutional validity of the minimum wage law of the state of Washington. The act, entitled “Minimum Wages for Women,” authorizes the fixing of minimum wages for women and minors.</p>
<p id="fbd6ea7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant conducts a hotel. The appellee Elsie Parrish was employed as a chambermaid and (with her husband) brought this suit to recover the difference between the wages paid her and the minimum wage fixed pursuant to the state law. The minimum wage was $14.50 per week of 48 hours. The appellant challenged the act as repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="fbd7118c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The importance of the question, in which many states having similar laws are concerned, the close division by which the decision in the <i>Adkins</i> case was reached, and the economic conditions which have supervened, and in the light of which the reasonableness of the exercise of the protective power of the state must be considered, make it not only appropriate, but we think imperative, that in deciding the present case the subject should receive fresh consideration.</p>
<p id="fbd7118d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract. What is this freedom? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation, the Constitution does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty. Liberty in each of its phases has its history and connotation. <span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Constitution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of due process, and regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process.</p>
<p id="fbd7118e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This power under the Constitution to restrict freedom of contract has had many illustrations. That it may be exercised in the public interest with respect to contracts between employer and employee is undeniable. In dealing with the relation of employer and employed, the Legislature has necessarily a wide field of discretion in order that there may be suitable protection of health and safety, and that peace and good order may be promoted through regulations designed to insure wholesome conditions of work and freedom from oppression.</p>
<p id="fbd7118f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that the decision in the <i>Adkins</i> case was a departure from the true application of the principles governing the regulation by the state of the relation of employer and employed. With full recognition of the earnestness and vigor which characterize the prevailing opinion in the <i>Adkins</i> case, we find it impossible to reconcile that ruling with these well-considered declarations. What can be closer to the public interest than the health of women and their protection from unscrupulous and overreaching employers? And if the protection of women is a legitimate end of the exercise of state power, how can it be said that the requirement of the payment of a minimum wage fairly fixed in order to meet the very necessities of existence is not an admissible means to that end? The Legislature of the state was clearly entitled to consider the situation of women in employment, the fact that they are in the class receiving the least pay, that their bargaining power is relatively weak, and that they are the ready victims of those who would take advantage of their necessitous circumstances. The Legislature was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the “sweating system,” the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living, thus making their very helplessness the occasion of a most injurious competition. The Legislature had the right to consider that its minimum wage requirements would be an important aid in carrying out its policy of protection. The adoption of similar requirements by many states evidences a deepseated conviction both as to the presence of the evil and as to the means adapted to check it. Legislative response to that conviction cannot be regarded as arbitrary or capricious and that is all we have to decide. Even if the wisdom of the policy be regarded as debatable and its effects uncertain, still the Legislature is entitled to its judgment.</p>
<p id="fbd71190-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an additional and compelling consideration which recent economic experience has brought into a strong light. The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power and are thus relatively defenseless against the denial of a living wage is not only detrimental to their health and well being, but casts a direct burden for their support upon the community. What these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to pay. The bare cost of living must be met. We may take judicial notice of the unparalleled demands for relief which arose during the recent period of depression and still continue to an alarming extent despite the degree of economic recovery which has been achieved. It is unnecessary to cite official statistics to establish what is of common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land. While in the instant case no factual brief has been presented, there is no reason to doubt that the state of Washington has encountered the same <span title="602" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-602">p. 602</span>social problem that is present elsewhere. The community is not bound to provide what is in effect a subsidy for unconscionable employers. The community may direct its law-making power to correct the abuse which springs from their selfish disregard of the public interest.</p>

Parrish, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding and the new policy of judicial deference to government economic regulations. In United States v. Carolene Products Co., below, the Court upheld the Filled Milk Act of 1923 that prohibited “filled milk,” a substance obtained by mixing milk and vegetable oil. <i>Carolene Products</i> is perhaps most famous for a footnote within it—footnote 4—that proclaims a need for judicial deference to government economic regulations, with more aggressive judicial review reserved for cases involving fundamental rights and “discrete and insular minorities.”</p>

<p id="fbd738a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stone</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbd738a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question for decision is whether the “Filled Milk Act” of Congress of March 4, 1923, which prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat, so as to resemble milk or cream, infringes the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbd738a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee was indicted in the District Court for Southern Illinois for violation of the act by the shipment in interstate commerce of certain packages of “Milnut,” a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream. The indictment states, in the words of the statute, that Milnut “is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health,” and that it is not a prepared food product of the type excepted from the prohibition of the act.</p>
<p id="fbd738aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prohibition of shipment of appellee’s product in interstate commerce does not infringe the Fifth Amendment. Twenty years ago this Court, in Hebe Co. v. Shaw, held that a state law which forbids the manufacture and sale of a product assumed to be wholesome and nutritive, made of condensed skimmed milk, compounded with coconut oil, is not forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. The power of the Legislature to secure a minimum of particular nutritive elements in a widely used article of food and to protect the public from fraudulent substitutions, was not doubted; and the Court thought that there was ample scope for the legislative judgment that prohibition of the offending article was an appropriate means of preventing injury to the public.</p>
<p id="fbd738ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no persuasive reason for departing from that ruling here, where the Fifth Amendment is concerned; and since none is suggested, we might rest decision wholly on the presumption of constitutionality. But affirmative evidence also sustains the statute. In twenty years evidence has steadily accumulated of the danger to the public health from the general consumption of foods which have been stripped of elements essential to the maintenance of health. The Filled Milk Act was adopted by Congress after committee hearings, in the course of which eminent scientists and health experts testified. An extensive investigation <span title="603" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-603">p. 603</span>was made of the commerce in milk compounds in which vegetable oils have been substituted for natural milk fat, and of the effect upon the public health of the use of such compounds as a food substitute for milk. There is nothing in the Constitution which compels a Legislature, either national or state, to ignore such evidence, nor need it disregard the other evidence which amply supports the conclusions of the Congressional committees that the danger is greatly enhanced where an inferior product, like appellee’s, is indistinguishable from a valuable food of almost universal use, thus making fraudulent distribution easy and protection of the consumer difficult.</p>

But by their very nature such inquiries, where the legislative judgment is drawn in question, must be restricted to the issue whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it.</p>
<p id="fbd738b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here the demurrer challenges the validity of the statute on its face and it is evident from all the considerations presented to Congress, and those of which we may take judicial notice, that the question is at least debatable whether commerce in filled milk should be left unregulated, or in some measure restricted, or wholly prohibited. As that decision was for Congress, neither the finding of a court arrived at by weighing the evidence, nor the verdict of a jury can be substituted for it.</p>

<p id="fbd75fc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since 1937, not one state or federal economic regulation has been found unconstitutional as infringing liberty of contract as protected by the Due <span title="604" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-604">p. 604</span>Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court has made it clear that economic regulations—laws regulating business and employment practices—will be upheld when challenged under the Due Process Clause as long as they are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.</p>
<p id="fbd75fc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government’s purpose can be any goal not prohibited by the Constitution. In fact, it does not need to be proven that the asserted purpose was the legislature’s actual objective. Any conceivable purpose is sufficient.

<p id="fbd786dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbd786dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This suit was instituted in the District Court to have an Oklahoma law declared unconstitutional and to enjoin state officials from enforcing it, for the reason that it allegedly violated various provisions of the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbd786de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court held unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment the portions of §2 which make it unlawful for any person not a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist to fit lenses to a face or to duplicate or replace into frames lenses or other optical appliances, except upon written prescriptive authority of an Oklahoma licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist.</p>
<p id="fbd786df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An ophthalmologist is a duly licensed physician who specializes in the care of the eyes. An optometrist examines eyes for refractive error, recognizes (but does not treat) diseases of the eye, and fills prescriptions for eyeglasses. The optician is an artisan qualified to grind lenses, fill prescriptions, and fit frames.</p>
<p id="fbd786e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect of §2 is to forbid the optician from fitting or duplicating lenses without a prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. In practical effect, it means that no optician can fit old glasses into new frames or supply a lens, whether it be a new lens or one to duplicate a lost or broken lens, without a prescription. The District Court conceded that it was in the competence of the police power of a State to regulate the examination of the eyes. But it rebelled at the notion that a State could require a prescription from an optometrist or ophthalmologist “to take old lenses and place them in new frames and then fit the completed spectacles to the face of the eyeglass wearer.” It held that such a requirement was not “reasonably and rationally related to the health and welfare of the people.” The court found that through mechanical devices and ordinary skills the optician could take a broken lens or a fragment thereof, measure its power, and reduce it to prescriptive terms.</p>
<p id="fbd786e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Oklahoma law may exact a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases. But it is for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement. It appears that in many cases the optician can easily supply the new frames or new lenses without reference to the old written prescription. It also appears that many written prescriptions contain no <span title="605" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-605">p. 605</span>directive data in regard to fitting spectacles to the face. But in some cases the directions contained in the prescription are essential, if the glasses are to be fitted so as to correct the particular defects of vision or alleviate the eye condition. The legislature might have concluded that the frequency of occasions when a prescription is necessary was sufficient to justify this regulation of the fitting of eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="fbd786e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, when it is necessary to duplicate a lens, a written prescription may or may not be necessary. But the legislature might have concluded that one was needed often enough to require one in every case. Or the legislature may have concluded that eye examinations were so critical, not only for correction of vision but also for detection of latent ailments or diseases, that every change in frames and every duplication of a lens should be accompanied by a prescription from a medical expert. To be sure, the present law does not require a new examination of the eyes every time the frames are changed or the lenses duplicated. For if the old prescription is on file with the optician, he can go ahead and make the new fitting or duplicate the lenses. But the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.</p>
<p id="fbd786e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought. See Nebbia v. People of State of New York; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish. We emphasize again what Chief Justice Waite said in Munn v. State of Illinois, “For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls, not to the courts.”</p>
<p id="fbd786e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several other cases, like <i>Williamson</i>, reveal how unlikely it is that any economic regulation will be found to violate due process. In Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525 (1949), the Court unanimously upheld a state “right to work” law, which mandated that no person could be denied a job for failure to join a union. The Court stressed that it had long repudiated the “<i>Allgeyer</i>-<i>Lochner</i>-<i>Adair</i>-<i>Coppage</i> constitutional doctrine.” The Court said that states could legislate against “injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition, or of some valid federal law.”</p>
<p id="fbd786e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726 (1963), the Court upheld a Kansas law that made it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of debt adjusting, except incident to the practice of law. A debt adjustor would make a deal with a debtor to pay money to the adjustor on a regular basis, and the adjustor would then distribute it to the debtor’s creditors based on an agreed-on plan. The effect of the Kansas law was to put debt adjusters, who were not lawyers, out of business.</p>
<p id="fbd7acf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Black, writing for the Court, said, “Under the system of government created by our Constitution, it is up to legislatures, not courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation. There was a time when the Due Process Clause was used by this Court to strike down laws which were thought unreasonable, that is, unwise or incompatible with some particular economic or social philosophy. . . . [That doctrine] has long since been discarded. . . . It is now settled that States have power to legislate against what are found to be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition, or some valid federal law.”</p>
<p id="fbd7acf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="606" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-606">p. 606</span><i>Ferguson</i> shows that the Court no longer interpreted the Due Process Clause to protect a right to practice a trade or profession or even freedom of contract. The Kansas law undoubtedly was an anticompetitive measure to give lawyers a monopoly in debt adjustments. Nonetheless, the Court proclaimed deference to the legislature and upheld the law.</p>

TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp. (1993). The wrongdoing involved in this case was the decision by a national distributor of automobiles not to advise its dealers, and hence their customers, of predelivery damage to new cars when the cost of repair amounted to less than 3 percent of the car’s suggested retail price. The question presented is whether a $2 million punitive damages award to the purchaser of one of these cars exceeds the constitutional limit.</p>

<p id="fbd7d413-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1990, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr. (respondent), purchased a black BMW sports sedan for $40,750.88 from an authorized BMW dealer in Birmingham, Alabama. After driving the car for approximately nine months, and without noticing any flaws in its appearance, Dr. Gore took the car to “Slick Finish,” an independent detailer, to make it look “‘snazzier than it normally would appear.’” Mr. Slick, the proprietor, detected evidence that the car had been repainted. Convinced that he had been cheated, Dr. Gore brought suit against petitioner BMW of North America (BMW), the American distributor of BMW automobiles. Dr. Gore alleged that the failure to disclose that the car had been repainted constituted suppression of a material fact. The complaint prayed for $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, and costs.</p>
<p id="fbd7d414-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, BMW acknowledged that it had adopted a nationwide policy in 1983 concerning cars that were damaged in the course of manufacture or transportation. If the cost of repairing the damage exceeded 3 percent of the car’s <span title="607" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-607">p. 607</span>suggested retail price, the car was placed in company service for a period of time and then sold as used. If the repair cost did not exceed 3 percent of the suggested retail price, however, the car was sold as new without advising the dealer that any repairs had been made. Because the $601.37 cost of repainting Dr. Gore’s car was only about 1.5 percent of its suggested retail price, BMW did not disclose the damage or repair to the Birmingham dealer.</p>
<p id="fbd7d415-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Gore asserted that his repainted car was worth less than a car that had not been refinished. To prove his actual damages of $4,000, he relied on the testimony of a former BMW dealer, who estimated that the value of a repainted BMW was approximately 10 percent less than the value of a new car that had not been damaged and repaired. To support his claim for punitive damages, Dr. Gore introduced evidence that since 1983 BMW had sold 983 refinished cars as new, including 14 in Alabama, without disclosing that the cars had been repainted before sale at a cost of more than $300 per vehicle. Using the actual damage estimate of $4,000 per vehicle, Dr. Gore argued that a punitive award of $4 million would provide an appropriate penalty for selling approximately 1,000 cars for more than they were worth.</p>
<p id="fbd7d416-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury returned a verdict finding BMW liable for compensatory damages of $4,000. In addition, the jury assessed $4 million in punitive damages, based on a determination that the nondisclosure policy constituted “gross, oppressive or malicious” fraud.</p>
<p id="fbd7d417-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court also rejected BMW’s claim that the award exceeded the constitutionally permissible amount. The Alabama Supreme Court did, however, rule in BMW’s favor on one critical point: The court found that the jury improperly computed the amount of punitive damages by multiplying Dr. Gore’s compensatory damages by the number of similar sales in other jurisdictions. Having found the verdict tainted, the court held that “a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in this case is $2,000,000,” and therefore ordered a remittitur in that amount.</p>

<p id="fbd7fb29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition. In our federal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case. Most States that authorize exemplary damages afford the jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damages awarded be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State’s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.</p>
<p id="fbd7fb2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Only when an award can fairly be categorized as “grossly excessive” in relation to these interests does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For that reason, the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins with an identification of the state interests that a punitive award is designed to serve. We therefore focus our attention first on the scope of Alabama’s legitimate interests in punishing BMW and deterring it from future misconduct.</p>

But the States need not, and in fact do not, provide such protection in a uniform manner.</p>
<p id="fbd7fb2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We may assume, arguendo, that it would be wise for every State to adopt Dr. Gore’s preferred rule, requiring full disclosure of every presale repair to a car, no matter how trivial and regardless of its actual impact on the value of the car. But while we do not doubt that Congress has ample authority to enact such a policy for the entire Nation, it is clear that no single State could do so, or even impose its own policy choice on neighboring States. Similarly, one State’s power to impose burdens on the interstate market for automobiles is not only subordinate to the federal power over interstate commerce, Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), but is also constrained by the need to respect the interests of other States.</p>
<p id="fbd7fb2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it follows from these principles of state sovereignty and comity that a State may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors’ lawful conduct in other States. Before this Court Dr. Gore argued that the large punitive damages award was necessary to induce BMW to change the nationwide policy that it adopted in 1983. But by attempting to alter BMW’s nationwide policy, Alabama would be infringing on the policy choices of other States. To avoid such encroachment, the economic penalties that a State such as Alabama inflicts on those who transgress its laws, whether the penalties take the form of legislatively authorized fines or judicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported by the State’s interest in protecting its own consumers and its own economy. Alabama may insist that BMW adhere to a particular disclosure policy in that State. Alabama does not have the power, however, to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its residents. Nor may Alabama impose sanctions on BMW in order to deter conduct that is lawful in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p id="fbd7fb2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose. Three guideposts, each of which indicates that BMW did not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose for adhering to the nondisclosure policy adopted in 1983, lead us to the conclusion that the $2 million award against BMW is grossly excessive: the degree of reprehensibility of the nondisclosure; the disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered by Dr. Gore and his punitive damages award; and the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.</p>

<p id="fbd7fb31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct. As the Court stated nearly 150 years ago, exemplary damages imposed on a defendant should reflect “the enormity of his offense.” Day v. Woodworth (1852).</p>
<p id="fbd7fb32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-609">p. 609</span>In this case, none of the aggravating factors associated with particularly reprehensible conduct is present. The harm BMW inflicted on Dr. Gore was purely economic in nature. The presale refinishing of the car had no effect on its performance or safety features, or even its appearance for at least nine months after his purchase. BMW’s conduct evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the health and safety of others. To be sure, infliction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through affirmative acts of misconduct, or when the target is financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty. But this observation does not convert all acts that cause economic harm into torts that are sufficiently reprehensible to justify a significant sanction in addition to compensatory damages.</p>

<p id="fbd82244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff. The principle that exemplary damages must bear a “reasonable relationship” to compensatory damages has a long pedigree.</p>
<p id="fbd82245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Pacific Mutual Insurance v. Haslip (1991) we concluded that even though a punitive damages award of “more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages” might be “close to the line,” it did not “cross the line into the area of constitutional impropriety.” TXO v. Alliance Resource Corp. (1993), following dicta in <i>Haslip</i>, refined this analysis by confirming that the proper inquiry is “‘whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.’”</p>
<p id="fbd82246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The $2 million in punitive damages awarded to Dr. Gore by the Alabama Supreme Court is 500 times the amount of his actual harm as determined by the jury. Moreover, there is no suggestion that Dr. Gore or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm by BMW’s nondisclosure policy. The disparity in this case is thus dramatically greater than those considered in <i>Haslip</i> and <i>TXO</i>. In most cases, the ratio will be within a constitutionally acceptable range, and remittitur will not be justified on this basis. When the ratio is a breathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely “raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow.”</p>

<p id="fbd82248-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comparing the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct provides a third indicium of excessiveness. In this case the $2 million economic sanction imposed on BMW is substantially greater than the statutory fines available in Alabama and elsewhere for similar malfeasance.</p>
<p id="fbd82249-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The maximum civil penalty authorized by the Alabama Legislature for a violation of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act is $2,000; other States authorize more severe sanctions, with the maxima ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. None of these statutes would provide an out-of-state distributor with fair notice that the first violation—or, indeed the first 14 violations—of its provisions might subject an offender to a multimillion dollar penalty. Moreover, at the time BMW’s policy was first challenged, there does not appear to have been any judicial decision in Alabama or elsewhere indicating that application of that policy might give rise to such severe punishment.</p>
<p id="fbd8224a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="610" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-610">p. 610</span>The sanction imposed in this case cannot be justified on the ground that it was necessary to deter future misconduct without considering whether less drastic remedies could be expected to achieve that goal. The fact that a multimillion dollar penalty prompted a change in policy sheds no light on the question whether a lesser deterrent would have adequately protected the interests of Alabama consumers. We are fully convinced that the grossly excessive award imposed in this case transcends the constitutional limit.</p>

<p id="fbd8224c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today we see the latest manifestation of this Court’s recent and increasingly insistent “concern about punitive damages that ‘run wild.’” Since the Constitution does not make that concern any of our business, the Court’s activities in this area are an unjustified incursion into the province of state governments.</p>
<p id="fbd8495d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In earlier cases that were the prelude to this decision, I set forth my view that a state trial procedure that commits the decision whether to impose punitive damages, and the amount, to the discretion of the jury, subject to some judicial review for “reasonableness,” furnishes a defendant with all the process that is “due.” I do not regard the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause as a secret repository of substantive guarantees against “unfairness”—neither the unfairness of an excessive civil compensatory award, nor the unfairness of an “unreasonable” punitive award. What the Fourteenth Amendment’s procedural guarantee assures is an opportunity to contest the reasonableness of a damages judgment in state court; but there is no federal guarantee a damages award actually be reasonable. This view, which adheres to the text of the Due Process Clause, has not prevailed in our punitive damages cases. When, however, a constitutional doctrine adopted by the Court is not only mistaken but also insusceptible of principled application, I do not feel bound to give it stare decisis effect—indeed, I do not feel justified in doing so.</p>
<p id="fbd8495e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our punitive damages jurisprudence compels such a response. The Constitution provides no warrant for federalizing yet another aspect of our Nation’s legal culture (no matter how much in need of correction it may be), and the application of the Court’s new rule of constitutional law is constrained by no principle other than the Justices’ subjective assessment of the “reasonableness” of the award in relation to the conduct for which it was assessed.</p>
<p id="fbd8495f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the issue has been framed in terms of a constitutional right against unreasonably excessive awards should not obscure the fact that the logical and necessary consequence of the Court’s approach is the recognition of a constitutional right against unreasonably imposed awards as well. The elevation of “fairness” in punishment to a principle of “substantive due process” means that every punitive award unreasonably imposed is unconstitutional; such an award is by definition excessive, since it attaches a penalty to conduct undeserving of punishment. Indeed, if the Court is correct, it must be that every claim that a state jury’s award of compensatory damages is “unreasonable” (because not supported by the evidence) amounts to an assertion of constitutional injury. And the same would be true for determinations of liability. By today’s logic, every dispute as to evidentiary sufficiency in a state civil suit poses a question of constitutional moment, subject to review in this Court. That is a stupefying proposition.</p>

<p id="fbd87078-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah. He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway. Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction. To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher. Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled. The Campbells escaped unscathed.</p>
<p id="fbd87079-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault. Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but “a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbell’s unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.” Campbell’s insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospital’s estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant). State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that “their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.” To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.</p>
<p id="fbd8707a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability. Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells: “‘You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.’” Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him. Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict. During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells. In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slusher’s and Ospital’s attorneys. The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action. No settlement could be concluded without Slusher’s and Ospital’s approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.</p>

State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits. The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. Both parties appealed. The Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.</p>

<p id="fbd8707d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognized in Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (2001), that in our judicial system compensatory and punitive damages, although usually awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker, serve different purposes. Compensatory damages “are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant’s wrongful conduct.” By contrast, punitive damages serve a broader function; they are aimed at deterrence and retribution. While States possess discretion over the imposition of punitive damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor. To the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property. Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding. This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered. We have admonished that “[p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.”</p>
<p id="fbd8707e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these concerns, in BMW v. Gore (1996) we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. We reiterated the importance of these three guideposts in <i>Cooper Industries</i> and mandated appellate courts to conduct de novo review of a trial court’s application of them to the jury’s award. Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an “‘application of law, rather than a decisionmaker’s caprice.’”</p>

<p id="fbd87082-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct.” We have <span title="613" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-613">p. 613</span>instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant’s culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.</p>
<p id="fbd87083-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farm’s handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise. The trial court found that State Farm’s employees altered the company’s records to make Campbell appear less culpable. State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded. State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house. While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farm’s conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the State’s legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.</p>
<p id="fbd87084-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm’s operations throughout the country. The Utah Supreme Court’s opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct directed toward the Campbells. This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial court’s decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.</p>
<p id="fbd89795-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred. Nor, as a general rule, does a State have a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the State’s jurisdiction. Any proper adjudication of conduct that occurred outside Utah to other persons would require their inclusion, and, to those parties, the Utah courts, in the usual case, would need to apply the laws of their relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="fbd89796-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells’ harm. A defendant’s dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages. A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business. Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties’ hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here. Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case non-parties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.</p>
<p id="fbd89797-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Court’s decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist. Although “[o]ur holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance,” in the context of civil actions courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions.</p>
<p id="fbd89798-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them. Nor does our review of the Utah courts’ decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length. For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing. The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period. In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.</p>

We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process. While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State’s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.</p>
<p id="fbd8979b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where “a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.” The converse is also true, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="fbd8979c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered. In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio. The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress. This was complete compensation. The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused <span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-615">p. 615</span>to resolve the claim against them. The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award. Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct. Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.</p>
<p id="fbd8979d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in <i>Gore</i>. The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award. The principles set forth in <i>Gore</i> must be implemented with care, to ensure both reasonableness and proportionality.</p>

<p id="fbd8979f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third guidepost in <i>Gore</i> is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the “civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.” We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed. The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action. When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility. Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof. Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.</p>
<p id="fbd897a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost. The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award. The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farm’s business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct. This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.</p>

The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant. The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.</p>

<p id="fbd8beb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not long ago, this Court was hesitant to impose a federal check on state-court judgments awarding punitive damages. In <i>Gore</i>, I stated why I resisted the Court’s foray into punitive damages “territory traditionally within the States’ domain.” I adhere to those views, and note again that, unlike federal habeas corpus review of state-court convictions under 28 U.S.C. §2254, the Court “work[s] at this business [of checking state courts] alone,” unaided by the participation of federal district courts and courts of appeals. It was once recognized that “the laws of the particular State must suffice [to superintend punitive damages awards] until judges or legislators authorized to do so initiate system-wide change.” I would adhere to that traditional view.</p>
<p id="fbd8beb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The large size of the award upheld by the Utah Supreme Court in this case indicates why damage-capping legislation may be altogether fitting and proper. Neither the amount of the award nor the trial record, however, justifies this Court’s substitution of its judgment for that of Utah’s competent decisionmakers. In this regard, I count it significant that, on the key criterion “reprehensibility,” there is a good deal more to the story than the Court’s abbreviated account tells.</p>
<p id="fbd8beba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ample evidence allowed the jury to find that State Farm’s treatment of the Campbells typified its “Performance, Planning and Review” (PP &amp; R) program; implemented by top management in 1979, the program had “the explicit objective of using the claims-adjustment process as a profit center.” “[T]he Campbells presented considerable evidence,” the trial court noted, documenting “that the PP &amp; R program . . . has functioned, and continues to function, as an unlawful scheme . . . to deny benefits owed consumers by paying out less than fair value in order to meet preset, arbitrary payout targets designed to enhance corporate profits.”</p>
<p id="fbd8bebb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court further determined that the jury could find State Farm’s policy “deliberately crafted” to prey on consumers who would be unlikely to defend themselves. In this regard, the trial court noted the testimony of several former State Farm employees affirming that they were trained to target “the weakest of the herd”—“the elderly, the poor, and other consumers who are least knowledgeable about their rights and thus most vulnerable to trickery or deceit, or who have little money and hence have no real alternative but to accept an inadequate offer to settle a claim at much less than fair value.”</p>
<p id="fbd8bebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To further insulate itself from liability, trial evidence indicated, State Farm made “systematic” efforts to destroy internal company documents that might reveal its scheme, efforts that directly affected the Campbells. [W]hile the Campbells’ case was pending, Janet Cammack, “an in-house attorney sent by top State Farm management, conducted a meeting . . . in Utah during which she instructed Utah claims management to search their offices and destroy a wide <span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-617">p. 617</span>range of material of the sort that had proved damaging in bad-faith litigation in the past—in particular, old claim-handling manuals, memos, claim school notes, procedure guides and other similar documents.”</p>
<p id="fbd8bebd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State Farm’s “policies and practices,” the trial evidence thus bore out, were “responsible for the injuries suffered by the Campbells,” and the means used to implement those policies could be found “callous, clandestine, fraudulent, and dishonest.” The Utah Supreme Court, relying on the trial court’s record-based recitations, understandably characterized State Farm’s behavior as “egregious and malicious.”</p>
<p id="fbd8bebe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Court first ventured to override state-court punitive damages awards, it did so moderately. Today’s decision exhibits no such respect and restraint. No longer content to accord state-court judgments “a strong presumption of validity,” the Court announces that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.” Moreover, the Court adds, when compensatory damages are substantial, doubling those damages “can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.” In a legislative scheme or a state high court’s design to cap punitive damages, the handiwork in setting single-digit and 1-to-1 benchmarks could hardly be questioned; in a judicial decree imposed on the States by this Court under the banner of substantive due process, the numerical controls today’s decision installs seem to me boldly out of order.</p>
<p id="fbd8bebf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I remain of the view that this Court has no warrant to reform state law governing awards of punitive damages. Even if I were prepared to accept the flexible guides prescribed in <i>Gore</i>, I would not join the Court’s swift conversion of those guides into instructions that begin to resemble marching orders.</p>

<p id="fbd8e5d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court returned to the issue of punitive damages in Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 556 U.S. 178 (2009). A jury awarded the widow of a smoker a damage award against a tobacco company of $800,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. The Supreme Court held that this award violated due process because it punished the defendant for harms suffered by individuals other than the plaintiff. Justice Breyer, writing for the Court in a 5-4 decision, stated: “In our view, the Constitution’s Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent, i.e., injury that it inflicts upon those who are, essentially, strangers to the litigation.” This is a new substantive limit on punitive damages: They may be imposed only to punish a defendant for the harms suffered by that plaintiff and not for harms incurred by others who are not part of the litigation.</p>
<p id="fbd8e5d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Court said that a jury in considering the reprehensibility of a defendant’s conduct may consider the extent of harm to third parties. The Court explained: “Respondent argues that she is free to show harm to other victims because it is relevant to a different part of the punitive damages constitutional equation, namely, reprehensibility. That is to say, harm to others shows more reprehensible conduct. Philip Morris, in turn, does not deny that a plaintiff may show harm to others in order to demonstrate reprehensibility. Nor do we. Evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that <span title="618" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-618">p. 618</span>harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible — although counsel may argue in a particular case that conduct resulting in no harm to others nonetheless posed a grave risk to the public, or the converse. Yet for the reasons given above, a jury may not go further than this and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly on account of harms it is alleged to have visited on nonparties.”</p>
<p id="fbd8e5d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although conceptually such a distinction can be drawn, it is likely to cause serious confusion for juries. A jury cannot base its punitive damages on harm to third parties, but it may consider harm to third parties in assessing the reprehensibility of a defendant’s conduct.</p>
<p id="fbd8e5d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court remanded the case to the Oregon courts for reconsideration in light of its decision. The Oregon courts reaffirmed the entire punitive damage award, concluding that the defendant had not properly objected under state law requirements. The Supreme Court once more granted review, but then after oral argument dismissed the case as certiorari having been improvidently granted.</p>

<p id="fbd8e5d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding the use of substantive due process in the punitive damage case presented above, not one law since 1937 has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court as violating economic substantive due process. Ultimately, the question is whether this is appropriate judicial deference to legislative choices in regulating the economy, or whether this constitutes judicial abdication of an important role in protecting economic liberties. Are the decisions since 1937 an overreaction to the <i>Lochner</i>-era decisions? Or do the decisions reflect a properly limited judicial role in scrutinizing economic regulations?</p>
<p id="fbd8e5d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Answering these normative questions requires consideration of whether there should be constitutional protection of economic rights, such as freedom of contract and a right to practice a trade or profession. Also, there must be consideration of the proper judicial role and whether there are reasons why the judiciary should be especially deferential to legislatures in this area.</p>
<p id="fbd8e5d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bottom line is that since 1937 economic substantive due process has been unavailable to challenge government economic and social welfare laws and regulations. Protection of economic rights, since 1937, such that it has been, has come under two specific constitutional provisions: the Contracts Clause of Article I, §10, and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>

In other words, the Contracts Clause does not apply to the federal government; challenges to federal interference with contracts must be brought under the Due Process Clause <span title="619" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-619">p. 619</span>where they will receive the deferential rational basis review described above.

<p id="fbd90cef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Contracts Clause seems to have been motivated by a desire to prevent states from adopting laws to help debtors at the expense of creditors.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107EE_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N107EE_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span> The framers were concerned that in times of recession or depression, state legislatures might adopt laws to protect debtors who were unable to pay what was owed. The Contracts Clause was meant to stop such debtor relief legislation that had the effect of interfering with contractual rights. The goal was not only to protect creditors, but also to encourage credit by assuring lenders that they would be repaid.</p>
<p id="fbd90cf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Court aggressively used the Contracts Clause to invalidate state and local laws that interfered with rights under existing contracts. Although the Contracts Clause continued to be used by the Court in the latter half of the nineteenth century, by the twentieth century the Contracts Clause rarely was mentioned in Supreme Court decisions. During the <i>Lochner</i> era, from about 1897 until 1937, the Contracts Clause was made superfluous by the Court’s protection of freedom of contract under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The freedom of contract protected under these provisions limited both government regulation of future contracts and government interference with existing contracts. Because the Contracts Clause only applies to the latter, preventing impairment of existing contracts, the Court’s use of due process to protect freedom of contract subsumed the content of the Contracts Clause.</p>

The act provides that, during the emergency declared to exist, relief may be had through authorized judicial proceedings with respect to foreclosures of <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>mortgages, and execution sales, of real estate; that sales may be postponed and periods of redemption may be extended.

<p id="fbd9340e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the provision for this temporary and conditional relief exceeds the power of the state by reason of the clause in the Federal Constitution prohibiting impairment of the obligations of contracts, we must consider the relation of emergency to constitutional power, the historical setting of the contract clause, the development of the jurisprudence of this Court in the construction of that clause, and the principles of construction which we may consider to be established.</p>
<p id="fbd9340f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Emergency does not create power. Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency. Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency. What power was thus granted and what limitations were thus imposed are questions which have always been, and always will be, the subject of close examination under our constitutional system.</p>
<p id="fbd93410-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While emergency does not create power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. “Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.” The constitutional question presented in the light of an emergency is whether the power possessed embraces the particular exercise of it in response to particular conditions. Thus, the war power of the federal government is not created by the emergency of war, but it is a power given to meet that emergency.</p>
<p id="fbd93411-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the construction of the Contract Clause, the debates in the Constitutional Convention are of little aid. But the reasons which led to the adoption of that clause, and of the other prohibitions of section 10 of article 1, are not left in doubt, and have frequently been described with eloquent emphasis. The widespread distress following the revolutionary period and the plight of debtors had called forth in the States an ignoble array of legislative schemes for the defeat of creditors and the invasion of contractual obligations. Legislative interferences had been so numerous and extreme that the confidence essential to prosperous trade had been undermined and the utter destruction of credit was threatened.</p>
<p id="fbd93412-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>Not only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the state retains over remedial processes, but the state also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end “has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect.” Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order. The policy of protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worthwhile—a government which retains adequate authority to secure the peace and good order of society. This principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of state power has had progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court. The economic interests of the state may justify the exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts.</p>
<p id="fbd95b23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undoubtedly, whatever is reserved of state power must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power. The reserved power cannot be construed so as to destroy the limitation, nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential aspects. They must be construed in harmony with each other. This principle precludes a construction which would permit the state to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them. But it does not follow that conditions may not arise in which a temporary restraint of enforcement may be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the constitutional provision and thus be found to be within the range of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community. It cannot be maintained that the constitutional prohibition should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity such as fire, flood, or earthquake.</p>
<p id="fbd95b24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reservation of state power appropriate to such extraordinary conditions may be deemed to be as much a part of all contracts as is the reservation of state power to protect the public interest in the other situations to which we have referred. And, if state power exists to give temporary relief from the enforcement of contracts in the presence of disasters due to physical causes such as fire, flood, or earthquake, that power cannot be said to be nonexistent when the urgent public need demanding such relief is produced by other and economic causes.</p>
<p id="fbd95b25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no answer to say that this public need was not apprehended a century ago, or to insist that what the provision of the Constitution meant to the vision of that day it must mean to the vision of our time. If by the statement that what the Constitution meant at the time of its adoption it means today, it is intended to say that the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the framers, with the conditions and outlook of their time, would have placed upon them, the statement carries its own refutation. It was to guard against such a narrow conception that Chief Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning—“We must never forget, that it is a <i>constitution</i> we are expounding” (McCulloch v. Maryland)—“a constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various <i>crises</i> of human affairs.” When we are dealing with the words of the Constitution, “we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. . . .

<p id="fbd95b26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the criteria established by our decisions, we conclude:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="fbd95b27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An emergency existed in Minnesota which furnished a proper occasion for the exercise of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community. The declarations of the existence of this emergency by the Legislature and by the Supreme Court of Minnesota cannot be regarded as a subterfuge or as lacking in adequate basis.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fbd95b28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislation was addressed to a legitimate end; that is, the legislation was not for the mere advantage of particular individuals but for the protection of a basic interest of society.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fbd95b29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the nature of the contracts in question—mortgages of unquestionable validity—the relief afforded and justified by the emergency, in order not to contravene the constitutional provision, could only be of a character appropriate to that emergency, and could be granted only upon reasonable conditions.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fbd95b2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conditions upon which the period of redemption is extended do not appear to be unreasonable. The initial extension of the time of redemption for thirty days from the approval of the act was obviously to give a reasonable opportunity for the authorized application to the court. As already noted, the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness is not impaired; interest continues to run; the validity of the sale and the right of a mortgagee-purchaser to title or to obtain a deficiency judgment, if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the extended period, are maintained; and the conditions of redemption, if redemption there be, stand as they were under the prior law. The mortgagor during the extended period is not ousted from possession, but he must pay the rental value of the premises as ascertained in judicial proceedings and this amount is applied to the carrying of the property and to interest upon the indebtedness.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="fbd95b2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislation is temporary in operation. It is limited to the exigency which called it forth. While the postponement of the period of redemption from the foreclosure sale is to May 1, 1935, that period may be reduced by the order of the court under the statute, in case of a change in circumstances, and the operation of the statute itself could not validly outlast the emergency or be so extended as virtually to destroy the contracts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="fbd95b2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of the opinion that the Minnesota statute as here applied does not violate the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. Whether the legislation is wise or unwise as a matter of policy is a question with which we are not concerned.</p>

<p id="fbd98245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbd98246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the regulation by the State of Kansas of the price of natural gas sold at wellhead in the intrastate market. It presents a federal Contract Clause issue. [A contract for natural gas provided that the price to be paid would be increased if government regulators fixed a higher price than that specified in the contract. Subsequently, Kansas adopted a law that provided that the price to be paid for natural gas under a contract could not be increased because of prices set by federal authorities. The state law prevented the natural gas producer from charging the higher prices that it was entitled to under the contract.]</p>
<p id="fbd98247-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the language of the Contract Clause is facially absolute, its prohibition must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State “to safeguard the vital interests of its people.” Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell (1934).</p>
<p id="fbd98248-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold inquiry is “whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.” Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus (1978). The severity of the impairment is said to increase the level of scrutiny to which the legislation will be subjected. Total destruction of contractual expectations is not necessary for a finding of substantial impairment. On the other hand, state regulation that restricts a party to gains it reasonably expected from the contract does not necessarily constitute a substantial impairment. In determining the extent of the impairment, we are to consider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past. The Court long ago observed: “One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the State by making a contract about them.” Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter (1908).</p>
<p id="fbd98249-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation, such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem. Furthermore, since <i>Blaisdell</i>, the Court has indicated that the public purpose need not be addressed to an emergency or temporary situation. One legitimate state interest is the elimination of unforeseen windfall profits. The requirement of a legitimate public purpose guarantees that the State is exercising its police power, rather than providing a benefit to special interests.</p>
<p id="fbd9824a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a legitimate public purpose has been identified, the next inquiry is whether the adjustment of “the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties [is based] upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the legislation’s] adoption.” Unless the State itself is a contracting party, “[a]s is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation, . . . courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.”</p>
<p id="fbd9824b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold determination is whether the Kansas Act has impaired substantially ERG’s contractual rights. Significant here is the fact that the parties <span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span>are operating in a heavily regulated industry. State authority to regulate natural gas prices is well established. At the time of the execution of these contracts, Kansas did not regulate natural gas prices specifically, but its supervision of the industry was extensive and intrusive.</p>
<p id="fbd9824c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is in this context that the indefinite escalator clauses at issue here are to be viewed. In drafting each of the contracts, the parties included a statement of intent, which made clear that the escalator clause was designed to guarantee price increases consistent with anticipated increases in the value of ERG’s gas. The very existence of the governmental price escalator clause and the price redetermination clause indicates that the contracts were structured against the background of regulated gas prices. If deregulation had not occurred, the contracts undoubtedly would have called for a much smaller price increase than that provided by the Kansas Act’s adoption of the §109 ceiling.</p>
<p id="fbd9824d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the contracts expressly recognize the existence of extensive regulation by providing that any contractual terms are subject to relevant present and future state and federal law. This latter provision could be interpreted to incorporate all future state price regulation, and thus dispose of the Contract Clause claim. Regardless of whether this interpretation is correct, the provision does suggest that ERG knew its contractual rights were subject to alteration by state price regulation. Price regulation existed and was foreseeable as the type of law that would alter contract obligations. Reading the Contract Clause as ERG does would mean that indefinite price escalator clauses could exempt ERG from any regulatory limitation of prices whatsoever. Such a result cannot be permitted. In short, ERG’s reasonable expectations have not been impaired by the Kansas Act.</p>
<p id="fbd9a95e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent, if any, the Kansas Act impairs ERG’s contractual interests, the Kansas Act rests on, and is prompted by, significant and legitimate state interests. Kansas has exercised its police power to protect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation. The State reasonably could find that higher gas prices have caused and will cause hardship among those who use gas heat but must exist on limited fixed incomes. Nor are the means chosen to implement these purposes deficient, particularly in light of the deference to which the Kansas Legislature’s judgment is entitled.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fbd9a95f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, when a state or local government interferes with existing private contracts, a three-part test is used: (1) Is there a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship? (2) If so, does it serve a significant and legitimate public purpose? (3) If so, is it reasonably related to achieving the goal? The test is very similar to traditional rational basis review.</p>
<p id="fbd9a960-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the first part of the test, whether there is a substantial impairment of the contract, in General Motors v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181 (1992), the Court rejected a challenge to a state law that changed the workers’ compensation program on the ground that it did not interfere with existing contracts. In 1981, the Michigan Supreme Court interpreted a recently adopted Michigan statute to allow employers to reduce workers’ compensation payments to disabled employees who could receive compensation from other employer-funded sources. In 1987, the Michigan legislature overturned this ruling by statute and required that employers make retroactive payments. Employers sued and said that the change in the <span title="625" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-625">p. 625</span>law constituted an impairment of the obligation of contracts. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected this challenge. It concluded that there was “no contractual agreement regarding the specific workers’ compensation terms allegedly at issue.” The Court explained, “The 1987 statute did not change the legal enforceability of the employment contracts here. . . . Moreover, petitioners’ suggestion that we should read every workplace regulation into the private contracted arrangements of employers and employees would expand the definition of contract so far that the constitutional provision would lose its anchoring purpose . . . [and i]nstead, the Clause would protect against all changes in legislation.”</p>
<p id="fbd9a961-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the second and third prongs of the test, state and local laws are upheld, even if they interfere with contractual rights, as long as they meet a rational basis test. Not surprisingly, virtually all laws have been found to meet this deferential scrutiny. For example, in El Paso v. Simmons, 379 U.S. 497 (1965), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that clearly changed the terms of a contract. Under a 1910 contract, Texas sold public lands. The contract provided that if interest was not paid in a timely fashion, the state could terminate the contract and reclaim the land. However, the contract said that an owner could reinstate a claim to the land by paying the delinquent interest owed. In 1941, Texas adopted a law saying that reinstatement had to occur within five years after there was a forfeiture for nonpayment.</p>
<p id="fbd9a962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court upheld the Texas law, even though it obviously limited the rights of landowners to reclaim land that had been forfeited. The Court said that the law had a legitimate purpose in that it was intended “to restore confidence in the stability and integrity of land titles” and to end the “imbroglio over land titles in Texas.” The Court found that the law was reasonably designed to achieve these goals and thus did not violate the Contracts Clause.</p>
<p id="fbd9a963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470 (1987), the Court found that a state law limiting coal mining impaired existing contracts, but nonetheless upheld the law because it served a significant government interest. A state law prohibited coal mining that would cause subsidence damage to property. The coal mine companies frequently had entered into agreements with those owning the surface rights, whereby the companies were allowed to mine, even if it caused subsidence of the land. In other words, the law prevented exactly what the coal miners had bargained to be able to do. Although the Court recognized that the law interfered with contractual rights, it upheld the law because it was a reasonable way to prevent or repair environmental damage caused by coal mining.</p>
<p id="fbd9a964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most recently, in Sveen v. Melin, 138 S. Ct. 1815 (2018), the Court again declined to use the contracts clause to invalidate a state law. Minnesota revised its law and adopted a statute that provides that “the dissolution or annulment of a marriage revokes any revocable . . . beneficiary designation . . . made by an individual to the individual’s former spouse.” Under this statute, if one spouse has made the other the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or similar asset, their divorce automatically revokes that designation so that the insurance proceeds will instead go to the contingent beneficiary or the policyholder’s estate upon his death. The law does this on the theory that the policyholder would want that result. But if he or she does not, the person may rename the ex-spouse as beneficiary.</p>
<p id="fbd9a965-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mark Sveen and Kaye Melin were married and Sveen named Melin as the primary beneficiary of his life insurance policy, while designating his two children <span title="626" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-626">p. 626</span>from a prior marriage, Ashley and Antone Sveen, as the contingent beneficiaries. The Sveen-Melin marriage ended in 2007. The divorce decree made no mention of the insurance policy. And Sveen took no action, then or later, to revise his beneficiary designations. In 2011, he passed away. Melin sued saying that the new Minnesota law violated the contracts clause of Article I, §10.</p>
<p id="fbd9a966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in an 8-1 decision, rejected this argument and upheld the Minnesota law. In an opinion by Justice Kagan, the Court said that the “statute does not substantially impair pre-existing contractual arrangements.” The Court acknowledged that “the law makes a significant change,” but said that it was not a substantial impairment of contract rights: “First, the statute is designed to reflect a policyholder’s intent—and so to support, rather than impair, the contractual scheme. Second, the law is unlikely to disturb any policyholder’s expectations because it does no more than a divorce court could always have done. And third, the statute supplies a mere default rule, which the policyholder can undo in a moment.”</p>
<p id="fbd9a967-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is only one case since 1934 where the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional a state law that interfered with private contracts: Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234 (1978). An Illinois company operated an office in Minnesota and provided a pension plan for its employees. The terms of the plan provided that the company could, at any time, amend the plan or terminate the plan and distribute the assets to the employees. Employees were entitled to collect under the plan if they worked for the company until they reached age 65 and if the plan was in effect at that time. Minnesota adopted a Private Pension Benefits Protection Act that required employers to pay a “pension funding charge” if they terminated a pension plan or closed a Minnesota office. The charge was to ensure that pensions would be available for individuals when they reached retirement age. Allied Structural Steel closed its Minnesota facility and was assessed a $185,000 fee.</p>
<p id="fbd9a968-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court found that the Minnesota law violated the Contracts Clause. Justice Potter Stewart, writing for the Court, began by declaring that the “Contract Clause remains part of the Constitution. It is not a dead letter.” The Court found that the Minnesota statute was a substantial impairment of the obligation of contracts. The Court reasoned that the employer had a contract with its employees that permitted the termination of the contract at any point. The state, by forcing the company to make pension payments, was essentially abrogating this provision.</p>
<p id="fbd9a969-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the law was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored emergency legislation like that in <i>Blaisdell</i>. Justice Stewart stated, “[T]his law can hardly be characterized, like the law at issue in the <i>Blaisdell</i> case, as one enacted to protect a broad society interest rather than a narrow class. This legislation, imposing a sudden, totally unanticipated, and substantial retroactive obligation upon the company to its employees, was not enacted to deal with a situation remotely approaching the broad and desperate economic conditions of the early 1930s. . . . [If] the Contract Clause means anything at all, it means that Minnesota could not constitutionally do what it tried to do to the company in this case.”</p>
<p id="fbd9a96a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because <i>Allied Structural Steel</i> has not been followed by the Supreme Court in the last two decades, it is difficult to know whether it is an anomaly or whether it is a precedent that might someday be used to revitalize the Contracts Clause. Thus far, the Contracts Clause cases since <i>Allied Structural Steel</i> (presented and described above)—such as <i>Energy Reserves Group</i> and <i>Keystone Bituminous <span title="627" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-627">p. 627</span>Coal</i>—have distinguished <i>Allied Structural Steel</i> and have refused to find a violation of the Contracts Clause.</p>

That statute, together with a concurrent and parallel New York statute, repealed a statutory covenant made by the two States in 1962 that had limited the ability of The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to subsidize rail passenger transportation from revenues and reserves.</p>
<p id="fbd9d086-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first examine appellant’s general claim that repeal of the 1962 covenant impaired the obligation of the States’ contract with the bondholders. It long has been established that the Contract Clause limits the power of the States to modify their own contracts as well as to regulate those between private parties. Fletcher v. Peck (1810); Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819). Yet the Contract Clause does not prohibit the States from repealing or amending statutes generally, or from enacting legislation with retroactive effects. Thus, as a preliminary matter, appellant’s claim requires a determination that the repeal has the effect of impairing a contractual obligation.</p>
<p id="fbd9d087-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the obligation was itself created by a statute, the 1962 legislative covenant. It is unnecessary, however, to dwell on the criteria for determining whether state legislation gives rise to a contractual obligation. The trial court found, and appellees do not deny, that the 1962 covenant constituted a contract between the two States and the holders of the Consolidated Bonds issued between 1962 and the 1973 prospective repeal. The intent to make a contract is clear from the statutory language: “The 2 States covenant and agree with each other and with the holders of any affected bonds. . . .” Moreover, as the chronology set forth above reveals, the purpose of the covenant was to invoke the constitutional protection of the Contract Clause as security against repeal. In return for their promise, the States received the benefit they bargained for: public marketability of Port Authority bonds to finance construction of the World <span title="628" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-628">p. 628</span>Trade Center and acquisition of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad. We therefore have no doubt that the 1962 covenant has been properly characterized as a contractual obligation of the two States.</p>
<p id="fbd9d088-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not always unconstitutional, however, for changes in statutory remedies to affect pre-existing contracts. During the early years when the Contract Clause was regarded as an absolute bar to any impairment, this result was reached by treating remedies in a manner distinct from substantive contract obligations. Thus, for example, a State could abolish imprisonment for debt because elimination of this remedy did not impair the underlying obligation. Yet it was also recognized very early that the distinction between remedies and obligations was not absolute. Impairment of a remedy was held to be unconstitutional if it effectively reduced the value of substantive contract rights.</p>
<p id="fbd9d089-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although now largely an outdated formalism, the remedy/obligation distinction may be viewed as approximating the result of a more particularized inquiry into the legitimate expectations of the contracting parties. The parties may rely on the continued existence of adequate statutory remedies for enforcing their agreement, but they are unlikely to expect that state law will remain entirely static. Thus, a reasonable modification of statutes governing contract remedies is much less likely to upset expectations than a law adjusting the express terms of an agreement. In this respect, the repeal of the 1962 covenant is to be seen as a serious disruption of the bondholders’ expectations.</p>
<p id="fbd9d08a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The States must possess broad power to adopt general regulatory measures without being concerned that private contracts will be impaired, or even destroyed, as a result. Otherwise, one would be able to obtain immunity from the state regulation by making private contractual arrangements. Yet private contracts are not subject to unlimited modification under the police power. The Court in <i>Blaisdell</i> recognized that laws intended to regulate existing contractual relationships must serve a legitimate public purpose. A State could not “adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them.” Legislation adjusting the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties must be upon reasonable conditions and of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying its adoption. As is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation, however, courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.</p>
<p id="fbd9d08b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a State impairs the obligation of its own contract, the reserved powers doctrine has a different basis. As with laws impairing the obligations of private contracts, an impairment may be constitutional if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. In applying this standard, however, complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because the State’s self-interest is at stake. A governmental entity can always find a use for extra money, especially when taxes do not have to be raised. If a State could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all.</p>
<p id="fbd9d08c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mass transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection are goals that are important and of legitimate public concern. Appellees contend that these goals are so important that any harm to bondholders from repeal of the 1962 covenant is greatly outweighed by the public benefit. We do not accept this invitation to engage in a utilitarian comparison of public benefit and <span title="629" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-629">p. 629</span>private loss. [A] State cannot refuse to meet its legitimate financial obligations simply because it would prefer to spend the money to promote the public good rather than the private welfare of its creditors. We can only sustain the repeal of the 1962 covenant if that impairment was both reasonable and necessary to serve the admittedly important purposes claimed by the State.</p>
<p id="fbd9d08d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more specific justification offered for the repeal of the 1962 covenant was the States’ plan for encouraging users of private automobiles to shift to public transportation. The States intended to discourage private automobile use by raising bridge and tunnel tolls and to use the extra revenue from those tolls to subsidize improved commuter railroad service. Appellees contend that repeal of the 1962 covenant was necessary to implement this plan because the new mass transit facilities could not possibly be self-supporting and the covenant’s “permitted deficits” level had already been exceeded. We reject this justification because the repeal was neither necessary to achievement of the plan nor reasonable in light of the circumstances.</p>
<p id="fbd9d08e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination of necessity can be considered on two levels. First, it cannot be said that total repeal of the covenant was essential; a less drastic modification would have permitted the contemplated plan without entirely removing the covenant’s limitations on the use of Port Authority revenues and reserves to subsidize commuter railroads. Second, without modifying the covenant at all, the States could have adopted alternative means of achieving their twin goals of discouraging automobile use and improving mass transit. Appellees contend, however, that choosing among these alternatives is a matter for legislative discretion. But a State is not completely free to consider impairing the obligations of its own contracts on a par with other policy alternatives. Similarly, a State is not free to impose a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.</p>
<p id="fbd9f79f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also cannot conclude that repeal of the covenant was reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. [I]n the instant case the need for mass transportation in the New York metropolitan area was not a new development, and the likelihood that publicly owned commuter railroads would produce substantial deficits was well known. As early as 1922, over a half century ago, there were pressures to involve the Port Authority in mass transit. It was with full knowledge of these concerns that the 1962 covenant was adopted. Indeed, the covenant was specifically intended to protect the pledged revenues and reserves against the possibility that such concerns would lead the Port Authority into greater involvement in deficit mass transit.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 12-year period between adoption of the covenant and its repeal, public perception of the importance of mass transit undoubtedly grew because of increased general concern with environmental protection and energy conservation. But these concerns were not unknown in 1962, and the subsequent changes were of degree and not of kind. We cannot say that these changes caused the covenant to have a substantially different impact in 1974 than when it was adopted in 1962. And we cannot conclude that the repeal was reasonable in the light of changed circumstances.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits the retroactive repeal of the 1962 covenant.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-630">p. 630</span>Decisions of this Court for at least a century have construed the Contract Clause largely to be powerless in binding a State to contracts limiting the authority of successor legislatures to enact laws in furtherance of the health, safety, and similar collective interests of the polity. In short, those decisions established the principle that lawful exercises of a State’s police powers stand paramount to private rights held under contract. Today’s decision, in invalidating the New Jersey Legislature’s 1974 repeal of its predecessor’s 1962 covenant, rejects this previous understanding and remolds the Contract Clause into a potent instrument for overseeing important policy determinations of the state legislature. At the same time, by creating a constitutional safe haven for property rights embodied in a contract, the decision substantially distorts modern constitutional jurisprudence governing regulation of private economic interests. I might understand, though I could not accept, this revival of the Contract Clause were it in accordance with some coherent and constructive view of public policy. But elevation of the Clause to the status of regulator of the municipal bond market at the heavy price of frustration of sound legislative policymaking is as demonstrably unwise as it is unnecessary. The justification for today’s decision, therefore, remains a mystery to me, and I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s consideration of [the] actual background is, I believe, most unsatisfactory. The Court never explicitly takes issue with the core of New Jersey’s defense of the repeal: that the State was faced with serious and growing environmental, energy, and transportation problems, and the covenant worked at cross-purposes with efforts at remedying these concerns. Indeed, the Court candidly concedes that the State’s purposes in effectuating the 1974 repeal were “admittedly important.” Instead, the Court’s analysis focuses upon related, but peripheral, matters.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equally unconvincing is the Court’s contention that repeal of the 1962 covenant was unreasonable because the environmental and energy concerns that prompted such action “were not unknown in 1962, and the subsequent changes were of degree and not of kind.” Nowhere are we told why a state policy, no matter how responsive to the general welfare of its citizens, can be reasonable only if it confronts issues that previously were absolutely unforeseen.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today dusts off the Contract Clause and thereby undermines the bipartisan policies of two States that manifestly seek to further the legitimate needs of their citizens. The Court’s analysis, I submit, fundamentally misconceives the nature of the Contract Clause guarantee. One of the fundamental premises of our popular democracy is that each generation of representatives can and will remain responsive to the needs and desires of those whom they represent. Crucial to this end is the assurance that new legislators will not automatically be bound by the policies and undertakings of earlier days. In accordance with this philosophy, the framers of our Constitution conceived of the Contract Clause primarily as protection for economic transactions entered into by purely private parties, rather than obligations involving the State itself. The framers fully recognized that nothing would so jeopardize the legitimacy of a system of government that relies upon the ebbs and flows of politics to “clean out the rascals” than the possibility that those same rascals might perpetuate their policies simply by locking them into binding contracts.</p>
<p id="fbd9f7a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would not want to be read as suggesting that the States should blithely proceed down the path of repudiating their obligations, financial or otherwise. Their credibility in the credit market obviously is highly dependent on exercising their vast lawmaking powers with self-restraint and discipline, and I, for one, <span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span>have little doubt that few, if any, jurisdictions would choose to use their authority “so foolish[ly] as to kill a goose that lays golden eggs for them.” But in the final analysis, there is no reason to doubt that appellant’s financial welfare is being adequately policed by the political processes and the bond marketplace itself. The role to be played by the Constitution is at most a limited one. For this Court should have learned long ago that the Constitution be it through the Contract or Due Process Clause can actively intrude into such economic and policy matters only if my Brethren are prepared to bear enormous institutional and social costs. Because I consider the potential dangers of such judicial interference to be intolerable, I dissent.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fbd9f7a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispute between the majority and the dissent in United States Trust v. New Jersey is over whether the Contracts Clause should apply to government contracts and, if so, the appropriate test to be used. Although the Court did not articulate a level of scrutiny, its use of least restrictive alternative analysis and the word “necessary” seem clearly indicative of heightened scrutiny. Because there has not been another Supreme Court case since <i>United States Trust</i> concerning government interference with government contracts, the precise test remains uncertain. Nonetheless, it is clear that laws impairing the government’s obligations under its own contracts will be subjected to much more careful review than will laws interfering with private contracts.</p>

<p id="fbd9f7ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the federal government and the states have the power of eminent domain; this is the authority to take private property when necessary for government activities. However, the Constitution contains an important limit on this power: The Fifth Amendment states, “[N]or shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” This was the first provision of the Bill of Rights to be applied to the states.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109F3_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109F3_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span></p>
<p id="fbda1ebf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Analysis under the Takings Clause can be divided into four questions. First, is there a “taking”? As described below, there are two basic ways of finding a taking. A possessory taking occurs when the government confiscates or physically occupies property. Alternately, a regulatory taking is when government regulation leaves no reasonable economically viable use of property.</p>
<p id="fbda1ec0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, is it “property”? Obviously, only if the object of the taking is “property” does the Fifth Amendment provision apply. Generally, the Court has relied on other sources of law, usually state law, in deciding whether there is a property interest.</p>
<p id="fbda1ec1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, if there is a taking of property, the next question becomes: Is the taking for “public use”? If the taking is not for public use, the government must give the property back. However, as also is discussed below, the Court has very broadly defined public use so that almost any taking will meet the requirement. <span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-632">p. 632</span>The Court has said that a taking is for public use as long as it is “rationally related to a conceivable public purpose”;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A06_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A06_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> in other words, a taking is for public use as long as it meets the rational basis test.</p>
<p id="fbda1ec3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, assuming that it is a taking for public use, the final question becomes: Is “just compensation” paid? The key is that just compensation is measured in terms of the loss to the owner; the gain to the taker is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="fbda1ec4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Takings Clause is the most important protection of property rights in the Constitution. In part, the Takings Clause is about ensuring that the government does not confiscate the property of some to give it to others. Long ago, in Calder v. Bull, the Court condemned such a practice as violating the natural law principles on which the Constitution was founded.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A14_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A14_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span></p>
<p id="fbda1ec6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part, too, the Takings Clause is about loss spreading. If the government takes away a person’s property to benefit society, then society should pay. The Supreme Court has explained that a principal purpose of the Takings Clause is “to bar the Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A1D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A1D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span></p>
<p id="fbda1ec8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet, as described below, very difficult questions arise in determining when the government incurs this obligation to pay just compensation. Almost any government regulation decreases the value of someone’s property. The Court thus has long noted that “[g]overnment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A26_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A26_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span> No bright-line test ever has been, or likely ever will be, formulated to determine when government actions that decrease the value of property become a taking. Indeed, the Court has admitted that it “has been unable to develop any ‘set formula’ for determining when ‘justice and fairness’ require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A2C_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A2C_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span> Rather, the Court has engaged in “ad hoc, factual inquiries” that turn “upon the particular circumstances in that case.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A32_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A32_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span> The result is a very large body of cases concerning the Takings Clause, but it often is difficult to find coherent principles to make sense of them.</p>

<p id="fbda6cfc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to 1973, Teleprompter routinely obtained authorization for its installations from property owners along the cable’s route, compensating the owners at the standard rate of 5% of the gross revenues that Teleprompter realized from the particular property. To facilitate tenant access to CATV, the State of New York enacted §828 of the Executive Law, effective January 1, 1973. Section 828 provides that a landlord may not “interfere with the installation of cable television facilities upon his property or premises,” and may not demand payment from any tenant for permitting CATV, or demand payment from any CATV company “in excess of any amount which the [State Commission on Cable Television] shall, by regulation, determine to be reasonable.” The landlord may, however, require the CATV company or the tenant to bear the cost of installation and to indemnify for any damage caused by the installation. Pursuant to §828(1)(b), the State Commission has ruled that a one-time $1 payment is the normal fee to which a landlord is entitled.</p>
<p id="fbda6cfd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals determined that §828 serves the legitimate public purpose of “rapid development of and maximum penetration by a means of communication which has important educational and community aspects,” and thus <span title="634" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-634">p. 634</span>is within the State’s police power. We have no reason to question that determination. It is a separate question, however, whether an otherwise valid regulation so frustrates property rights that compensation must be paid.</p>
<p id="fbda6cfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve. Our constitutional history confirms the rule, recent cases do not question it, and the purposes of the Takings Clause compel its retention.</p>
<p id="fbda940f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Court has often upheld substantial regulation of an owner’s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest. At the same time, we have long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause. Our cases further establish that when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred. In such a case, “the character of the government action” not only is an important factor in resolving whether the action works a taking but also is determinative.</p>
<p id="fbda9410-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property, this Court has invariably found a taking. As early as 1872, in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., this Court held that the defendant’s construction, pursuant to state authority, of a dam which permanently flooded plaintiff’s property constituted a taking. A unanimous Court stated, without qualification, that “where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material, or by having any artificial structure placed on it, so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbda9411-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recent cases confirm the distinction between a permanent physical occupation, a physical invasion short of an occupation, and a regulation that merely restricts the use of property. In United States v. Causby (1946), the Court ruled that frequent flights immediately above a landowner’s property constituted a taking, comparing such over flights to the quintessential form of a taking.</p>
<p id="fbda9412-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, when the “character of the governmental action,” is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.</p>
<p id="fbda9413-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, whether a permanent physical occupation has occurred presents relatively few problems of proof. The placement of a fixed structure on land or real property is an obvious fact that will rarely be subject to dispute. Once the fact of occupation is shown, of course, a court should consider the extent of the occupation as one relevant factor in determining the compensation due. For that reason, moreover, there is less need to consider the extent of the occupation in determining whether there is a taking in the first instance.</p>
<p id="fbda9414-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter’s cable installation on appellant’s building constitutes a taking under the traditional test. The installation involved a direct physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon the roof and along the building’s exterior wall.</p>

<p id="fbda9416-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Court’s decisions construing the Takings Clause state anything clearly, it is that “[t]here is no set formula to determine where regulation ends and <span title="635" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-635">p. 635</span>taking begins.” Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead (1962). In a curiously ana-chronistic decision, the Court today acknowledges its historical disavowal of set formulae in almost the same breath as it constructs a rigid per se takings rule: “a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.” To sustain its rule against our recent precedents, the Court erects a strained and untenable distinction between “temporary physical invasions,” whose constitutionality concededly “is subject to a balancing process,” and “permanent physical occupations,” which are “taking[s] without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine.”</p>
<p id="fbda9417-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the Court’s approach “reduces the constitutional issue to a formalistic quibble” over whether property has been “permanently occupied” or “temporarily invaded.” The Court’s application of its formula to the facts of this case vividly illustrates that its approach is potentially dangerous as well as misguided. Despite its concession that “States have broad power to regulate . . . the landlord-tenant relationship . . . without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails,” the Court uses its rule to undercut a carefully considered legislative judgment concerning landlord-tenant relationships.</p>

<p id="fbdabb2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the United States Department of Agriculture’s California Raisin Marketing Order, a percentage of a grower’s crop must be physically set aside in certain years for the account of the Government, free of charge. The Government then sells, allocates, or otherwise disposes of the raisins in ways it determines are best suited to maintaining an orderly market. The question is whether the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars the Government from imposing such a demand on the growers without just compensation.</p>
<p id="fbdabb30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate “marketing orders” to help maintain stable markets for particular agricultural products. The marketing order for raisins requires growers in certain years to give a percentage of their crop to the Government, free of charge. The required allocation is determined by the Raisin Administrative Committee, a Government entity composed largely of growers and others in the raisin business appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. In 2002-2003, this Committee ordered raisin growers to turn over 47 percent of their crop. In 2003-2004, 30 percent.</p>
<p id="fbdabb31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hornes—Marvin Horne, Laura Horne, and their family—are both raisin growers and handlers. They “handled” not only their own raisins but also those produced by other growers, paying those growers in full for all of their <span title="636" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-636">p. 636</span>raisins, not just the free-tonnage portion. In 2002, the Hornes refused to set aside any raisins for the Government, believing they were not legally bound to do so. The Government sent trucks to the Hornes’ facility at eight o’clock one morning to pick up the raisins, but the Hornes refused entry. The Government then assessed against the Hornes a fine equal to the market value of the missing raisins—some $480,000—as well as an additional civil penalty of just over $200,000 for disobeying the order to turn them over.</p>
<p id="fbdabb32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Government sought to collect the fine, the Hornes turned to the courts, arguing that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbdae143-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question presented asks “Whether the government’s ‘categorical duty’ under the Fifth Amendment to pay just compensation when it ‘physically takes possession of an interest in property,’ applies only to real property and not to personal property.” The answer is no.</p>
<p id="fbdae144-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no dispute that the “classic taking [is one] in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use.” Nor is there any dispute that, in the case of real property, such an appropriation is a <i>per se</i> taking that requires just compensation.</p>
<p id="fbdae145-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing in the text or history of the Takings Clause, or our precedents, suggests that the rule is any different when it comes to appropriation of personal property. The Government has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.</p>
<p id="fbdae146-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reserve requirement imposed by the Raisin Committee is a clear physical taking. Actual raisins are transferred from the growers to the Government. Title to the raisins passes to the Raisin Committee. The Committee’s raisins must be physically segregated from free-tonnage raisins. Reserve raisins are sometimes left on the premises of handlers, but they are held “for the account” of the Government. The Committee disposes of what become its raisins as it wishes, to promote the purposes of the raisin marketing order.</p>
<p id="fbdae147-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Raisin growers subject to the reserve requirement thus lose the entire “bundle” of property rights in the appropriated raisins—“the rights to possess, use and dispose of” them—with the exception of the speculative hope that some residual proceeds may be left when the Government is done with the raisins and has deducted the expenses of implementing all aspects of the marketing order. The Government’s “actual taking of possession and control” of the reserve raisins gives rise to a taking as clearly “as if the Government held full title and ownership,” as it essentially does. The Government’s formal demand that the Hornes turn over a percentage of their raisin crop without charge, for the Government’s control and use, is “of such a unique character that it is a taking without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine.”</p>

<p id="fbdb0863-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house. The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface but in express terms reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same and the grantee takes the premises with the risk and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that whatever may have been the Coal Company’s rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921, commonly known there as the Kohler Act.</p>
<p id="fbdb0864-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.</p>
<p id="fbdb0865-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and Due Process Clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.</p>
<p id="fbdb0866-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. But usually in ordinary private affairs the public interest does not warrant much <span title="638" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-638">p. 638</span>of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public.</p>
<p id="fbdb0867-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extent of the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land—a very valuable estate—and what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="fbdb0868-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation.</p>
<p id="fbdb0869-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said this is a question of degree—and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court.</p>
<p id="fbdb2f7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.</p>
<p id="fbdb2f7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brandeis</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbdb2f7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in such a manner or to such an extent “as to cause the . . . subsidence of . . . any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation, or any factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile establishment in which human labor is employed.” Coal in place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the Legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation; and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the <span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-639">p. 639</span>right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>
<p id="fbdb2f7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious—as it may because of further change in local or social conditions—the restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy his property as heretofore.</p>

Neither the judgment of the court nor the statute as interpreted allows compensation for the value of the standing cedars or the decrease in the market value of the realty caused by their destruction whether considered as ornamental trees or otherwise.

The only practicable method of controlling the disease and protecting apple trees from its ravages is the destruction of all red cedar trees, subject to the infection, located within two miles of apple orchards.</p>
<p id="fbdb5697-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The red cedar, aside from its ornamental use, has occasional use and value as lumber. It is indigenous to Virginia, is not cultivated or dealt in commercially on any substantial scale, and its value throughout the state is shown to be small as compared with that of the apple orchards of the state. Apple growing is one of the principal agricultural pursuits in Virginia. The apple is used there and exported in large quantities. Many millions of dollars are invested in the <span title="640" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-640">p. 640</span>orchards, which furnish employment for a large portion of the population, and have induced the development of attendant railroad and cold storage facilities.</p>
<p id="fbdb5698-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the evidence we may accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Appeals that the state was under the necessity of making a choice between the preservation of one class of property and that of the other wherever both existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been none the less a choice if, instead of enacting the present statute, the state, by doing nothing, had permitted serious injury to the apple orchards within its borders to go on unchecked. When forced to such a choice the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another which, in the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public. It will not do to say that the case is merely one of a conflict of two private interests and that the misfortune of apple growers may not be shifted to cedar owners by ordering the destruction of their property; for it is obvious that there may be, and that here there is, a preponderant public concern in the preservation of the one interest over the other. And where the public interest is involved preferment of that interest over the property interest of the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects property.</p>
<p id="fbdb5699-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For where, as here, the choice is unavoidable, we cannot say that its exercise, controlled by considerations of social policy which are not unreasonable, involves any denial of due process.</p>

<p id="fbdb569a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue of when government regulation constitutes a taking remains important and difficult to this day. No formula exists. But the Court has articulated general criteria that should be considered in evaluating whether a regulation is a taking. For example, in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 475 U.S. 211 (1986), the Court said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbdb569b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have eschewed the development of any set formula for identifying a “taking” forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, and have relied instead on ad hoc, factual inquiries into the circumstances of each particular case. To aid in this determination, however, we have identified three factors which have “particular significance”: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbdb569c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These criteria obviously accord courts a tremendous amount of discretion, and it is not surprising that cases concerning regulatory takings are often inconsistent and difficult to reconcile. As the criteria indicate, the Court especially focuses on the economic effect of the government regulations and the extent to which they interfere with the reasonable expectations of the property owner.</p>
<p id="fbdb569d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One important principle that emerges from the cases and that is crucial in judicial consideration of regulatory takings is that government regulation is a taking if it leaves no reasonable economically viable use of property; government regulation is not a taking simply because it decreases the value of a person’s property, as long as it leaves reasonable economically viable uses.</p>
<p id="fbdb569e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comparison of the following two Supreme Court cases illustrates this principle.</p>

<p id="fbdb7db5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is whether a city may, as part of a comprehensive program to preserve historic landmarks and historic districts, place restrictions on the development of individual historic landmarks—in addition to those imposed by applicable zoning ordinances—without effecting a “taking” requiring the payment of “just compensation.” Specifically, we must decide whether the application of New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Law to the parcel of land occupied by Grand Central Terminal has “taken” its owners’ property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

<p id="fbdb7db8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the past 50 years, all 50 States and over 500 municipalities have enacted laws to encourage or require the preservation of buildings and areas with historic or aesthetic importance. These nationwide legislative efforts have been precipitated by two concerns. The first is recognition that, in recent years, large numbers of historic structures, landmarks, and areas have been destroyed without adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the destroyed properties for use in economically productive ways. The second is a widely shared belief that structures with special historic, cultural, or architectural significance enhance the quality of life for all. Not only do these buildings and their workmanship represent the lessons of the past and embody precious features of our heritage, they serve as examples of quality for today. “[H]istoric conservation is but one aspect of the much larger problem, basically an environmental one, of enhancing—or perhaps developing for the first time—the quality of life for people.”</p>

<p id="fbdb7dba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves the application of New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Law to Grand Central Terminal (Terminal). The Terminal, which is owned by the Penn Central Transportation Co. and its affiliates (Penn Central), is one of New York City’s most famous buildings. Opened in 1913, it is regarded not only as providing an ingenious engineering solution to the problems presented by urban railroad stations, but also as a magnificent example of the French beaux-arts style.</p>
<p id="fbdb7dbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Terminal is located in midtown Manhattan. Its south facade faces 42d Street and that street’s intersection with Park Avenue. At street level, the Terminal is bounded on the west by Vanderbilt Avenue, on the east by the Commodore Hotel, and on the north by the Pan-American Building. The Terminal itself is an eight-story structure which Penn Central uses as a railroad station and in which it rents space not needed for railroad purposes to a variety of commercial interests. The Terminal is one of a number of properties owned by appellant Penn Central in this area of midtown Manhattan. The others include the Barclay, Biltmore, Commodore, Roosevelt, and Waldorf-Astoria Hotels, the Pan-American Building and other office buildings along Park Avenue, and the Yale Club.</p>
<p id="fbdb7dbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="642" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-642">p. 642</span>On January 22, 1968, appellant Penn Central, to increase its income, entered into a renewable 50-year lease and sublease agreement with appellant UGP Properties, Inc. (UGP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Union General Properties, Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, UGP was to construct a multistory office building above the Terminal. UGP promised to pay Penn Central $1 million annually during construction and at least $3 million annually thereafter. The rentals would be offset in part by a loss of some $700,000 to $1 million in net rentals presently received from concessionaires displaced by the new building.</p>
<p id="fbdb7dbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants UGP and Penn Central then applied to the Commission for permission to construct an office building atop the Terminal.

<p id="fbdba4cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before considering appellants’ specific contentions, it will be useful to review the factors that have shaped the jurisprudence of the Fifth Amendment injunction “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The question of what constitutes a “taking” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty. While this Court has recognized that the “Fifth Amendment’s guarantee . . . [is] designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole,” this Court, quite simply, has been unable to develop any “set formula” for determining when “justice and fairness” require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons. Indeed, we have frequently observed that whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government’s failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by it depends largely “upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.”</p>
<p id="fbdba4d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In engaging in these essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries, the Court’s decisions have identified several factors that have particular significance. The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations are, of course, relevant considerations. So, too, is the character of the governmental action. A “taking” may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More importantly for the present case, in instances in which a state tribunal reasonably concluded that “the health, safety, morals, or general welfare” would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, this Court has upheld land-use regulations that destroyed or adversely affected recognized real property interests. Zoning laws are, of course, the classic example, see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926) (prohibition of industrial use), which have been viewed as permissible governmental action even when prohibiting the most beneficial use of the property. Zoning laws generally do not affect <span title="643" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-643">p. 643</span>existing uses of real property, but “taking” challenges have also been held to be without merit in a wide variety of situations when the challenged governmental actions prohibited a beneficial use to which individual parcels had previously been devoted and thus caused substantial individualized harm. Miller v. Schoene (1928).</p>
<p id="fbdba4d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contending that the New York City law has “taken” their property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, appellants make a series of arguments, which, while tailored to the facts of this case, essentially urge that any substantial restriction imposed pursuant to a landmark law must be accompanied by just compensation if it is to be constitutional. Before considering these, we emphasize what is not in dispute. Because this Court has recognized, in a number of settings, that States and cities may enact land-use restrictions or controls to enhance the quality of life by preserving the character and desirable aesthetic features of a city, appellants do not contest that New York City’s objective of preserving structures and areas with special historic, architectural, or cultural significance is an entirely permissible governmental goal. They also do not dispute that the restrictions imposed on its parcel are appropriate means of securing the purposes of the New York City law.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he submission that appellants may establish a “taking” simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest that they heretofore had believed was available for development is quite simply untenable. [A]ppellants, focusing on the character and impact of the New York City law, argue that it effects a “taking” because its operation has significantly diminished the value of the Terminal site. Appellants concede that the decisions sustaining other land-use regulations, which, like the New York City law, are reasonably related to the promotion of the general welfare, uniformly reject the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a “taking,” see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926) (75% diminution in value caused by zoning law); Hadacheck v. Sebastian (1915) (87½ % diminution in value).</p>
<p id="fbdba4d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stated baldly, appellants’ position appears to be that the only means of ensuring that selected owners are not singled out to endure financial hardship for no reason is to hold that any restriction imposed on individual landmarks pursuant to the New York City scheme is a “taking” requiring the payment of “just compensation.” Agreement with this argument would, of course, invalidate not just New York City’s law, but all comparable landmark legislation in the Nation. We find no merit in it.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York City law does not interfere in any way with the present uses of the Terminal. Its designation as a landmark not only permits but contemplates that appellants may continue to use the property precisely as it has been used for the past 65 years: as a railroad terminal containing office space and concessions. So the law does not interfere with what must be regarded as Penn Central’s primary expectation concerning the use of the parcel. More importantly, on this record, we must regard the New York City law as permitting Penn Central not only to profit from the Terminal but also to obtain a “reasonable return” on its investment.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, moreover, exaggerate the effect of the law on their ability to make use of the air rights above the Terminal in two respects. First, it simply cannot be maintained, on this record, that appellants have been prohibited from occupying any portion of the airspace above the Terminal. While the Commission’s <span title="644" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-644">p. 644</span>actions in denying applications to construct an office building in excess of 50 stories above the Terminal may indicate that it will refuse to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any comparably sized structure, nothing the Commission has said or done suggests an intention to prohibit any construction above the Terminal. Since appellants have not sought approval for the construction of a smaller structure, we do not know that appellants will be denied any use of any portion of the airspace above the Terminal.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this record, we conclude that the application of New York City’s Landmarks Law has not effected a “taking” of appellants’ property. The restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties.</p>
<p id="fbdba4d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbdbcbe9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the over one million buildings and structures in the city of New York, appellees have singled out 400 for designation as official landmarks. The owner of a building might initially be pleased that his property has been chosen by a distinguished committee of architects, historians, and city planners for such a singular distinction. But he may well discover, as appellant Penn Central Transportation Co. did here, that the landmark designation imposes upon him a substantial cost, with little or no offsetting benefit except for the honor of the designation. The question in this case is whether the cost associated with the city of New York’s desire to preserve a limited number of “landmarks” within its borders must be borne by all of its taxpayers or whether it can instead be imposed entirely on the owners of the individual properties.</p>
<p id="fbdbcbea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over 50 years ago, Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, warned that the courts were “in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon. The Court’s opinion in this case demonstrates that the danger thus foreseen has not abated.</p>
<p id="fbdbcbeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city of New York is in a precarious financial state, and some may believe that the costs of landmark preservation will be more easily borne by corporations such as Penn Central than the overburdened individual taxpayers of New York. But these concerns do not allow us to ignore past precedents construing the Eminent Domain Clause to the end that the desire to improve the public condition is, indeed, achieved by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.</p>

<p id="fbdbcbf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1986, petitioner David H. Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on the Isle of Palms in Charleston County, South Carolina, on which he intended to build single-family homes. In 1988, however, the South Carolina Legislature <span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-645">p. 645</span>enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which had the direct effect of barring petitioner from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his two parcels. A state trial court found that this prohibition rendered Lucas’s parcels “valueless.” This case requires us to decide whether the Act’s dramatic effect on the economic value of Lucas’s lots accomplished a taking of private property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requiring the payment of “just compensation.”</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbdbf304-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late 1970s, Lucas and others began extensive residential development of the Isle of Palms, a barrier island situated eastward of the city of Charleston. Toward the close of the development cycle for one residential subdivision known as “Beachwood East,” Lucas in 1986 purchased the two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. No portion of the lots, which were located approximately 300 feet from the beach, qualified as a “critical area” under the 1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from the Council in advance of any development activity. His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of the immediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect single-family residences. He commissioned architectural drawings for this purpose.</p>
<p id="fbdbf305-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas’s plans to an abrupt end.

<p id="fbdbf306-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, contending that the Beachfront Management Act’s construction bar effected a taking of his property without just compensation. Lucas did not take issue with the validity of the Act as a lawful exercise of South Carolina’s police power, but contended that the Act’s complete extinguishment of his property’s value entitled him to compensation regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives.</p>

<p id="fbdbf308-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to Justice Holmes’s exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a “direct appropriation” of property, or the functional equivalent of a “practical ouster of [the owner’s] possession.” Justice Holmes recognized in <i>Mahon</i>, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government’s power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. If, instead, the uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, “the natural tendency of human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappear[ed].” These considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.”</p>
<p id="fbdbf309-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="646" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-646">p. 646</span>Nevertheless, our decision in <i>Mahon</i> offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going “too far” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding “regulatory takings” jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any “‘set formula’” for determining how far is too far, preferring to “engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.” Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978). We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical “invasion” of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. (1982).</p>
<p id="fbdbf30a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use regulation “does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.”</p>
<p id="fbdbf30b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner’s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply “adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,” in a manner that secures an “average reciprocity of advantage” to everyone concerned. And the functional basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensation—that “Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.</p>
<p id="fbdbf30c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use—typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state—carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm.</p>
<p id="fbdbf30d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CEF_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CEF_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span></p>

<p id="fbdc1a20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner’s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with. In light of our traditional resort to “existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law” to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as “property” under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth (1972), this recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land to a use that is proscribed by those “existing rules or understandings” is surely unexceptional. When, however, a regulation that declares “off-limits” all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on petitioner’s land; they rarely support prohibition of the “essential use” of land. The question, however, is one of state law to be dealt with on remand. We emphasize that to win its case South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature’s declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas.</i> As we have said, a “State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation. . . .” Instead, as it would be required to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a common-law action for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found. Only on this showing can the State fairly claim that, in proscribing all such beneficial uses, the Beachfront Management Act is taking nothing.</p>

<p id="fbdc1a23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse. The State of South Carolina prohibited petitioner Lucas from building a permanent structure on his property from 1988 to 1990. Relying on an unreviewed (and implausible) state trial court finding that this restriction left Lucas’ property valueless, this Court granted review to determine whether compensation must be paid in cases where the State prohibits all economic use of real estate. According to the Court, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our prior cases, and the Court imagines that it will arise “relatively rarely” or only in “extraordinary circumstances.” Almost certainly it did not happen in this case.</p>

I protest not only the Court’s decision, but each step taken to reach it. More fundamentally, I question the Court’s wisdom in issuing sweeping new rules to decide such a narrow case.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court does not reject the South Carolina Supreme Court’s decision simply on the basis of its disbelief and distrust of the legislature’s findings. It also takes the opportunity to create a new scheme for regulations that eliminate all economic value. From now on, there is a categorical rule finding these regulations to be a taking unless the use they prohibit is a background common-law nuisance or property principle.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court repeatedly has recognized the ability of government, in certain circumstances, to regulate property without compensation no matter how adverse the financial effect on the owner may be. More than a century ago, the Court explicitly upheld the right of States to prohibit uses of property injurious to public health, safety, or welfare without paying compensation.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately even the Court cannot embrace the full implications of its per se rule: It eventually agrees that there cannot be a categorical rule for a taking based on economic value that wholly disregards the public need asserted. Instead, the Court decides that it will permit a State to regulate all economic value only if the State prohibits uses that would not be permitted under “background principles of nuisance and property law.” Until today, the Court explicitly had rejected the contention that the government’s power to act without paying compensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is a common-law nuisance.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court makes sweeping and, in my view, misguided and unsupported changes in our takings doctrine. While it limits these changes to the most narrow subset of government regulation—those that eliminate all economic value from land—these changes go far beyond what is necessary to secure petitioner Lucas’ private benefit. One hopes they do not go beyond the narrow confines the Court assigns them to today.</p>

<p id="fbdc1a29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An important area in which the Supreme Court frequently has considered regulatory takings is zoning ordinances. Zoning ordinances limit the way in which a person may use his or her property and therefore frequently have the effect of diminishing the property’s economic value. Generally, though, the Court has refused to find a taking, concluding that the regulation does not eliminate all reasonable economically viable uses of the property.</p>
<p id="fbdc1a2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Village of Euclid v. Amber Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), was one of the first Supreme Court cases to consider a challenge to a zoning ordinance. A tract of vacant land was zoned for industrial uses and had a market value of about $10,000 per acre. The land was rezoned so that it could be used only for residential purposes, reducing its value to about $2,500 an acre. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court rejected a due process challenge to the revised zoning ordinance. The Court emphasized the government’s strong police purpose in the zoning regulation. The Court said, “[T]he segregation of residential, business, and industrial buildings will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>for the character and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase the safety and security of home life; greatly tend to prevent street accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential sections; decrease noise and other conditions which produce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more favorable environment in which to rear children.”</p>
<p id="fbdc413b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent cases generally have followed this reasoning and have rejected takings challenges to zoning ordinances. For example, in Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962), a city’s zoning ordinance prevented further excavation of a stone and gravel quarry that had been in operation for over 30 years. The Court rejected the takings claim and noted that “[i]t is an oft-repeated truism that every regulation necessarily speaks as a prohibition. If this ordinance is otherwise a valid exercise of the town’s police powers, the fact that it deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not render it unconstitutional.” The Court said that the zoning ordinance was not a taking because “there is no evidence . . . which even remotely suggests that prohibition of further mining will reduce the value of the lot in question.”</p>
<p id="fbdc413c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980), the Supreme Court rejected a Takings Clause challenge to a zoning ordinance that required that property be used for single-family homes rather than multiple family dwellings. Whereas previously the owners might have constructed apartment or condominium buildings, the city of Tiburon adopted a zoning ordinance limiting construction to single-family homes. The effect of the ordinance was to substantially reduce the value of the property. But the Supreme Court concluded that there was not a taking because the owner still had reasonable economically viable use of the property and because of the government’s important interest in “assuring careful and orderly development of residential property.”</p>
<p id="fbdc413d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has followed this reasoning in other cases where the government’s regulation limits development or use of property. In Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470 (1987), the Court refused to find a taking when a Pennsylvania law prevented mining that could cause subsidence of buildings, and a Pennsylvania agency required that 50 percent of the coal be kept in the land underneath structures. The law and the agency’s interpretation of it had the effect of preventing some mining, even in instances where the coal company had purchased surface rights. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court found that there was not a taking. The Court quoted <i>Agins</i> as establishing that “land use regulation can effect a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests . . . or denies an owner economically viable use of land.”</p>
<p id="fbdc413e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Keystone</i> Court concluded that there was not a taking because the law served legitimate state interests and because it allowed economically viable development of the property. The Court explained that the legislature’s goal was to protect public safety by preventing subsidence of land. The Court also observed that there was not a taking because the law did not eliminate all economically viable use of the property. The Court said, “When the coal that must remain beneath the ground is viewed in the context of any reasonable unit of petitioners’ coal mining operations and financial-backed expectations, it is plain that petitioners have not come close to satisfying their burden of proving that they have been denied the economically viable use of that property.”</p>
<p id="fbdc413f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of these cases indicate that it is very difficult to persuade the Supreme Court that restrictions on the use of property, through zoning or other laws, <span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>constitute a taking. The Court only is willing to find a taking if the law prevents virtually all economically viable uses of the property, as was the situation in <i>Lucas</i>.</p>
<p id="fbdc4140-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Murr v. Wisconsin, 137 S. Ct. 1933 (2017), the issue was how to determine what is the property in deciding if there is a regulatory taking. A family owned two pieces of contiguous property in Wisconsin, but in different trusts. Zoning law prevented the development of one piece of property, but not the other. If they were considered distinct properties, then there would be a regulatory taking for the one where no development was allowed. But if it was all one piece of property, then it was not a regulatory taking because reasonable economically viable use was possible for the whole property.</p>
<p id="fbdc4141-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a 5-3 decision, the Court ruled in favor of the government and found that it should be regarded as one piece of property. Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, said that a multi-factor test should be applied in determining the nature of the property for purposes of the takings clause. The Court wrote: “[N]o single consideration can supply the exclusive test for determining the denominator. Instead, courts must consider a number of factors. These include the treatment of the land under state and local law; the physical characteristics of the land; and the prospective value of the regulated land. The endeavor should determine whether reasonable expectations about property ownership would lead a landowner to anticipate that his holdings would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate tracts. The inquiry is objective, and the reasonable expectations at issue derive from background customs and the whole of our legal tradition.”</p>
<p id="fbdc4142-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, and argued that the focus should be solely on how state law defines the property. He wrote: “State law defines the boundaries of distinct parcels of land, and those boundaries should determine the ‘private property’ at issue in regulatory takings cases.”</p>
<p id="fbdc4143-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The above cases concerned the issue of when government prohibitions or restrictions on the use of property constitute a taking. By contrast, what if the government allows the development of property, but subjects it to specific conditions that the developer must meet?

The program required all Oregon cities and counties to adopt new comprehensive land use plans that were consistent with the statewide planning goals. The plans are implemented by land use regulations which are part of an integrated hierarchy of legally binding goals, plans, and regulations. Pursuant to the State’s requirements, the city of Tigard, a community of some 30,000 residents on the southwest edge of Portland, developed a comprehensive plan and codified it in its Community Development Code (CDC). The CDC requires property owners in the area zoned Central Business District to comply with a 15% open space and landscaping requirement, which limits total site coverage, including all structures and paved parking, to 85% of the parcel. After the completion of a transportation study that identified congestion in the Central Business District as a particular problem, the city adopted a plan for a pedestrian/bicycle pathway intended to encourage alternatives to automobile transportation for short trips. The CDC requires that new development facilitate this plan by dedicating land for pedestrian pathways where provided for in the pedestrian/bicycle pathway plan. The city also adopted a Master Drainage Plan (Drainage Plan). The Drainage Plan noted that flooding occurred in several areas along Fanno Creek, including areas near petitioner’s property.</p>

United States (1960). Without question, had the city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred. Such public access would deprive petitioner of the right to exclude others, “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” Kaiser Aetna v.

The public easement was designed to connect two public beaches that were separated by the Nollans’ property. The Coastal Commission had asserted that the public easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishing the “blockage of the view of the ocean” caused by construction of the larger house.</p>
<p id="fbdc8f7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agreed that the Coastal Commission’s concern with protecting visual access to the ocean constituted a legitimate public interest. We also agreed that the permit condition would have been constitutional “even if it consisted of the requirement that the Nollans provide a viewing spot on their property for passersby with whose sighting of the ocean their new house would interfere.” We resolved, however, that the Coastal Commission’s regulatory authority was set completely adrift from its constitutional moorings when it claimed that a nexus existed between visual access to the ocean and a permit condition requiring lateral public access along the Nollans’ beachfront lot. How enhancing the public’s ability to “traverse to and along the shorefront” served the same governmental purpose of “visual access to the ocean” from the roadway was beyond our ability to countenance. The absence of a nexus left the Coastal Commission in the position of simply trying to obtain an easement through gimmickry, which converted a valid regulation of land use into “‘an out-and-out plan of extortion.’”</p>
<p id="fbdc8f7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No such gimmicks are associated with the permit conditions imposed by the city in this case. Undoubtedly, the prevention of flooding along Fanno Creek and the reduction of traffic congestion in the Central Business District qualify as the type of legitimate public purposes we have upheld. It seems equally obvious that a nexus exists between preventing flooding along Fanno Creek and limiting development within the creek’s 100-year floodplain. Petitioner proposes to double the size of her retail store and to pave her now-gravel parking lot, thereby expanding the impervious surface on the property and increasing the amount of storm water runoff into Fanno Creek.</p>
<p id="fbdc8f7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same may be said for the city’s attempt to reduce traffic congestion by providing for alternative means of transportation. In theory, a pedestrian/bicycle pathway provides a useful alternative means of transportation for workers and shoppers.</p>

<p id="fbdc8f81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second part of our analysis requires us to determine whether the degree of the exactions demanded by the city’s permit conditions bears the required relationship to the projected impact of petitioner’s proposed development.</p>
<p id="fbdc8f82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some States, very generalized statements as to the necessary connection between the required dedication and the proposed development seem to suffice. We think this standard is too lax to adequately protect petitioner’s right to just compensation if her property is taken for a public purpose.</p>
<p id="fbdc8f83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other state courts require a very exacting correspondence, described as the “specifi[c] and uniquely attributable” test. Under this standard, if the local government cannot demonstrate that its exaction is directly proportional to the <span title="654" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-654">p. 654</span>specifically created need, the exaction becomes “a veiled exercise of the power of eminent domain and a confiscation of private property behind the defense of police regulations.” We do not think the Federal Constitution requires such exacting scrutiny, given the nature of the interests involved.</p>
<p id="fbdc8f84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of state courts have taken an intermediate position, requiring the municipality to show a “reasonable relationship” between the required dedication and the impact of the proposed development. Despite any semantical differences, general agreement exists among the courts “that the dedication should have some reasonable relationship to the needs created by the [development].”</p>
<p id="fbdc8f85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the “reasonable relationship” test adopted by a majority of the state courts is closer to the federal constitutional norm than either of those previously discussed. But we do not adopt it as such, partly because the term “reasonable relationship” seems confusingly similar to the term “rational basis” which describes the minimal level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We think a term such as “rough proportionality” best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement of the Fifth Amendment. No precise mathematical calculation is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.</p>
<p id="fbdcb696-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cities have long engaged in the commendable task of land use planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization, particularly in metropolitan areas such as Portland. The city’s goals of reducing flooding hazards and traffic congestion, and providing for public greenways, are laudable, but there are outer limits to how this may be done. “A strong public desire to improve the public condition [will not] warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.” [The Court remanded the case for the application of the standard that it announced.]</p>

<p id="fbdcb698-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court is correct in concluding that the city may not attach arbitrary conditions to a building permit or to a variance even when it can rightfully deny the application outright. Yet the Court’s description of the doctrinal underpinnings of its decision, the phrasing of its fledgling test of “rough proportionality,” and the application of that test to this case run contrary to the traditional treatment of these cases and break considerable and unpropitious new ground.</p>
<p id="fbdcb699-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exactions associated with the development of a retail business are a species of business regulation that heretofore warranted a strong presumption of constitutional validity. The city of Tigard has demonstrated that its plan is rational and impartial and that the conditions at issue are “conducive to fulfillment of authorized planning objectives.” Dolan, on the other hand, has offered no evidence that her burden of compliance has any impact at all on the value or profitability of her planned development. Following the teaching of the cases on which it purports to rely, the Court should not isolate the burden associated with the loss of the power to exclude from an evaluation the benefit to be derived from the permit to enlarge the store and the parking lot.</p>
<p id="fbdcb69a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s assurances that its “rough proportionality” test leaves ample room for cities to pursue the “commendable task of land use planning,”—even twice avowing that “[n]o precise mathematical calculation is required,”—are <span title="655" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-655">p. 655</span>wanting given the result that test compels here. Under the Court’s approach, a city must not only “quantify its findings,” and make “individualized determination[s]” with respect to the nature and the extent of the relationship between the conditions and the impact, but also demonstrate “proportionality.” The correct inquiry should instead concentrate on whether the required nexus is present and venture beyond considerations of a condition’s nature or germaneness only if the developer establishes that a concededly germane condition is so grossly disproportionate to the proposed development’s adverse effects that it manifests motives other than land use regulation on the part of the city.</p>
<p id="fbdcb69b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has made a serious error by abandoning the traditional presumption of constitutionality and imposing a novel burden of proof on a city implementing an admittedly valid comprehensive land use plan. Even more consequential than its incorrect disposition of this case, however, is the Court’s resurrection of a species of substantive due process analysis that it firmly rejected decades ago.</p>
<p id="fbdcb69c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our changing world one thing is certain: uncertainty will characterize predictions about the impact of new urban developments on the risks of floods, earthquakes, traffic congestion, or environmental harms. When there is doubt concerning the magnitude of those impacts, the public interest in averting them must outweigh the private interest of the commercial entrepreneur. If the government can demonstrate that the conditions it has imposed in a land use permit are rational, impartial and conducive to fulfilling the aims of a valid land use plan, a strong presumption of validity should attach to those conditions. The burden of demonstrating that those conditions have unreasonably impaired the economic value of the proposed improvement belongs squarely on the shoulders of the party challenging the state action’s constitutionality. That allocation of burdens has served us well in the past. The Court has stumbled badly today by reversing it.</p>

<p id="fbdcb69d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s most recent case considering when conditions on development constitute a taking involved a situation where, unlike in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, the permit for development was denied. In other words, in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, the property owner went ahead with the development and then argued that the conditions were a taking, while in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, 570 U.S. 595 (2013), the property owner chose not to get a permit for development but nonetheless to challenge the conditions as a taking.</p>
<p id="fbdcb69e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Coy Koontz wanted to develop some of his property on wetlands in Florida. He was told by the St. Johns River Water Management District that he could do this only if he (1) reduced the size of his development and deeded to the District a conservation easement on the resulting larger remainder of his property or (2) hired contractors to make improvements to District-owned wetlands several miles away. Rather than do either of these, he brought a lawsuit arguing that these conditions constituted a taking.</p>
<p id="fbdcb69f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in a 5-4 decision with Justice Alito writing for the majority, ruled in favor of Koontz. There were two parts to the Court’s holding. First, the Court held that “[t]he principles that undergird our decisions in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> do not change depending on whether the government <i>approves</i> a permit on the <span title="656" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-656">p. 656</span>condition that the applicant turn over property or <i>denies</i> a permit because the applicant refuses to do so.”</p>
<p id="fbdcddb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court said that it was a taking even though the government gave Koontz the option of spending money rather than providing an easement on his property. The Court said that “[s]uch so-called ‘in lieu of’ fees are utterly commonplace and they are functionally equivalent to other types of land use exactions. For that reason and those that follow, we reject respondent’s argument and hold that so-called ‘monetary exactions’ must satisfy the nexus and rough proportionality requirements of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>.”</p>
<p id="fbdcddb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Kagan wrote for the four dissenters and expressed concern that there will not be a way to distinguish between impermissible land use exactions and property taxes. She expressed concern that the Court’s holding “threatens to subject a vast array of land-use regulations, applied daily in States and localities throughout the country, to heightened constitutional scrutiny.” She explained: “By applying <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> to permit conditions requiring monetary payments—with no express limitation except as to taxes—the majority extends the Takings Clause, with its notoriously ‘difficult’ and ‘perplexing’ standards, into the very heart of local land-use regulation and service delivery. Cities and towns across the nation impose many kinds of permitting fees every day. Some enable a government to mitigate a new development’s impact on the community, like increased traffic or pollution—or destruction of wetlands. Others cover the direct costs of providing services like sewage or water to the development. Still others are meant to limit the number of landowners who engage in a certain activity, as fees for liquor licenses do. All now must meet <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>’s nexus and proportionality tests. . . . And the flexibility of state and local governments to take the most routine actions to enhance their communities will diminish accordingly.”</p>
<p id="fbdcddb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In subsequent years, the Supreme Court has considered two additional questions concerning regulatory takings. First, can a property owner bring a takings challenge to regulations that already were in place when the property was acquired? Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, below, addresses this question.

<p id="fbdcddb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Anthony Palazzolo owns a waterfront parcel of land in the town of Westerly, Rhode Island. Almost all of the property is designated as coastal wetlands under Rhode Island law. After petitioner’s development proposals were rejected by respondent Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (Council), he sued in state court, asserting the Council’s application of its wetlands regulations took the property without compensation in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, binding upon the State through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner sought review in this Court, contending the Supreme Court of Rhode Island erred in rejecting his takings claim.</p>

<p id="fbdcddbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The town of Westerly is on an edge of the Rhode Island coastline. In 1959 petitioner, a lifelong Westerly resident, decided to invest in three undeveloped, adjoining parcels. To purchase and hold the property, petitioner and associates formed Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI). After SGI purchased the property petitioner bought out his associates and became the sole shareholder. In the first decade of SGI’s ownership of the property the corporation submitted a plat to the town subdividing the property into 80 lots; and it engaged in various transactions that left it with 74 lots, which together encompassed about 20 acres. During the same period SGI also made initial attempts to develop the property and submitted intermittent applications to state agencies to fill substantial portions of the parcel. Most of the property was then, as it is now, salt marsh subject to tidal flooding. The wet ground and permeable soil would require considerable fill—as much as six feet in some places—before significant structures could be built. SGI’s proposal, submitted in 1962 to the Rhode Island Division of Harbors and Rivers (DHR), sought to dredge from Winnapaug Pond and fill the entire property. The application was denied for lack of essential information.</p>
<p id="fbdcddbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second, similar proposal followed a year later. A third application, submitted in 1966 while the second application was pending, proposed more limited filling of the land for use as a private beach club. These latter two applications were referred to the Rhode Island Department of Natural Resources, which indicated initial assent. The agency later withdrew approval, however, citing adverse environmental impacts. SGI did not contest the ruling.</p>
<p id="fbdcddbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No further attempts to develop the property were made for over a decade. Two intervening events, however, become important to the issues presented. First, in 1971, Rhode Island enacted legislation creating the Council, an agency charged with the duty of protecting the State’s coastal properties. Regulations promulgated by the Council designated salt marshes like those on SGI’s property as protected “coastal wetlands.” Second, in 1978 SGI’s corporate charter was revoked for failure to pay corporate income taxes; and title to the property passed, by operation of state law, to petitioner as the corporation’s sole shareholder.</p>
<p id="fbdd04ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1983 petitioner, now the owner, renewed the efforts to develop the property. An application to the Council, resembling the 1962 submission, requested permission to construct a wooden bulkhead along the shore of Winnapaug Pond and to fill the entire marsh land area. The Council rejected the application, noting it was “vague and inadequate for a project of this size and nature.” The agency also found that “the proposed alteration . . . will conflict with the Coastal Resources Management Plan presently in effect.” Petitioner did not appeal the agency’s determination.</p>
<p id="fbdd04cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner went back to the drawing board, this time hiring counsel and preparing a more specific and limited proposal for use of the property. The new application, submitted to the Council in 1985, echoed the 1966 request to build a private beach club. The details do not tend to inspire the reader with an idyllic coastal image, for the proposal was to fill 11 acres of the property with gravel to accommodate “50 cars with boat trailers, a dumpster, port-a-johns, picnic tables, barbecue pits of concrete, and other trash receptacles.”</p>
<p id="fbdd04d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The application fared no better with the Council than previous ones. In a short opinion the Council said the beach club proposal conflicted with the <span title="658" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-658">p. 658</span>regulatory standard for a special exception. To secure a special exception the proposed activity must serve “a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or private interests.” This time petitioner appealed the decision to the Rhode Island courts, challenging the Council’s conclusion as contrary to principles of state administrative law. The Council’s decision was affirmed.</p>
<p id="fbdd04d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner filed an inverse condemnation action in Rhode Island Superior Court, asserting that the State’s wetlands regulations, as applied by the Council to his parcel, had taken the property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The suit alleged the Council’s action deprived him of “all economically beneficial use” of his property, resulting in a total taking requiring compensation under Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council (1992). He sought damages in the amount of $3,150,000, a figure derived from an appraiser’s estimate as to the value of a 74-lot residential subdivision. After a bench trial, a justice of the Superior Court ruled against petitioner, accepting some of the State’s theories. The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed. Like the Superior Court, the State Supreme Court recited multiple grounds for rejecting petitioner’s suit. The court held, first, that petitioner’s takings claim was not ripe; second, that petitioner had no right to challenge regulations predating 1978, when he succeeded to legal ownership of the property from SGI; and third, that the claim of deprivation of all economically beneficial use was contradicted by undisputed evidence that he had $200,000 in development value remaining on an upland parcel of the property.</p>
<p id="fbdd04d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree with the Supreme Court of Rhode Island as to the first two of these conclusions; and, we hold, the court was correct to conclude that the owner is not deprived of all economic use of his property because the value of upland portions is substantial.

<p id="fbdd04d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. The clearest sort of taking occurs when the government encroaches upon or occupies private land for its own proposed use. Our cases establish that even a minimal “permanent physical occupation of real property” requires compensation under the Clause. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. (1982). In Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon (1922), the Court recognized that there will be instances when government actions do not encroach upon or occupy the property yet still affect and limit its use to such an extent that a taking occurs. In Justice Holmes’ well-known, if less than self-defining, formulation, “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if a regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.”</p>
<p id="fbdd04d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since <i>Mahon</i>, we have given some, but not too specific, guidance to courts confronted with deciding whether a particular government action goes too far and effects a regulatory taking. First, we have observed, with certain qualifications, that a regulation which “denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land” will require compensation under the Takings Clause. Where a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically <span title="659" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-659">p. 659</span>beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation’s economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from “forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.”</p>
<p id="fbdd04d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Council promulgated its wetlands regulations, the disputed parcel was owned not by petitioner but by the corporation of which he was sole shareholder. When title was transferred to petitioner by operation of law, the wetlands regulations were in force. The state court held the postregulation acquisition of title was fatal to the claim for deprivation of all economic use and to the <i>Penn Central</i> claim. [The state court’s] holdings together amount to a single, sweeping, rule: A purchaser or a successive title holder like petitioner is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction and is barred from claiming that it effects a taking.</p>
<p id="fbdd04d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The theory underlying the argument that postenactment purchasers cannot challenge a regulation under the Takings Clause seems to run on these lines: Property rights are created by the State. So, the argument goes, by prospective legislation the State can shape and define property rights and reasonable investment-backed expectations, and subsequent owners cannot claim any injury from lost value. After all, they purchased or took title with notice of the limitation.</p>
<p id="fbdd04d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State may not put so potent a Hobbesian stick into the Lockean bundle. The right to improve property, of course, is subject to the reasonable exercise of state authority, including the enforcement of valid zoning and land-use restrictions. The Takings Clause, however, in certain circumstances allows a landowner to assert that a particular exercise of the State’s regulatory power is so unreasonable or onerous as to compel compensation. Just as a prospective enactment, such as a new zoning ordinance, can limit the value of land without effecting a taking because it can be understood as reasonable by all concerned, other enactments are unreasonable and do not become less so through passage of time or title. Were we to accept the State’s rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.</p>
<p id="fbdd04d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does the justification of notice take into account the effect on owners at the time of enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to challenge a new regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his or her claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take years), under the proposed rule the right to compensation may not by asserted by an heir or successor, and so may not be asserted at all. The State’s rule would work a critical alteration to the nature of property, as the newly regulated landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the interest which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State may not by this means secure a windfall for itself. The proposed rule is, furthermore, capricious in effect. The young owner contrasted with the older owner, the owner with the resources to hold contrasted with the owner with the need to sell, would be in different positions. The Takings Clause <span title="660" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-660">p. 660</span>is not so quixotic. A blanket rule that purchasers with notice have no compensation right when a claim becomes ripe is too blunt an instrument to accord with the duty to compensate for what is taken.</p>
<p id="fbdd04da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have no occasion to consider the precise circumstances when a legislative enactment can be deemed a background principle of state law or whether those circumstances are present here. It suffices to say that a regulation that otherwise would be unconstitutional absent compensation is not transformed into a background principle of the State’s law by mere virtue of the passage of title.</p>

It held that all economically beneficial use was not deprived because the uplands portion of the property can still be improved. On this point, we agree with the court’s decision. Petitioner accepts the Council’s contention and the state trial court’s finding that his parcel retains $200,000 in development value under the State’s wetlands regulations. He asserts, nonetheless, that he has suffered a total taking and contends the Council cannot sidestep the holding in <i>Lucas</i> “by the simple expedient of leaving a landowner a few crumbs of value.”</p>

A taking is a discrete event, a governmental acquisition of private property for which the state is required to provide just compensation. Like other transfers of property, it occurs at a particular time, that time being the moment when the relevant property interest is alienated from its owner.</p>
<p id="fbdd2bf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Precise specification of the moment a taking occurred and of the nature of the property interest taken is necessary in order to determine an appropriately compensatory remedy. For example, the amount of the award is measured by the value of the property at the time of taking, not the value at some later date. Similarly, interest on the award runs from that date. Most importantly for our purposes today, it is the person who owned the property at the time of the taking that is entitled to the recovery.</p>

<p id="fbdd2bf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the difficulty of this case stems from genuine confusion as to when the taking Palazzolo alleges actually occurred. If it is the regulations themselves of which petitioner complains, and if they did, in fact, diminish the value of his property, they did so when they were adopted. To the extent that the adoption of the regulations constitute the challenged taking, petitioner is simply the wrong party to be bringing this action. If the regulations imposed a compensable injury on anyone, it was on the owner of the property at the moment the regulations were adopted. Given the trial court’s finding that petitioner did not own the property at that time, in my judgment it is pellucidly clear that he has no standing to claim that the promulgation of the regulations constituted a taking of any part of the property that he subsequently acquired. His lack of standing does not depend, as the Court seems to assume, on whether or not petitioner “is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction.” If those early regulations changed the character of the owner’s title to the property, thereby diminishing its value, petitioner acquired only the net value that remained after that diminishment occurred.</p>
<p id="fbdd2bf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, if, as respondent contends, even the prior owner never had any right to fill wetlands, there never was a basis for the alleged takings claim in the first place. But accepting petitioner’s theory of the case, he has no standing to complain that preacquisition events may have reduced the value of the property that he acquired. If the regulations are invalid, either because improper procedures were followed when they were adopted, or because they have somehow gone “too far,” petitioner may seek to enjoin their enforcement, but he has no right to recover compensation for the value of property taken from someone else. A new owner may maintain an ejectment action against a trespasser who has lodged himself in the owner’s orchard but surely could not recover damages for fruit a trespasser spirited from the orchard before he acquired the property.</p>

<p id="fbdd530c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is whether a moratorium on development imposed during the process of devising a comprehensive land-use plan constitutes a per se taking of property requiring compensation under the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution. This case actually involves two moratoria ordered by respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to maintain the status quo while studying the impact of development on Lake Tahoe and designing a strategy for environmentally sound growth. The first, Ordinance 81-5, was effective from August 24, 1981, until August 26, 1983, whereas the second more restrictive Resolution 83-21 was in effect from August 27, 1983, until April 25, 1984. As a result of these two directives, virtually all development on a substantial portion <span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-662">p. 662</span>of the property subject to TRPA’s jurisdiction was prohibited for a period of 32 months. Although the question we decide relates only to that 32-month period, a brief description of the events leading up to the moratoria and a comment on the two permanent plans that TRPA adopted thereafter will clarify the narrow scope of our holding.</p>

<p id="fbdd530e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relevant facts are undisputed. All agree that Lake Tahoe is “uniquely beautiful,” that President Clinton was right to call it a “‘national treasure that must be protected and preserved,’” and that Mark Twain aptly described the clarity of its waters as “‘not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so.’” Lake Tahoe’s exceptional clarity is attributed to the absence of algae that obscures the waters of most other lakes. Historically, the lack of nitrogen and phosphorous, which nourish the growth of algae, has ensured the transparency of its waters. Unfortunately, the lake’s pristine state has deteriorated rapidly over the past 40 years; increased land development in the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin) has threatened the “‘noble sheet of blue water’” beloved by Twain and countless others. As the District Court found, “[d]ramatic decreases in clarity first began to be noted in the 1950’s/early 1960’s, shortly after development at the lake began in earnest.” The lake’s unsurpassed beauty, it seems, is the wellspring of its undoing.</p>
<p id="fbdd530f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upsurge of development in the area has caused “increased nutrient loading of the lake largely because of the increase in impervious coverage of land in the Basin resulting from that development.” Given this trend, the District Court predicted that “unless the process is stopped, the lake will lose its clarity and its trademark blue color, becoming green and opaque for eternity.”</p>
<p id="fbdd5310-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those areas in the Basin that have steeper slopes produce more runoff; therefore, they are usually considered “high hazard” lands. Moreover, certain areas near streams or wetlands known as “Stream Environment Zones” (SEZs) are especially vulnerable to the impact of development because, in their natural state, they act as filters for much of the debris that runoff carries. Because “[t]he most obvious response to this problem . . . is to restrict development around the lake—especially in SEZ lands, as well as in areas already naturally prone to runoff,” conservation efforts have focused on controlling growth in these high hazard areas.</p>
<p id="fbdd5311-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In combination, Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-21 effectively prohibited all construction on sensitive lands in California and on all SEZ lands in the entire Basin for 32 months, and on sensitive lands in Nevada (other than SEZ lands) for eight months. It is these two moratoria that are at issue in this case.</p>

Those individuals purchased their properties prior to the effective date of the 1980 Compact, primarily for the purpose of constructing “at a time of their choosing” a single-family home “to serve as a permanent, retirement or vacation residence.” When they made those purchases, they did so with the understanding that such construction was authorized provided that “they complied with all reasonable requirements for building.”</p>

<p id="fbdd7a25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners make only a facial attack on Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-21. They contend that the mere enactment of a temporary regulation that, while in effect, denies a property owner all viable economic use of her property gives rise to an unqualified constitutional obligation to compensate her for the value of its use during that period. Hence, they “face an uphill battle,” Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis (1987), that is made especially steep by their desire for a categorical rule requiring compensation whenever the government imposes such a moratorium on development. Under their proposed rule, there is no need to evaluate the landowners’ investment-backed expectations, the actual impact of the regulation on any individual, the importance of the public interest served by the regulation, or the reasons for imposing the temporary restriction. For petitioners, it is enough that a regulation imposes a temporary deprivation—no mater how brief—of all economically viable use to trigger a per se rule that a taking has occurred.</p>
<p id="fbdd7a26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view the answer to the abstract question whether a temporary moratorium effects a taking is neither “yes, always” nor “no, never”; the answer depends upon the particular circumstances of the case. Resisting “[t]he temptation to adopt what amount to per se rules in either direction,” we conclude that the circumstances in this case are best analyzed within the <i>Penn Central</i> framework.</p>

<p id="fbdd7a28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text of the Fifth Amendment itself provides a basis for drawing a distinction between physical takings and regulatory takings. Its plain language requires the payment of compensation whenever the government acquires private property for a public purpose, whether the acquisition is the result of a condemnation proceeding or a physical appropriation. But the Constitution contains no comparable reference to regulations that prohibit a property owner from making certain uses of her private property. Our jurisprudence involving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the Republic and, for the most part, involves the straightforward application of per se rules. Our regulatory takings jurisprudence, in contrast, is of more recent vintage and is characterized by “essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,” designed to allow “careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.”</p>
<p id="fbdd7a29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner, United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (1951), regardless of whether the interest <span title="664" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-664">p. 664</span>that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof. Thus, compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the government occupies the property for its own purposes, even though that use is temporary. Similarly, when the government appropriates part of a rooftop in order to provide cable TV access for apartment tenants, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. (1982); or when its planes use private airspace to approach a government airport, United States v. Causby (1946), it is required to pay for that share no matter how small. But a government regulation that merely prohibits landlords from evicting tenants unwilling to pay a higher rent, Block v. Hirsh (1921); that bans certain private uses of a portion of an owner’s property, Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., (1926); Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis (1987); or that forbids the private use of certain airspace, Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City (1978), does not constitute a categorical taking. “The first category of cases requires courts to apply a clear rule; the second necessarily entails complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government actions.”</p>
<p id="fbdd7a2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“This case does not present the ‘classi[c] taking’ in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use”; instead the interference with property rights “arises from some public program adjusting the benefits. . . .” Perhaps recognizing this fundamental distinction, petitioners wisely do not place all their emphasis on analogies to physical takings cases. Instead, they rely principally on our decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council (1992)—a regulatory takings case that, nevertheless, applied a categorical rule—to argue that the <i>Penn Central</i> framework is inapplicable here.</p>
<p id="fbdd7a2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have “generally eschewed” any set formula for determining how far is too far, choosing instead to engage in “‘essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.’” Indeed, we still resist the temptation to adopt per se rules in our cases involving partial regulatory takings, preferring to examine “a number of factors” rather than a simple “mathematically precise” formula. Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court in <i>Penn Central</i> did, however, make it clear that even though multiple factors are relevant in the analysis of regulatory takings claims, in such cases we must focus on “the parcel as a whole.”</p>
<p id="fbdd7a2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The categorical rule that we applied in <i>Lucas</i> states that compensation is required when a regulation deprives an owner of “all economically beneficial uses” of his land. Under that rule, a statute that “wholly eliminated the value” of Lucas’ fee simple title clearly qualified as a taking. But our holding was limited to “the extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted.” The emphasis on the word “no” in the text of the opinion was, in effect, reiterated in a footnote explaining that the categorical rule would not apply if the diminution in value were 95% instead of 100%. Anything less than a “complete elimination of value,” or a “total loss,” the Court acknowledged, would require the kind of analysis applied in <i>Penn Central.</i></p>
<p id="fbdd7a2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly, our holding that the permanent “obliteration of the value” of a fee simple estate constitutes a categorical taking does not answer the question whether a regulation prohibiting any economic use of land for a 32-month period has the same legal effect. Petitioners seek to bring this case under the rule announced in <i>Lucas</i> by arguing that we can effectively sever a 32-month segment from the remainder of each landowner’s fee simple estate, and then ask whether that segment has been taken in its entirety by the moratoria. Of course, defining the property interest taken in terms of the very regulation being <span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-665">p. 665</span>challenged is circular. With property so divided, every delay would become a total ban; the moratorium and the normal permit process alike would constitute categorical takings. Petitioners’ “conceptual severance” argument is unavailing because it ignores <i>Penn Central</i>’s admonition that in regulatory takings cases we must focus on “the parcel as a whole.” We have consistently rejected such an approach to the “denominator” question.</p>

<p id="fbdd7a2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he ultimate constitutional question is whether the concepts of “fairness and justice” that underlie the Takings Clause will be better served by [a] categorical rule or by a <i>Penn Central</i> inquiry into all of the relevant circumstances in particular cases. From that perspective, the extreme categorical rule that any deprivation of all economic use, no matter how brief, constitutes a compensable taking surely cannot be sustained. Petitioners’ broad submission would apply to numerous “normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like,” as well as to orders temporarily prohibiting access to crime scenes, businesses that violate health codes, fire-damaged buildings, or other areas that we cannot now foresee. Such a rule would undoubtedly require changes in numerous practices that have long been considered permissible exercises of the police power. As Justice Holmes warned in <i>Mahon</i>, “[g]overnment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.” A rule that required compensation for every delay in the use of property would render routine government processes prohibitively expensive or encourage hasty decisionmaking. Such an important change in the law should be the product of legislative rulemaking rather than adjudication.</p>
<p id="fbdd7a30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More importantly, we are persuaded that the better approach to claims that a regulation has effected a temporary taking “requires careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.” Our polestar remains the principles set forth in <i>Penn Central</i> itself and our other cases that govern partial regulatory takings. Under these cases, interference with investment-backed expectations is one of a number of factors that a court must examine.</p>
<p id="fbdda141-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have eschewed “any ‘set formula’ for determining when ‘justice and fairness’ require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.” The outcome instead “depends largely ‘upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.’”</p>
<p id="fbdda142-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The interest in facilitating informed decisionmaking by regulatory agencies counsels against adopting a per se rule that would impose such severe costs on their deliberations. Otherwise, the financial constraints of compensating property owners during a moratorium may force officials to rush through the planning process or to abandon the practice altogether. To the extent that communities are forced to abandon using moratoria, landowners will have incentives to develop their property quickly before a comprehensive plan can be enacted, thereby fostering inefficient and ill-conceived growth.</p>
<p id="fbdda143-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We would create a perverse system of incentives were we to hold that landowners must wait for a taking claim to ripen so that planners can make well-reasoned decisions while, at the same time, holding that those planners must compensate <span title="666" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-666">p. 666</span>landowners for the delay. Indeed, the interest in protecting the decisional process is even stronger when an agency is developing a regional plan than when it is considering a permit for a single parcel. In the proceedings involving the Lake Tahoe Basin, for example, the moratoria enabled TRPA to obtain the benefit of comments and criticisms from interested parties, such as the petitioners, during its deliberations. Since a categorical rule tied to the length of deliberations would likely create added pressure on decisionmakers to reach a quick resolution of land-use questions, it would only serve to disadvantage those landowners and interest groups who are not as organized or familiar with the planning process. Moreover, with a temporary ban on development there is a lesser risk that individual landowners will be “singled out” to bear a special burden that should be shared by the public as a whole. At least with a moratorium there is a clear “reciprocity of advantage,” because it protects the interests of all affected landowners against immediate construction that might be inconsistent with the provisions of the plan that is ultimately adopted. “While each of us is burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we, in turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions that are placed on others.” In fact, there is reason to believe property values often will continue to increase despite a moratorium. Such an increase makes sense in this context because property values throughout the Basin can be expected to reflect the added assurance that Lake Tahoe will remain in its pristine state. Since in some cases a 1-year moratorium may not impose a burden at all, we should not adopt a rule that assumes moratoria always force individuals to bear a special burden that should be shared by the public as a whole.</p>
<p id="fbdda144-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may well be true that any moratorium that lasts for more than one year should be viewed with special skepticism. But given the fact that the District Court found that the 32 months required by TRPA to formulate the 1984 Regional Plan was not unreasonable, we could not possibly conclude that every delay of over one year is constitutionally unacceptable. Formulating a general rule of this kind is a suitable task for state legislatures. In our view, the duration of the restriction is one of the important factors that a court must consider in the appraisal of a regulatory takings claim, but with respect to that factor as with respect to other factors, the “temptation to adopt what amount to per se rules in either direction must be resisted.” There may be moratoria that last longer than one year which interfere with reasonable investment-backed expectations, but as the District Court’s opinion illustrates, petitioners’ proposed rule is simply “too blunt an instrument,” for identifying those cases. We conclude, therefore, that the interest in “fairness and justice” will be best served by relying on the familiar <i>Penn Central</i> approach when deciding cases like this, rather than by attempting to craft a new categorical rule.</p>

Instead, it relies on the flawed determination of the Court of Appeals that the relevant time period lasted only from August 1981 until April 1984. During that period, Ordinance 81-5 and Regulation 83-21 prohibited development pending the adoption of a new regional land-use plan. The adoption of the 1984 Regional Plan (hereinafter Plan or 1984 Plan) did not, however, change anything from the petitioners’ standpoint. After the adoption of the 1984 Plan, petitioners still could make no use of their land. Because respondent caused petitioners’ inability to use their land from 1981 through 1987, that is the appropriate period of time from which to consider their takings claim.</p>

<p id="fbdda14b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I now turn to determining whether a ban on all economic development lasting almost six years is a taking. <i>Lucas</i> reaffirmed our “frequently expressed” view that “when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.” The District Court in this case held that the ordinances and resolutions in effect between August 24, 1981, and April 25, 1984, “did in fact deny the plaintiffs all economically viable use of their land.” The Court of Appeals did not overturn this finding. And the 1984 injunction, issued because the environmental thresholds issued by respondent did not permit the development of single-family residences, forced petitioners to leave their land economically idle for at least another three years. The Court does not dispute that petitioners were forced to leave their land economically idle during this period. But the Court refuses to apply <i>Lucas</i> on the ground that the deprivation was “temporary.”</p>
<p id="fbdda14c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither the Takings Clause nor our case law supports such a distinction. For one thing, a distinction between “temporary” and “permanent” prohibitions is tenuous. The “temporary” prohibition in this case that the Court finds is not a taking lasted almost six years. The “permanent” prohibition that the Court held to be a taking in <i>Lucas</i> lasted less than two years. Under the Court’s decision today, the takings question turns entirely on the initial label given a regulation, a label that is often without much meaning. There is every incentive for government to simply label any prohibition on development “temporary,” or to fix a set number of years. As in this case, this initial designation does not preclude the government from repeatedly extending the “temporary” prohibition into a long-term ban on all development. The Court now holds that such a designation by the government is conclusive even though in fact the moratorium greatly exceeds the time initially specified. Apparently, the Court would not view even a 10-year moratorium as a taking under <i>Lucas</i> because the moratorium is not “permanent.”</p>
<p id="fbddc85d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More fundamentally, even if a practical distinction between temporary and permanent deprivations were plausible, to treat the two differently in terms of takings law would be at odds with the justification for the <i>Lucas</i> rule. The <i>Lucas</i> <span title="668" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-668">p. 668</span>rule is derived from the fact that a “total deprivation of use is, from the landowner’s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation.” The regulation in <i>Lucas</i> was the “practical equivalence” of a long-term physical appropriation, i.e., a condemnation, so the Fifth Amendment required compensation.</p>
<p id="fbddc85e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lucas</i> is implicated when the government deprives a landowner of “all economically beneficial or productive use of land.” The District Court found, and the Court agrees, that the moratorium “temporarily” deprived petitioners of “‘all economically viable use of their land.’” Because the rationale for the <i>Lucas</i> rule applies just as strongly in this case, the “temporary” denial of all viable use of land for six years is a taking.</p>

<p id="fbddc860-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a regulation merely delays a final land use decision, we have recognized that there are other background principles of state property law that prevent the delay from being deemed a taking. We thus noted in <i>First English</i> that our discussion of temporary takings did not apply “in the case of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like.” Thus, the short-term delays attendant to zoning and permit regimes are a longstanding feature of state property law and part of a landowner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations.</p>
<p id="fbddc861-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But a moratorium prohibiting all economic use for a period of six years is not one of the longstanding, implied limitations of state property law. Moratoria are “interim controls on the use of land that seek to maintain the status quo with respect to land development in an area by either ‘freezing’ existing land uses or by allowing the issuance of building permits for only certain land uses that would not be inconsistent with a contemplated zoning plan or zoning change.”</p>
<p id="fbddc862-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the prohibition on development of nearly six years in this case cannot be said to resemble any “implied limitation” of state property law, it is a taking that requires compensation.</p>
<p id="fbddc863-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lake Tahoe is a national treasure and I do not doubt that respondent’s efforts at preventing further degradation of the lake were made in good faith in furtherance of the public interest. But, as is the case with most governmental action that furthers the public interest, the Constitution requires that the costs and burdens be borne by the public at large, not by a few targeted citizens. Justice Holmes’ admonition of 80 years ago again rings true: “We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.”</p>

<p id="fbddc866-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifth Amendment authorizes the government only to take private property for “public use.” If the taking were deemed to be for private use, the taking would be invalidated and the government would have to return the power to the owner. The Supreme Court often has declared that “one person’s property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying <span title="669" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-669">p. 669</span>public purpose, even though compensation be paid.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1108D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1108D_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span> The framers’ obvious concern was that the government might use its eminent domain power to play Robin Hood and take from some private owners and give to others.</p>
<p id="fbddc868-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Supreme Court has expansively defined “public use” so that virtually any taking will meet the requirement. The Court has held that it is a taking for public use so long as the government acts out of a reasonable belief that the taking will benefit the public. The Court reaffirmed this in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984).</p>
<p id="fbddc869-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Hawaii was concerned that so much land was owned by a relatively few people, a result of Hawaii’s precolonial property system, which restricted ownership to the islands’ chiefs and nobility. The state therefore used its eminent domain power to take the property, with just compensation, and with the plan of selling ownership to a much larger number of people. The owners were furious and argued that the government was impermissibly taking from some private owners to give to others.</p>
<p id="fbddef7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court unanimously found that this was a taking for public use. The Court reviewed Berman v. Parker and said that it establishes the proposition that “[t]he public use requirement is thus coterminous with the scope of a sovereign’s police powers.” The Court emphasized the need for great deference to the legislature in deciding whether a taking is for public use. Justice O’Connor, writing for the Court, said: “[T]he Court has made it clear that it will not substitute its judgment for a legislature’s judgment as to what constitutes a public use unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation.”</p>
<p id="fbddef7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court was explicit that a taking is for public use so long as the government meets the rational basis test. The Court declared: “[W]here the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, the Court has never held a compensated taking to be proscribed by the Public Use Clause.” The Court concluded that Hawaii’s action was for public use because it acted out of a reasonable belief that distributing ownership among a larger number of people would benefit the public.</p>
<p id="fbddef7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, and much more controversially, this issue arose in Kelo v. City of New London<i>.</i></p>

<p id="fbddef83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2000, the city of New London approved a development plan that, in the words of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, was “projected to create in excess of 1,000 jobs, to increase tax and other revenues, and to revitalize an economically distressed city, including its downtown and waterfront areas.” In assembling the land needed for this project, the city’s development agent has purchased property from willing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent domain to acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in exchange <span title="670" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-670">p. 670</span>for just compensation. The question presented is whether the city’s proposed disposition of this property qualifies as a “public use” within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbddef85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut. Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to designate the City a “distressed municipality.” In 1996, the Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had employed over 1,500 people. In 1998, the City’s unemployment rate was nearly double that of the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920.</p>
<p id="fbddef86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These conditions prompted state and local officials to target New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic revitalization. To this end, respondent New London Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning economic development, was reactivated. In January 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support the NLDC’s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park. In February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull; local planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby serving as a catalyst to the area’s rejuvenation. After receiving initial approval from the city council, the NLDC continued its planning activities and held a series of neighborhood meetings to educate the public about the process.</p>
<p id="fbddef87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city council approved the plan in January 2000, and designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of implementation. The city council also authorized the NLDC to purchase property or to acquire property by exercising eminent domain in the City’s name. The NLDC successfully negotiated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre area, but its negotiations with petitioners failed. As a consequence, in November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condemnation proceedings that gave rise to this case.</p>

<p id="fbddef8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two polar propositions are perfectly clear. On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party B, even though A is paid just compensation. On the other hand, it is equally clear that a State may transfer property from one private party to another if future “use by the public” is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of land for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar example. Neither of these propositions, however, determines the disposition of this case.</p>
<p id="fbddef8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the first proposition, the City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioners’ land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party. Nor would the City be allowed to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit. The takings before us, however, would be executed pursuant to a “carefully considered” development plan. The trial judge and all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case.</p>
<p id="fbde159d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is planning to open the condemned land—at least not in its entirety—to use by the general public. Nor will the private lessees of the land in any sense be required to operate like common carriers, making their services available to all comers. But although such a projected use would be sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement, this “Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public.” Indeed, while many state courts in the mid-19th century endorsed “use by the public” as the proper definition of public use, that narrow view steadily eroded over time. Not only was the “use by the public” test difficult to administer (e.g., what proportion of the public need have access to the property? at what price?), but it proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society. Accordingly, when this Court began applying the Fifth Amendment to the States at the close of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as “public purpose.”</p>
<p id="fbde159e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question whether the City’s development plan serves a “public purpose.” Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field.</p>
<p id="fbde159f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Berman v. Parker (1954), this Court upheld a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D.C., in which most of the housing for the area’s 5,000 inhabitants was beyond repair. Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it utilized for the construction of streets, schools, and other public facilities. The remainder of the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of redevelopment, including the construction of low-cost housing. The owner of a department store located in the area challenged the condemnation, pointing out that his store was not itself blighted and arguing that the creation of a “better balanced, more attractive community” was not a valid public use. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation, deferring instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area “must be planned as a whole” for the plan to <span title="672" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-672">p. 672</span>be successful. The Court explained that “community redevelopment programs need not, by force of the Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis—lot by lot, building by building.” The public use underlying the taking was unequivocally affirmed.</p>
<p id="fbde15a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff (1984), the Court considered a Hawaii statute whereby fee title was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees (for just compensation) in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership. We unanimously upheld the statute and rejected the Ninth Circuit’s view that it was “a naked attempt on the part of the state of Hawaii to take the property of A and transfer it to B solely for B’s private use and benefit.” Reaffirming <i>Berman</i>’s deferential approach to legislative judgments in this field, we concluded that the State’s purpose of eliminating the “social and economic evils of a land oligopoly” qualified as a valid public use. Our opinion also rejected the contention that the mere fact that the State immediately transferred the properties to private individuals upon condemnation somehow diminished the public character of the taking. “[I]t is only the taking’s purpose, and not its mechanics,” we explained, that matters in determining public use.</p>
<p id="fbde15a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed as a whole, our jurisprudence has recognized that the needs of society have varied between different parts of the Nation, just as they have evolved over time in response to changed circumstances. Our earliest cases in particular embodied a strong theme of federalism, emphasizing the “great respect” that we owe to state legislatures and state courts in discerning local public needs. For more than a century, our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power.</p>

<p id="fbde15a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who govern the City were not confronted with the need to remove blight in the Fort Trumbull area, but their determination that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference. The City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including—but by no means limited to—new jobs and increased tax revenue. As with other exercises in urban planning and development, the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts. To effectuate this plan, the City has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development. Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in <i>Berman</i>, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbde15a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use. Putting aside the unpersuasive suggestion that the City’s plan will provide only purely economic benefits, neither precedent nor logic supports petitioners’ proposal. Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of <span title="673" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-673">p. 673</span>government. There is, moreover, no principled way of distinguishing economic development from the other public purposes that we have recognized. In our cases upholding takings that facilitated agriculture and mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries to the welfare of the States in question. It would be incongruous to hold that the City’s interest in the economic benefits to be derived from the development of the Fort Trumbull area has less of a public character than any of those other interests. Clearly, there is no basis for exempting economic development from our traditionally broad understanding of public purpose.</p>
<p id="fbde15a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend that using eminent domain for economic development impermissibly blurs the boundary between public and private takings. Again, our cases foreclose this objection. Quite simply, the government’s pursuit of a public purpose will often benefit individual private parties.</p>
<p id="fbde15a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is further argued that without a bright-line rule nothing would stop a city from transferring citizen A’s property to citizen B for the sole reason that citizen B will put the property to a more productive use and thus pay more taxes. Such a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise. They do not warrant the crafting of an artificial restriction on the concept of public use.</p>
<p id="fbde15a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, petitioners maintain that for takings of this kind we should require a “reasonable certainty” that the expected public benefits will actually accrue. Such a rule, however, would represent an even greater departure from our precedent. “When the legislature’s purpose is legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make clear that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings—no less than debates over the wisdom of other kinds of socioeconomic legislation—are not to be carried out in the federal courts.”</p>
<p id="fbde15a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In affirming the City’s authority to take petitioners’ properties, we do not minimize the hardship that condemnations may entail, notwithstanding the payment of just compensation. We emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power. Indeed, many States already impose “public use” requirements that are stricter than the federal baseline. Some of these requirements have been established as a matter of state constitutional law, while others are expressed in state eminent domain statutes that carefully limit the grounds upon which takings may be exercised. As the submissions of the parties and their amici make clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate. This Court’s authority, however, extends only to determining whether the City’s proposed condemnations are for a “public use” within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Because over a century of our case law interpreting that provision dictates an affirmative answer to that question, we may not grant petitioners the relief that they seek.</p>
<p id="fbde15a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kennedy</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fbde15aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the opinion for the Court and add these further observations. This Court has declared that a taking should be upheld as consistent with the Public Use Clause, as long as it is “rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.” <span title="674" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-674">p. 674</span>Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff (1984); see also Berman v. Parker (1954). This deferential standard of review echoes the rational-basis test used to review economic regulation under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The determination that a rational-basis standard of review is appropriate does not, however, alter the fact that transfers intended to confer benefits on particular, favored private entities, and with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, are forbidden by the Public Use Clause.</p>
<p id="fbde15ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court applying rational-basis review under the Public Use Clause should strike down a taking that, by a clear showing, is intended to favor a particular private party, with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, just as a court applying rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause must strike down a government classification that is clearly intended to injure a particular class of private parties, with only incidental or pretextual public justifications.</p>
<p id="fbde15ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should treat the objection as a serious one and review the record to see if it has merit, though with the presumption that the government’s actions were reasonable and intended to serve a public purpose. Here, the trial court conducted a careful and extensive inquiry.</p>
<p id="fbde3cbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My agreement with the Court that a presumption of invalidity is not warranted for economic development takings in general, or for the particular takings at issue in this case, does not foreclose the possibility that a more stringent standard of review than that announced in <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i> might be appropriate for a more narrowly drawn category of takings. There may be private transfers in which the risk of undetected impermissible favoritism of private parties is so acute that a presumption (rebuttable or otherwise) of invalidity is warranted under the Public Use Clause. This demanding level of scrutiny, however, is not required simply because the purpose of the taking is economic development.</p>
<p id="fbde3cbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not the occasion for conjecture as to what sort of cases might justify a more demanding standard, but it is appropriate to underscore aspects of the instant case that convince me no departure from <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i> is appropriate here. This taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious city-wide depression, and the projected economic benefits of the project cannot be characterized as <i>de minimis</i>. The identity of most of the private beneficiaries were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans. The city complied with elaborate procedural requirements that facilitate review of the record and inquiry into the city’s purposes. In sum, while there may be categories of cases in which the transfers are so suspicious, or the procedures employed so prone to abuse, or the purported benefits are so trivial or implausible, that courts should presume an impermissible private purpose, no such circumstances are present in this case.</p>

A few instances will suffice to explain what I mean. . . . [A] law that takes property from A. and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a Legislature with SUCH powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it.” Calder v.

Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded—i.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public—in the process. To reason, as the Court does, that the incidental public benefits resulting from the subsequent ordinary use of private property render economic development takings “for public use” is to wash out any distinction between private and public use of property—and thereby effectively to delete the words “for public use” from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fbde3cc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public use requirement, in turn, imposes a more basic limitation, circumscribing the very scope of the eminent domain power: Government may compel an individual to forfeit her property for the public’s use, but not for the benefit of another private person. This requirement promotes fairness as well as security. Where is the line between “public” and “private” property use? We give considerable deference to legislatures’ determinations about what governmental activities will advantage the public. But were the political branches the sole arbiters of the public-private distinction, the Public Use Clause would amount to little more than hortatory fluff. An external, judicial check on how the public use requirement is interpreted, however limited, is necessary if this constraint on government power is to retain any meaning.</p>
<p id="fbde3cc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case returns us for the first time in over 20 years to the hard question of when a purportedly “public purpose” taking meets the public use requirement.

<p id="fbde3cc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here New London does not claim that Susette Kelo’s and Wilhelmina Dery’s well-maintained homes are the source of any social harm. Indeed, it could not so claim without adopting the absurd argument that any single-family home that might be razed to make way for an apartment building, or any church that might be replaced with a retail store, or any small business that might be more lucrative if it were instead part of a national franchise, is inherently harmful to society and thus within the government’s power to condemn.</p>
<p id="fbde3cc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public—such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words “for public use” do not realistically exclude any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.</p>
<p id="fbde3cc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if there were a practical way to isolate the motives behind a given taking, the gesture toward a purpose test is theoretically flawed. If it is true that incidental public benefits from new private use are enough to ensure the “public purpose” in a taking, why should it matter, as far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, what inspired the taking in the first place? How much the government does or does not desire to benefit a favored private party has no bearing on whether an economic development taking will or will not generate secondary <span title="676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-676">p. 676</span>benefit for the public.

<p id="fbde3cc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second proposed limitation is implicit in the Court’s opinion. The logic of today’s decision is that eminent domain may only be used to upgrade—not downgrade—property. At best this makes the Public Use Clause redundant with the Due Process Clause, which already prohibits irrational government action. The Court rightfully admits, however, that the judiciary cannot get bogged down in predictive judgments about whether the public will actually be better off after a property transfer. In any event, this constraint has no realistic import. For who among us can say she already makes the most productive or attractive possible use of her property? The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.</p>
<p id="fbde3cc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result. “[T]hat alone is a just government,” wrote James Madison, “which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own.”</p>

<p id="fbde63da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Long ago, William Blackstone wrote that “the law of the land . . . postpone[s] even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private property.” The Framers embodied that principle in the Constitution, allowing the government to take property not for “public necessity,” but instead for “public use.” Defying this understanding, the Court replaces the Public Use Clause with a “[P]ublic [P]urpose” Clause (or perhaps the “Diverse and Always Evolving Needs of Society” Clause), a restriction that is satisfied, the Court instructs, so long as the purpose is “legitimate” and the means “not irrational.” This deferential shift in phraseology enables the Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for a “public use.”</p>
<p id="fbde63db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I cannot agree. If such “economic development” takings are for a “public use,” any taking is, and the Court has erased the Public Use Clause from our Constitution, as Justice O’Connor powerfully argues in dissent. I do not believe that this Court can eliminate liberties expressly enumerated in the Constitution and therefore join her dissenting opinion.</p>
<p id="fbde63dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regrettably, however, the Court’s error runs deeper than this. Today’s decision is simply the latest in a string of our cases construing the Public Use Clause to be a virtual nullity, without the slightest nod to its original meaning. In my view, the Public Use Clause, originally understood, is a meaningful limit on the government’s eminent domain power. Our cases have strayed from the Clause’s original meaning, and I would reconsider them.</p>
<p id="fbde63dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no justification, however, for affording almost insurmountable deference to legislative conclusions that a use serves a “public use.” To begin with, a court owes no deference to a legislature’s judgment concerning the quintessentially <span title="677" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-677">p. 677</span>legal question of whether the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the taken property. Even under the “public purpose” interpretation, moreover, it is most implausible that the Framers intended to defer to legislatures as to what satisfies the Public Use Clause, uniquely among all the express provisions of the Bill of Rights. We would not defer to a legislature’s determination of the various circumstances that establish, for example, when a search of a home would be reasonable, or when a convicted double-murderer may be shackled during a sentencing proceeding without on-the-record findings, or when state law creates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fbde63de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The consequences of today’s decision are not difficult to predict, and promise to be harmful. So-called “urban renewal” programs provide some compensation for the properties they take, but no compensation is possible for the subjective value of these lands to the individuals displaced and the indignity inflicted by uprooting them from their homes. Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities. Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful. If ever there were justification for intrusive judicial review of constitutional provisions that protect “discrete and insular minorities,” United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), surely that principle would apply with great force to the powerless groups and individuals the Public Use Clause protects. The deferential standard this Court has adopted for the Public Use Clause is therefore deeply perverse. It encourages “those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms,” to victimize the weak.</p>
<p id="fbde63df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court relies almost exclusively on this Court’s prior cases to derive today’s far-reaching, and dangerous, result. But the principles this Court should employ to dispose of this case are found in the Public Use Clause itself, not in Justice Peckham’s high opinion of reclamation laws. When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution’s original meaning.</p>

One form of action is an “inverse condemnation suit,” where an individual claims that a government action constitutes a taking. In First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), the Supreme Court held that even if the government ceases its regulation in response to an inverse condemnation suit, the government nonetheless must pay damages for the time, however temporary, that it had taken the private property. In other words, the Court held that the government is required to pay just compensation for the entire time of its action, including the period before the judicial adjudication that it was a taking. The Court said that “[i]nvalidation of the ordinance . . . is not a sufficient remedy to meet the demands of the Just Compensation Clause.” Rather, the government must pay just compensation when there is a taking, even if it is a temporary taking.</p>

Some IOLTA programs were created by statute, but in Washington, as in most other States, the IOLTA program was established by the State Supreme Court pursuant to its authority to regulate the practice of law. In Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation (1998), a case involving the Texas IOLTA program, we held “that the interest income generated by funds held in IOLTA accounts is the ‘private property’ of the owner of the principal.” We did not, however, express any opinion on the question whether the income had been “taken” by the State or “as to the amount of ‘just compensation,’ if any, due respondents.” Ibid.

Before 1980 client funds were typically held in non-interest-bearing federally insured checking accounts. Because federal banking regulations in effect since the Great Depression prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts, the value of the use of the clients’ money in such accounts inured to the banking institutions. In 1980, Congress authorized federally insured banks to pay interest on a limited category of demand deposits referred to as “NOW accounts.”</p>
<p id="fbde8b05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to the change in federal law, Florida adopted the first IOLTA program in 1981 authorizing the use of NOW accounts for the deposit of client funds, and providing that all of the interest on such accounts be used for charitable purposes. Every State in the Nation and the District of Columbia have followed Florida’s lead and adopted an IOLTA program, either through their legislatures or their highest courts. The result is that, whereas before 1980 the banks retained the value of the use of the money deposited in non-interest-bearing client trust accounts, today, because of the adoption of IOLTA programs, that value is transferred to charitable entities providing legal services for the poor. The aggregate value of those contributions in 2001 apparently exceeded $200 million.</p>

Any conceivable net loss to petitioners was the consequence of the [lawyers’] incorrect private decisions rather than any state action.

A state law that requires client funds that could not otherwise generate net earnings for the client to be deposited in an IOLTA account is not a “regulatory taking.” A law that requires that the interest on those funds be transferred to a different owner for a legitimate public use, however, could be a per se taking requiring the payment of “just compensation” to the client. Because that compensation is measured by the owner’s pecuniary loss—which is zero whenever the Washington law is obeyed—there has been no violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment in this case.</p>

What is more, the Court embraces a line of reasoning that we explicitly rejected in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation (1998). Our precedents compel the conclusion that petitioners are entitled to the fair market value of the interest generated by their funds held in interest on lawyers’ trust accounts (IOLTA).</p>
<p id="fbdeb21e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a State has taken private property for a public use, the Fifth Amendment requires compensation in the amount of the market value of the property on the date it is appropriated. In holding that any just compensation that might be owed is zero, the Court neither pretends to ascertain the market value of the confiscated property nor asserts that the case falls within one of the two exceptions where market value need not be determined. Instead, the Court proclaims that just compensation is to be determined by the former property owner’s “net loss,” and endorses simultaneously two competing and irreconcilable theories of how that loss should be measured. The Court proclaims its agreement with the Ninth Circuit majority that just compensation is the interest petitioners would have earned had their funds been deposited in non-IOLTA accounts. At the same time, the Court approves the view of the Ninth Circuit dissenters that just compensation is the amount of interest actually earned in petitioners’ IOLTA accounts, minus the amount that would have been lost in transaction costs had petitioners sought to keep the money for themselves. The Court cannot have it both ways—as the Ninth Circuit itself realized.</p>
<p id="fbdeb21f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Court’s first theory, just compensation is zero because, under the State Supreme Court’s Rules, the only funds placed in IOLTA accounts are <span title="681" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-681">p. 681</span>those which could not have earned net interest for the client in a non-IOLTA savings account. This approach defines petitioners’ “net loss” as the amount of interest they would have received had their funds been deposited in separate, non-IOLTA accounts. This definition of just compensation has no foundation in reason. Once interest is earned on petitioners’ funds held in IOLTA accounts, that money is petitioners’ property. It is at that point that the State appropriates the interest to fund LFW—after the interest has been generated in the pooled accounts—and it is at that point that just compensation for the taking must be assessed. It may very well be, as the Court asserts, that petitioners could not have earned money on their funds absent IOLTA’s mandatory pooling arrangements, but just compensation is not to be measured by what would have happened in a hypothetical world in which the State’s IOLTA program did not exist. When the State takes possession of petitioners’ property—petitioners’ money—and transfers it to LFW, the property obviously has value. The conclusion that it is devoid of value because of the circumstances giving rise to its creation is indefensible.</p>
<p id="fbdeb220-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s rival theory for explaining why just compensation is zero fares no better. Contrary to its aforementioned description of petitioners’ “net loss” as the amount their funds would have earned in non-IOLTA accounts, the Court declares that just compensation is “the <i>net value</i> of the interest that was <i>actually earned</i> by petitioners”—net value consisting of the value of the funds, <i>less</i> “transaction and administrative costs and bank fees” that would be expended in extracting the funds from the IOLTA accounts. To support this concept of “net value,” the Court cites nothing but the cases discussed earlier in its opinion, which establish that just compensation consists of the value the owner has lost rather than the value the government has gained. In this case, however, there is no difference between the two. Petitioners have lost the interest that Phillips says rightfully belongs to them—which is precisely what the government has gained. The Court’s apparent fear that following the Constitution in this case will provide petitioners a “windfall” in the amount of transaction costs saved is based on the unfounded assumption that the State must return the interest directly to petitioners. The State could satisfy its obligation to pay just compensation by simply returning petitioners’ money to the IOLTA account from which it was seized, leaving others to incur the accounting costs in the event petitioners seek to extract their interest from the account.</p>
<p id="fbdeb221-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the Court is correct that under the State’s IOLTA rules, petitioners’ funds could not have earned net interest in separate, that has no bearing on the transaction costs that petitioners would sustain in removing their earned interest from the IOLTA accounts. The Court today arbitrarily forecloses clients from recovering the “net interest” to which (even under the Court’s definition of just compensation) they are entitled. What is more, there is no reason to believe that petitioners themselves do not fall within the class of clients whose funds, though unable to earn interest in non-IOLTA accounts, nevertheless generate “net interest” in IOLTA accounts. That is why the Ninth Circuit dissenters (who shared the Court’s second theory of just compensation but not the first) voted to remand to the District Court for a factual determination of what the “net value” of petitioners’ interest actually is.</p>
<p id="fbdeb222-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps we are witnessing today the emergence of a whole new concept in Compensation Clause jurisprudence: the Robin Hood Taking, in which the government’s extraction of wealth from those who own it is so cleverly achieved, and the object of the government’s larcenous beneficence is so highly favored <span title="682" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-682">p. 682</span>by the courts (taking from the rich to give to indigent defendants) that the normal rules of the Constitution protecting private property are suspended. One must hope that that is the case. For to extend to the entire run of Compensation Clause cases the rationale supporting today’s judgment—what the government hath given, the government may freely take away—would be disastrous. The Court’s judgment that petitioners are not entitled to the market value of their confiscated property has no basis in law.</p>

Ripeness, a requirement for a federal court to hear a case, is discussed in Chapter 1. In Williamson County Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), the Court held that a lawsuit challenging a taking was not ripe until after state administrative and judicial remedies were exhausted; it could not be said that a state had taken private property without just compensation if there were still mechanisms for the state to provide this. But in Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, 139 S. Ct. 2162 (2019), the Court overruled <i>Williamson County</i>, and held that a takings claim is ripe as soon as the taking occurs.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fbda45e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10A65_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N10A65_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span>&nbsp;Loretto v.

Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 668-669 (1887) (concluding that a state’s prohibition of alcoholic beverages was not a taking and declaring that “a prohibition . . . upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for the public benefit”).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fbdbf30e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10CEF_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N10CEF_ef81049e-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span>&nbsp;Justice Stevens criticizes the “deprivation of all economically beneficial use” rule as “wholly arbitrary,” in that “[the] landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing,” while the landowner who suffers a complete elimination of value “recovers in land’s full value.” This analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, “[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and . . . the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations” are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978). It is true that in at least some cases the landowner with 95% loss will get nothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. But that occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between the landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value by the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these “all-or-nothing” situations.
