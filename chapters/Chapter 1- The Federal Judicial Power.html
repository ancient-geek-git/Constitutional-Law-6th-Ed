<p id="fb6c683f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In studying constitutional law, you will be reading countless Supreme Court cases deciding the constitutionality of federal, state, and local laws and executive actions. Surprisingly, the Constitution is silent as to whether the Supreme Court and other federal courts have the authority to engage in such judicial review. In England, for example, both in 1787 and today, no English court has the authority to invalidate an act of Parliament. In 1787, the framers of the United States Constitution, in Philadelphia, did not discuss whether the federal judiciary should have the power of judicial review.</p>
<p id="fb6c6840-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authority for judicial review was first announced by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison in 1803.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1002D_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1002D_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> <i>Marbury</i> establishes the authority for judicial review of both federal executive and legislative acts. The historical background of the case is important in understanding the decision that follows. In November 1800, the incumbent president, John Adams, lost in a hotly contested election. Thomas Jefferson received a majority of the popular vote but tied in the Electoral College vote with Aaron Burr. Jefferson ultimately prevailed, based on a vote in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p id="fb6c8f52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adams was a Federalist, and the Federalists were determined to exercise their influence before the Republican, Jefferson, took office. In January 1801, Adams’s secretary of state, John Marshall, was named to serve as the third chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Throughout the remainder of Adams’s presidency, Marshall served as both secretary of state and chief justice.</p>
<p id="fb6c8f53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 13, 1801, Congress enacted the Circuit Judge Act, which reduced the number of Supreme Court justices from six to five, decreasing the opportunity for Republican control of the Court. The Act also eliminated the Supreme Court Justices’ duty to serve as circuit judges and created 16 new judgeships on the circuit courts. However, this change was short-lived; in 1802, Congress repealed this statute, restoring the practice of circuit riding by Supreme Court Justices and eliminating the newly created circuit court judgeships. The constitutionality of congressional abolition of judgeships was not tested in the courts.</p>
<p id="fb6c8f54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="2" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-2">p. 2</span>On February 27, 1801, less than a week before the end of Adams’s term, Congress adopted the Organic Act of the District of Columbia, which authorized the president to appoint 42 justices of the peace. Adams announced his nominations on March 2, and on March 3, the day before Jefferson’s inauguration, the Senate confirmed the nominees. Immediately, Secretary of State (and Chief Justice) John Marshall signed the commissions for these individuals and dispatched his brother, James Marshall, to deliver them. A few commissions, including one for William Marbury, were not delivered before Jefferson’s inauguration. President Jefferson instructed his secretary of state, James Madison, to withhold the undelivered commissions.</p>
<p id="fb6c8f55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">William Marbury filed suit in the U.S. Supreme Court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel Madison, as secretary of state, to deliver the commission. A writ of mandamus is a petition to a court asking it to order a government officer to perform a duty. Marbury claimed that the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court to grant mandamus in a proceeding filed initially in the Supreme Court. Although Marbury’s petition was filed in December 1801, the Supreme Court did not hear the case until 1803 because Congress, by statute, abolished the June and December 1802 Terms of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="fb6c8f56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reading Marbury v. Madison, it will be useful to focus on the following questions: (1) How does the Court justify judicial review of executive actions, and, according to the Court, when is such judicial review available and when is it unavailable? (2) Why does the Court find the Judiciary Act of 1789 unconstitutional? (3) How does the Court justify judicial review of legislative acts?</p>

<p id="fb6cb66d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following questions have been considered and decided.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="fb6cb66e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Has the applicant a right to the commission he demands?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="fb6cdd80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If they do afford him a remedy, is it a mandamus issuing from this court?</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="fb6cdd81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first object of inquiry is,</p>
<p id="fb6cdd82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Has the applicant a right to the commission he demands?</p>
<p id="fb6cdd83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an appointment made by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, and is evidenced by no act but the commission itself. In such a case therefore the commission and the appointment seem inseparable; it being almost impossible to show an appointment otherwise than by proving the existence of a commission: still the commission is not necessarily the appointment; though conclusive evidence of it.</p>
<p id="fb6cdd84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering this question, it has been conjectured that the commission may have been assimilated to a deed, to the validity of which, delivery is essential.</p>
<p id="fb6cdd85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has also occurred as possible, and barely possible, that the transmission of the commission, and the acceptance thereof, might be deemed necessary <span title="3" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-3">p. 3</span>to complete the right of the plaintiff. The transmission of the commission is a practice directed by convenience, but not by law.</p>
<p id="fb6cdd86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is therefore decidedly the opinion of the court, that when a commission has been signed by the president, the appointment is made; and that the commission is complete when the seal of the United States has been affixed to it by the secretary of state.</p>
<p id="fb6cdd87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To withhold the commission, therefore, is an act deemed by the court not warranted by law, but violative of a vested legal right.</p>
<p id="fb6cdd88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. If he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country afford him a remedy?</p>
<p id="fb6d0499-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of the first duties of government is to afford that protection.</p>
<p id="fb6d049a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right. It behooves us then to inquire whether there be in its composition any ingredient which shall exempt from legal investigation, or exclude the injured party from legal redress.</p>
<p id="fb6d049b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it in the nature of the transaction? Is the act of delivering or withholding a commission to be considered as a mere political act belonging to the executive department alone, for the performance of which entire confidence is placed by our constitution in the supreme executive; and for any misconduct respecting which, the injured individual has no remedy?</p>
<p id="fb6d049c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It follows then that the question, whether the legality of an act of the head of a department be examinable in a court of justice or not, must always depend on the nature of that act. If some acts be examinable, and others not, there must be some rule of law to guide the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="fb6d049d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance of these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority and in conformity with his orders.</p>
<p id="fb6d049e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive. The application of this remark will be perceived by adverting to the act of congress for establishing the department of foreign affairs. This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to conform precisely to the will of the president. He is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts.</p>
<p id="fb6d049f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But when the legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot at his discretion sport away the vested rights of others.</p>
<p id="fb6d04a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the <span title="4" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-4">p. 4</span>will of the president, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.</p>
<p id="fb6d2bb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question whether a right has vested or not, is, in its nature, judicial, and must be tried by the judicial authority. If, for example, Mr. Marbury had taken the oaths of a magistrate, and proceeded to act as one; in consequence of which a suit had been instituted against him, in which his defence had depended on his being a magistrate; the validity of his appointment must have been determined by judicial authority.</p>
<p id="fb6d2bb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, if he conceives that by virtue of his appointment he has a legal right either to the commission which has been made out for him or to a copy of that commission, it is equally a question examinable in a court, and the decision of the court upon it must depend on the opinion entertained of his appointment.</p>
<p id="fb6d2bb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It remains to be inquired whether,</p>
<p id="fb6d2bb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. He is entitled to the remedy for which he applies. This depends on,</p>

<p id="fb6d52cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one of the heads of departments commits any illegal act, under colour of his office, by which an individual sustains an injury, it cannot be pretended that his office alone exempts him from being sued in the ordinary mode of proceeding, and being compelled to obey the judgment of the law. How then can his office exempt him from this particular mode of deciding on the legality of his conduct, if the case be such a case as would, were any other individual the party complained of, authorize the process?</p>
<p id="fb6d79dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not by the office of the person to whom the writ is directed, but the nature of the thing to be done, that the propriety or impropriety of issuing a mandamus is to be determined.

<p id="fb6d79e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The secretary of state, being a person, holding an office under the authority of the United States, is precisely within the letter of the description; and if this court is not authorized to issue a writ of mandamus to such an officer, it must be because the law is unconstitutional, and therefore absolutely incapable of conferring the authority, and assigning the duties which its words purport to confer and assign.</p>
<p id="fb6d79e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the distribution of this power it is declared that “the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party. In all other cases, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="fb6d79e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been insisted at the bar, that as the original grant of jurisdiction to the supreme and inferior courts is general, and the clause, assigning original jurisdiction to the supreme court, contains no negative or restrictive words; the power remains to the legislature to assign original jurisdiction to that court in other cases than those specified in the article which has been recited; provided those cases belong to the judicial power of the United States.</p>
<p id="fb6d79e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If it had been intended to leave it in the discretion of the legislature to apportion the judicial power between the supreme and inferior courts according to the will of that body, it would certainly have been useless to have proceeded further than to have defined the judicial power, and the tribunals in which it should be vested. The subsequent part of the section is mere surplusage, is entirely without meaning, if such is to be the construction. If congress remains at liberty to give this court appellate jurisdiction, where the constitution has declared their jurisdiction shall be original; and original jurisdiction where the constitution has declared it shall be appellate; the distribution of jurisdiction made in the constitution, is form without substance.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect; and therefore such construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an instrument organizing fundamentally a judicial system, divides it into one supreme, and so many inferior courts as the legislature may ordain and establish; then enumerates its powers, and proceeds so far to distribute them, as to define the jurisdiction of the supreme court by declaring the cases in which it shall take original jurisdiction, and that in others it shall take appellate jurisdiction, the plain import of the words seems to be, that in one class of cases its jurisdiction is original, and not appellate; in the other it is appellate, and not original. If any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that is an additional reason for rejecting such other construction, and for adhering to the obvious meaning.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that case. Although, therefore, a mandamus may be directed to courts, yet to issue such a writ to an officer for the delivery of a paper, is in effect the same as to sustain <span title="6" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-6">p. 6</span>an original action for that paper, and therefore seems not to belong to appellate, but to original jurisdiction. Neither is it necessary in such a case as this, to enable the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authority, therefore, given to the supreme court, by the act establishing the judicial courts of the United States, to issue writs of mandamus to public officers, appears not to be warranted by the constitution; and it becomes necessary to inquire whether a jurisdiction, so conferred, can be exercised.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question, whether an act, repugnant to the constitution, can become the law of the land, is a question deeply interesting to the United States; but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. It seems only necessary to recognise certain principles, supposed to have been long and well established, to decide it.</p>
<p id="fb6da0f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This original and supreme will organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here; or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments.</p>
<p id="fb6da0fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing; if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act.</p>
<p id="fb6dc80b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.</p>
<p id="fb6dc80c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable.</p>
<p id="fb6dc80d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void.</p>
<p id="fb6dc80e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This theory is essentially attached to a written constitution, and is consequently to be considered by this court as one of the fundamental principles of our society. It is not therefore to be lost sight of in the further consideration of this subject.</p>
<p id="fb6dc80f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration.</p>
<p id="fb6dc810-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.</p>
<p id="fb6dc811-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="7" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-7">p. 7</span>So if a law be in opposition to the constitution: if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law: the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.</p>
<p id="fb6def22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If then the courts are to regard the constitution; and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.</p>
<p id="fb6def23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law.</p>
<p id="fb6def24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would declare that an act, which, according to the principles and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It would declare, that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure.</p>
<p id="fb6def25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions—a written constitution, would of itself be sufficient, in America where written constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence, for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions of the constitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favour of its rejection.</p>
<p id="fb6def26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitution.</p>
<p id="fb6def27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that, in using it, the constitution should not be looked into? That a case arising under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it arises? This is too extravagant to be maintained.</p>
<p id="fb6def28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases then, the constitution must be looked into by the judges. And if they can open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden to read, or to obey?</p>
<p id="fb6def29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many other parts of the constitution which serve to illustrate this subject.</p>
<p id="fb6e163a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitution declares that “no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.” If, however, such a bill should be passed and a person should be prosecuted under it, must the court condemn to death those victims whom the constitution endeavours to preserve?</p>
<p id="fb6e163b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“No person,” says the constitution, “shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.” Here the language of the constitution is addressed especially to the courts. It prescribes, directly for them, a rule of evidence not to be departed from. If the legislature should change that rule, and declare one witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient for conviction, must the constitutional principle yield to the legislative act?</p>
<p id="fb6e163c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From these and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature.</p>
<p id="fb6e163d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? This oath certainly applies, in an especial manner, to their conduct in their official <span title="8" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-8">p. 8</span>character. How immoral to impose it on them, if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support!</p>
<p id="fb6e163e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of the United States, if that constitution forms no rule for his government, if it is closed upon him and cannot be inspected by him?</p>
<p id="fb6e163f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is first mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution, have that rank.</p>
<p id="fb6e1640-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb6e3d52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">NOTES ON MARBURY v. MADISON</p></h3></div>

<p id="fb6e3d53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marbury v. Madison establishes a number of key propositions that continue to this day. First, it creates the authority for judicial review of executive actions. The Court draws a distinction between areas in which there are individual rights, and therefore government duties, and those in which the executive has discretion as to how to act. In the latter, the Court says that only the political process is the check on the executive branch.</p>
<p id="fb6e3d54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, <i>Marbury</i> establishes that Article III is the ceiling of federal court jurisdiction. The precise holding is that Congress cannot expand the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. More generally, <i>Marbury</i> stands for the proposition that Article III authorizes the maximum jurisdiction of the federal courts. As a result, Congress cannot authorize federal courts to hear cases beyond what is specified in Article III, and federal courts cannot gain jurisdiction by consent.</p>
<p id="fb6e3d55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, <i>Marbury</i> establishes the authority for judicial review of legislative acts. This, of course, is what Marbury v. Madison is most renowned for establishing. <i>Marbury</i> does this by declaring unconstitutional a provision of a federal law, the Judiciary Act of 1789, which the Court interprets as authorizing the Supreme Court to exercise mandamus on original jurisdiction. Yet a careful reading of that provision makes it questionable whether the provision authorizes this. The relevant portion of section 13 of the Judiciary Act stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb6e3d56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court shall also have appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts and courts of the several states, in the cases hereinafter specially provided for; . . . and shall have power to issue writs of prohibition . . . to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any court appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.</p>
</div>
<p id="fb6e3d57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute seems to be about appellate jurisdiction and not original jurisdiction. If the Court had interpreted the law this way, <i>Marbury</i> would have lost on jurisdictional grounds and the Court never would have had occasion to reach the issue of whether the Supreme Court can review the constitutionality of federal laws.</p>
<p id="fb6e6468-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="9" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-9">p. 9</span>That, of course, is part of the brilliance of Marbury v. Madison: Chief Justice John Marshall established judicial review while declaring unconstitutional a statute that he read as expanding the Court’s powers. Politically, Marshall had no choice but to deny Marbury relief; the Jefferson administration surely would have refused to comply with a court order to deliver the commission. In addition, there was a real possibility that Jefferson might seek the impeachment of the Federalist justices in an attempt to gain Republican control of the judiciary. One judge, albeit a clearly incompetent jurist, already had been impeached, and not long after his removal, the House of Representatives impeached Justice Samuel Chase on the grounds that he had made electioneering statements from the bench and had criticized the repeal of the 1801 Circuit Court Act. (Chase was acquitted in the Senate and remained on the Court until his death in 1811.) Yet John Marshall did more than simply rule in favor of the Jefferson administration; he used the occasion of deciding Marbury v. Madison to establish the power of the judiciary and to articulate a role for the federal courts that survives to this day.</p>
<p id="fb6e6469-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court did not declare another federal statute unconstitutional until 1857 in the infamous case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which invalidated the Missouri Compromise and helped to precipitate the Civil War.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101E6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101E6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> By then, the power of the Court to consider the constitutionality of federal laws was an accepted part of American government.</p>
<p id="fb6e646b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marbury v. Madison has been invoked by the Supreme Court in some of the most important cases in American history. For example, in Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court responded to Arkansas’s refusal to obey a federal court order desegregating the Little Rock public schools by relying on the authority of Marbury v. Madison. In an unusual opinion, signed individually by each justice, the Court rejected Arkansas’s position and emphatically declared: “Article VI of the Constitution makes the Constitution ‘the supreme Law of the Land.’ . . . Marbury v. Madison . . . declared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system. . . . Every state legislator and executive and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath . . . ‘to support this Constitution.’”</p>
<p id="fb6e646c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), the Supreme Court ordered President Richard Nixon to produce tapes of White House conversations in connection with the Watergate investigation. In response to the president’s claims that he alone should determine the scope of executive privilege, Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the Court, stated: “The President’s counsel . . . reads the Constitution as providing an absolute privilege of confidentiality for all Presidential communications. Many decisions of this Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury v. Madison that ‘[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.’”</p>
<p id="fb6e646d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marbury v. Madison thus provides the foundation for American constitutional law by establishing the authority for judicial review of executive and legislative acts.</p>

<p id="fb6e8b80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marbury v. Madison establishes only the authority for judicial review of federal executive and legislative actions. The authority for judicial review of state court decisions was established in two decisions early in the nineteenth century: Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee and Cohens v. Virginia.</p>
</div>
<div id="fb6e8b81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B">

<p id="fb6e8b82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MARTIN v. HUNTER’S LESSEE, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816): There were two competing claims to certain land within the state of Virginia. Martin claimed title to the land based on inheritance from Lord Fairfax, a British citizen who owned the property. The United States and England had entered into two treaties protecting the rights of British citizens to own land in the United States. However, Hunter claimed that Virginia had taken the land before the treaties came into effect and, hence, Martin did not have a valid claim to the property.</p>
<p id="fb6e8b83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Hunter and, in essence, in favor of the state’s authority to have taken and disposed of the land. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a writ of error and reversed the Virginia decision. The Supreme Court held that the federal treaty was controlling and that it established Lord Fairfax’s ownership and thus the validity of inheritance pursuant to his will. The Virginia Court of Appeals, however, declared that the Supreme Court lacked the authority to review state court decisions. The Virginia court stated that the “Courts of the United States, therefore, belonging to one sovereignty, cannot be appellate Courts in relation to the State Courts, which belong to a different sovereignty—and, of course, their commands or instructions impose no obligation.”</p>
<p id="fb6e8b84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court again granted review and declared the authority to review state court judgments. Justice Joseph Story wrote the opinion for the Court. Chief Justice John Marshall did not participate because he and his brother had contracted to purchase a large part of the Fairfax estate that was at issue in the litigation.</p>
<p id="fb6e8b85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Story argued that the structure of the Constitution presumes that the Supreme Court may review state court decisions. Story argued that the Constitution creates a Supreme Court and gives Congress discretion whether to create lower federal courts. But if Congress chose not to establish such tribunals, then the Supreme Court would be powerless to hear any cases, except for the few fitting within its original jurisdiction, unless it could review state court rulings.</p>
<p id="fb6e8b86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, Justice Story explained the importance of Supreme Court review of state courts. Justice Story said that although he assumed that “judges of the state courts are, and always will be, of as much learning, integrity, and wisdom as those of courts of the United States,” the Constitution is based on a recognition that “state attachments, state prejudices, state jealousies, and state interests might sometimes obstruct, or control, or be supposed to obstruct or control, the regular administration of justice.” Furthermore, Justice Story observed that Supreme Court review is essential to ensure uniformity in the interpretation of federal law. Justice Story concluded that the very nature of the Constitution, the contemporaneous understanding of it, and many years of experience all established the Supreme Court’s authority to review state court decisions.</p>

The defendants sought review in the United States Supreme Court because they claimed the Constitution prevented their prosecution for selling tickets authorized by Congress. Virginia argued: (1) in general, the Supreme Court had no authority to review state court decisions; and (2) in particular, review was not allowed in criminal cases and in cases where a state government was a party.</p>
<p id="fb6eb299-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall, reaffirmed the constitutionality of §25 of the Judiciary Act and the authority of the Supreme Court to review state court judgments. The Court emphasized that state courts often could not be trusted to adequately protect federal rights because “[i]n many States the judges are dependent for office and for salary on the will of the legislature.” The Court thus declared that criminal defendants could seek Supreme Court review when they claimed that their conviction violated the Constitution.</p>

<p id="fb6eb29c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judicial power to “say what the law is” gives to unelected federal judges great authority. There thus has been an ongoing, unresolved debate over how this power is constrained and whether the limits on judicial authority are sufficient. Three primary limits exist: interpretive limits, congressional limits, and justiciability limits. Interpretive limits raise the question of how the Constitution should be interpreted; some approaches seek to greatly narrow the judicial power, while others accord judges broad latitude in deciding the meaning of the Constitution. Congressional limits refer to the ability of Congress to restrict federal court jurisdiction. Justiciability limits refer to a series of judicially created doctrines that limit the types of matters that federal courts can decide.</p>

<p id="fb6eb29f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the Constitution is written in broad, open-textured language. How should the Court, or anyone seeking to interpret the Constitution, give meaning to these words? What weight should be given to the text, to the framers’ intent, to the practices at the time the constitutional provision was adopted, to tradition, to social policy needs? There is no agreement among Justices or scholars as to the appropriate method of constitutional interpretation. Yet the resolution of every issue of constitutional law turns on this question.</p>
<p id="fb6ed9b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue of how courts should interpret the Constitution is particularly controversial and, of course, at the core of the issues discussed throughout this book. On the one hand, some believe that it is essential that the Court’s discretion in interpreting the Constitution be narrowly circumscribed to limit the judicial power. They argue that democracy means rule by electorally accountable officials and that judicial review by unelected federal judges is inconsistent with this. The late Yale law professor Alexander Bickel said that judicial review is a “deviant institution in American democracy” because it permits unelected <span title="12" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-12">p. 12</span>judges to overturn the decisions of popularly accountable officials.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10260_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10260_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> Robert Bork similarly remarked that a “Court that makes rather than implements value choices cannot be squared with the presuppositions of a democratic society.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10269_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10269_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span></p>
<p id="fb6f27d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those adopting this approach seek to constrain courts interpreting the Constitution. Some argue, for example, that the Court is justified in protecting constitutional rights only if they are clearly stated in the text or the original understanding of the Constitution was to protect them. Those who adopt this theory, often called originalism, defend it as a desirable way to limit unelected judges in a democratic society.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10275_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10275_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span> Originalism is the view that “judges deciding constitutional issues should confine themselves to enforcing norms that are stated or clearly implicit in the written Constitution.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10283_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10283_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span></p>
<p id="fb6f27d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others disagree with these theories and argue that it is desirable for the Court to have substantial discretion in determining the meaning of the Constitution. Often called “nonoriginalists,” they argue that it is important that the Constitution evolve by interpretation and not only by amendment. Nonoriginalism is the “view that courts should go beyond that set of references and enforce norms that cannot be discovered within the four corners of the document.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1028F_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1028F_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span> The claim is that nonoriginalist review is essential so that the Constitution does not remain virtually static, so that it can evolve to meet the needs of a society that is advancing technologically and morally.</p>
<p id="fb6f4ee8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonoriginalists argued, for example, that equal protection in the second half of the twentieth century must mean that government-mandated racial segregation is unacceptable; yet there is strong evidence that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment approved this practice. The same Congress that ratified the Fourteenth Amendment also voted to segregate the District of Columbia public schools. The drafters of the Equal Protection Clause did not intend to protect women from discrimination, but it is widely accepted that the clause should apply to gender discrimination. Indeed, the argument is that under originalism it would be unconstitutional to elect a woman as president or vice president because the Constitution refers to these office holders with the word “he,” and the framers clearly intended that they be male.</p>
<p id="fb6f4ee9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Originalists believe that the Court should find a right to exist in the Constitution only if it is expressly stated in the text or was clearly intended by its framers. If the Constitution is silent, originalists say it is for the legislature, unconstrained by the courts, to decide the law. Nonoriginalists think that it is permissible for the Court to interpret the Constitution to protect rights that are not expressly stated or clearly intended. Originalists believe that the Constitution should evolve solely by amendment; nonoriginalists believe that the Constitution’s meaning can evolve by amendment and by interpretation.</p>
<p id="fb6f4eea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But within these theories there is a wide range of different approaches. Some originalists argue that the framers’ specific intent must be followed, while others maintain that only the framers’ abstract intent is controlling. Justice Scalia argued that the focus should not be on the framers’ intentions, but on the meaning of the Constitution as evidenced by the text and the practices at the time the Constitution was ratified. Similarly, among nonoriginalists there are <span title="13" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-13">p. 13</span>those who emphasize tradition, those who stress natural law principles, those who say constitutional law should be about improving the processes of government, those who emphasize contemporary values, and other variants too.</p>
<p id="fb6f4eeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For several decades now there has been an intense debate among justices and among scholars as to the appropriate method for interpreting the Constitution. There is a voluminous literature on this. The debate over how the Constitution should be interpreted—and the extent to which the method of interpretation should limit the judiciary—arises in all areas of constitutional law.</p>

<p id="fb6f75fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In thinking about the debate over the appropriate method of interpretation, consider, as an example, the meaning of the Second Amendment, which states: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” There is a heated debate among scholars, as well as in society, about the proper interpretation of the Second Amendment. On the one hand, some believe that the Second Amendment safeguards a right of individuals to keep and own firearms. From this perspective, laws that infringe this right are at least presumptively unconstitutional. On the other hand, some believe that the Second Amendment means only that there is a right to have guns for militia service.</p>
<p id="fb6f75ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The underlying issue, of course, is how should the Supreme Court—or a lower court or a member of Congress or you—decide the proper meaning of the Second Amendment. In June 2008, for the first time in U.S. history, the Supreme Court invalidated a law as violating the Second Amendment and held that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns apart from militia service.</p>

<p id="fb6f9d19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District of Columbia generally prohibits the possession of handguns. It is a crime to carry an unregistered firearm, and the registration of handguns is prohibited. Wholly apart from that prohibition, no person may carry a handgun without a license, but the chief of police may issue licenses for 1-year periods. District of Columbia law also requires residents to keep their lawfully owned firearms, such as registered long guns, “unloaded and dissembled or bound by <span title="14" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-14">p. 14</span>a trigger lock or similar device” unless they are located in a place of business or are being used for lawful recreational activities.</p>

<p id="fb6fc42e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Second Amendment provides: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” In interpreting this text, we are guided by the principle that “[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning.”</p>
<p id="fb6fc42f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two sides in this case have set out very different interpretations of the Amendment. Petitioners and today’s dissenting Justices believe that it protects only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia service. Respondent argues that it protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.</p>
<p id="fb6fc430-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be rephrased, “Because a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” Although this structure of the Second Amendment is unique in our Constitution, other legal documents of the founding era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state constitutions, commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose.</p>
<p id="fb6fc431-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Logic demands that there be a link between the stated purpose and the command. The Second Amendment would be nonsensical if it read, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to petition for redress of grievances shall not be infringed.” But apart from that clarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb6feb42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">1. Operative Clause</p></div>
<p id="fb6feb43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">a. “Right of the People.” The first salient feature of the operative clause is that it codifies a “right of the people.” The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the phrase “right of the people” two other times, in the First <span title="15" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-15">p. 15</span>Amendment’s Assembly-and-Petition Clause and in the Fourth Amendment’s Search-and-Seizure Clause. The Ninth Amendment uses very similar terminology. All three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not “collective” rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body.</p>
<p id="fb6feb44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is more, in all six other provisions of the Constitution that mention “the people,” the term unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset. This contrasts markedly with the phrase “the militia” in the prefatory clause. As we will describe below, the “militia” in colonial America consisted of a subset of “the people”—those who were male, able bodied, and within a certain age range. Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to “keep and bear Arms” in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause’s description of the holder of that right as “the people.”</p>
<p id="fb6feb45-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start therefore with a strong presumption that the Second Amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans.</p>
<p id="fb6feb46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">b. “Keep and bear Arms.” We move now from the holder of the right—“the people”—to the substance of the right: “to keep and bear Arms.”</p>
<p id="fb6feb47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before addressing the verbs “keep” and “bear,” we interpret their object: “Arms.” The 18th-century meaning is no different from the meaning today. The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary defined “arms” as “weapons of offence, or armour of defence.” Timothy Cunningham’s important 1771 legal dictionary defined “arms” as “any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.” The term was applied, then as now, to weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity.</p>
<p id="fb6feb48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.</p>
<p id="fb701259-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to the phrases “keep arms” and “bear arms.” Johnson defined “keep” as, most relevantly, “[t]o retain; not to lose,” and “[t]o have in custody.” Webster defined it as “[t]o hold; to retain in one’s power or possession.” No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of “keep Arms.” Thus, the most natural reading of “keep Arms” in the Second Amendment is to “have weapons.”</p>
<p id="fb70125a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The phrase “keep arms” was not prevalent in the written documents of the founding period that we have found, but there are a few examples, all of which favor viewing the right to “keep Arms” as an individual right unconnected with militia service.</p>
<p id="fb70125b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From our review of founding-era sources, we conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that “bear arms” had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, “bear arms” was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. The most prominent examples are those most relevant to the Second Amendment: Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens to “bear arms in defense of themselves and the state” or “bear <span title="16" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-16">p. 16</span>arms in defense of himself and the state.” It is clear from those formulations that “bear arms” did not refer only to carrying a weapon in an organized military unit.</p>
<p id="fb70125c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens places great weight on James Madison’s inclusion of a conscientious-objector clause in his original draft of the Second Amendment: “but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.” He argues that this clause establishes that the drafters of the Second Amendment intended “bear Arms” to refer only to military service. It is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process. In any case, what Justice Stevens would conclude from the deleted provision does not follow. It was not meant to exempt from military service those who objected to going to war but had no scruples about personal gunfights. Thus, the most natural interpretation of Madison’s deleted text is that those opposed to carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation would not be “compelled to render military service,” in which such carrying would be required.</p>
<p id="fb70125d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Justice Stevens suggests that “keep and bear Arms” was some sort of term of art, presumably akin to “hue and cry” or “cease and desist.” This suggestion usefully evades the problem that there is no evidence whatsoever to support a military reading of “keep arms.” And even if “keep and bear Arms” were a unitary phrase, we find no evidence that it bore a military meaning. Although the phrase was not at all common (which would be unusual for a term of art), we have found instances of its use with a clearly nonmilitary connotation.</p>
<p id="fb70125e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">c. Meaning of the Operative Clause. Putting all of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it “shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p id="fb70125f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms. Of course the right was not unlimited, just as the First Amendment’s right of free speech was not. Thus, we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose.</p>

<p id="fb703971-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prefatory clause reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State. . . .”</p>

Miller (1939), we explained that “the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.” That definition comports with founding-era sources.</p>
<p id="fb703973-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners take a seemingly narrower view of the militia, stating that “[m]ilitias are the state- and congressionally-regulated military forces described in the Militia Clauses (art. I, §8, cls. 15-16).” Although we agree with petitioners’ interpretive assumption that “militia” means the same thing in Article I and the Second Amendment, we believe that petitioners identify the wrong thing, <span title="17" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-17">p. 17</span>namely, the organized militia. Unlike armies and navies, which Congress is given the power to create (“to raise . . . Armies”; “to provide . . . a Navy,” Art. I, §8, cls. 12-13), the militia is assumed by Article I already to be in existence. Congress is given the power to “provide for calling forth the militia,” §8, cl. 15; and the power not to create, but to “organiz[e]” it—and not to organize “a” militia, which is what one would expect if the militia were to be a federal creation, but to organize “the” militia, connoting a body already in existence, ibid., cl. 16. This is fully consistent with the ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men. Finally, the adjective “well-regulated” implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.</p>
<p id="fb703974-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">b. “Security of a Free State.” The phrase “security of a free state” meant “security of a free polity,” not security of each of the several States as the dissent below argued. There are many reasons why the militia was thought to be “necessary to the security of a free state.” First, of course, it is useful in repelling invasions and suppressing insurrections. Second, it renders large standing armies -unnecessary—an argument that Alexander Hamilton made in favor of federal control over the militia. Third, when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny.</p>

<p id="fb703976-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach the question, then: Does the preface fit with an operative clause that creates an individual right to keep and bear arms? It fits perfectly, once one knows the history that the founding generation knew and that we have described above. That history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able-bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people’s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents. This is what had occurred in England that prompted codification of the right to have arms in the English Bill of Rights.</p>
<p id="fb703977-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is therefore entirely sensible that the Second Amendment’s prefatory clause announces the purpose for which the right was codified: to prevent elimination of the militia. The prefatory clause does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self-defense and hunting. But the threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens’ militia by taking away their arms was the reason that right—unlike some other English rights— was codified in a written Constitution.</p>

<p id="fb706089-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed adoption of the Second Amendment. Four States adopted analogues to the Federal Second Amendment in the period between independence and the ratification of the Bill of Rights. Two of them—Pennsylvania and Vermont—clearly adopted individual rights unconnected to militia service.</p>
<p id="fb70608a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">North Carolina also codified a right to bear arms in 1776. Many colonial statutes required individual arms-bearing for public-safety reasons—such as the 1770 Georgia law that “for the security and defence of this province from internal dangers and insurrections” required those men who qualified for militia duty individually “to carry fire arms” “to places of public worship.”</p>
<p id="fb70608b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="18" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-18">p. 18</span>We therefore believe that the most likely reading of all four of these pre-Second Amendment state constitutional provisions is that they secured an individual right to bear arms for defensive purposes.</p>
<p id="fb70608c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between 1789 and 1820, nine States adopted Second Amendment analogues. The historical narrative that petitioners must endorse would thus treat the Federal Second Amendment as an odd outlier, protecting a right unknown in state constitutions or at English common law, based on little more than an overreading of the prefatory clause.</p>

<p id="fb70608e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens relies on the drafting history of the Second Amendment—the various proposals in the state conventions and the debates in Congress. It is dubious to rely on such history to interpret a text that was widely understood to codify a preexisting right, rather than to fashion a new one. But even assuming that this legislative history is relevant, Justice Stevens flatly misreads the historical record.</p>
<p id="fb70608f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, as Justice Stevens says, that there was concern that the Federal Government would abolish the institution of the state militia. That concern found expression, however, not in the various Second Amendment precursors proposed in the State conventions, but in separate structural provisions that would have given the States concurrent and seemingly nonpreemptible authority to organize, discipline, and arm the militia when the Federal Government failed to do so.</p>

<p id="fb7087a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now address how the Second Amendment was interpreted from immediately after its ratification through the end of the 19th century. Three important founding-era legal scholars interpreted the Second Amendment in published writings. All three understood it to protect an individual right unconnected with militia service. We have found only one early 19th-century commentator who clearly conditioned the right to keep and bear arms upon service in the militia—and he recognized that the prevailing view was to the contrary.</p>
<p id="fb7087a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 19th-century cases that interpreted the Second Amendment universally support an individual right unconnected to militia service. Many early 19th-century state cases indicated that the Second Amendment right to bear arms was an individual right unconnected to militia service, though subject to certain restrictions.</p>
<p id="fb7087a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the aftermath of the Civil War, there was an outpouring of discussion of the Second Amendment in Congress and in public discourse, as people debated whether and how to secure constitutional rights for newly free slaves. Since those discussions took place 75 years after the ratification of the Second Amendment, they do not provide as much insight into its original meaning as earlier sources. Yet those born and educated in the early 19th century faced a widespread effort to limit arms ownership by a large number of citizens; their understanding of the origins and continuing significance of the Amendment is instructive.</p>
<p id="fb7087a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Blacks were routinely disarmed by Southern States after the Civil War. Those who opposed these injustices frequently stated that they infringed blacks’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Needless to say, the claim was not that blacks were being prohibited from carrying arms in an organized state militia. It was plainly the understanding in the post-Civil War Congress that the <span title="19" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-19">p. 19</span>Second Amendment protected an individual right to use arms for self-defense. Every late-19th-century legal scholar that we have read interpreted the Second Amendment to secure an individual right unconnected with militia service.</p>

<p id="fb7087a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now ask whether any of our precedents forecloses the conclusions we have reached about the meaning of the Second Amendment. Justice Stevens places overwhelming reliance upon this Court’s decision in United States v. Miller (1939). <i>Miller</i> did not hold that and cannot possibly be read to have held that. The judgment in the case upheld against a Second Amendment challenge two men’s federal convictions for transporting an unregistered short-barreled shotgun in interstate commerce, in violation of the National Firearms Act. It is entirely clear that the Court’s basis for saying that the Second Amendment did not apply was not that the defendants were “bear[ing] arms” not “for . . . military purposes” but for “nonmilitary use.” Rather, it was that the type of weapon at issue was not eligible for Second Amendment protection. Beyond that, the opinion provided no explanation of the content of the right.</p>
<p id="fb7087a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This holding is not only consistent with, but positively suggests, that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms (though only arms that “have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia”). Had the Court believed that the Second Amendment protects only those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the two crooks were not militiamen. <i>Miller</i> stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons.</p>
<p id="fb70aeb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is particularly wrongheaded to read <i>Miller</i> for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment. The respondent made no appearance in the case, neither filing a brief nor appearing at oral argument; the Court heard from no one but the Government.</p>
<p id="fb70aeb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that nothing in our precedents forecloses our adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amendment.</p>

<p id="fb70aebb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</p>
<p id="fb70aebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. <i>Miller</i> said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected <span title="20" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-20">p. 20</span>were those “in common use at the time.” We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of “dangerous and unusual weapons.”</p>

<p id="fb70aebe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn finally to the law at issue here. As we have said, the law totally bans handgun possession in the home. It also requires that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it inoperable.</p>
<p id="fb70aebf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of “arms” that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute. Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights, banning from the home “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family,” would fail constitutional muster.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer moves on to make a broad jurisprudential point: He criticizes us for declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating Second Amendment restrictions. He proposes, explicitly at least, none of the traditionally expressed levels (strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis), but rather a judge-empowering “interest-balancing inquiry” that “asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute’s salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.”</p>
<p id="fb70d4d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding “interest-balancing” approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an “interest-balancing” approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people—which Justice Breyer would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer chides us for leaving so many applications of the right to keep and bear arms in doubt, and for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible. But since this case represents this Court’s first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field. And there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="21" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-21">p. 21</span>In sum, we hold that the District’s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the District must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country, and we take seriously the concerns raised by the many amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution. The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns. But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table. These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home. Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented by this case is not whether the Second Amendment protects a “collective right” or an “individual right.” Surely it protects a right that can be enforced by individuals. But a conclusion that the Second Amendment protects an individual right does not tell us anything about the scope of that right.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Guns are used to hunt, for self-defense, to commit crimes, for sporting activities, and to perform military duties. The Second Amendment plainly does not protect the right to use a gun to rob a bank; it is equally clear that it does encompass the right to use weapons for certain military purposes. Whether it also protects the right to possess and use guns for nonmilitary purposes like hunting and personal self-defense is the question presented by this case. The text of the Amendment, its history, and our decision in United States v. Miller (1939), provide a clear answer to that question.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Second Amendment was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia. It was a response to concerns raised during the ratification of the Constitution that the power of Congress to disarm the state militias and create a national standing army posed an intolerable threat to the sovereignty of the several States. Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature’s authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb70d4d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1934, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act, the first major federal firearms law. Upholding a conviction under that Act, this Court held that, “[i]n the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a ‘shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length’ at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.” United States v. Miller. The view of the <span title="22" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-22">p. 22</span>Amendment we took in <i>Miller</i>—that it protects the right to keep and bear arms for certain military purposes, but that it does not curtail the Legislature’s power to regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons—is both the most natural reading of the Amendment’s text and the interpretation most faithful to the history of its adoption.</p>
<p id="fb70fbea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since our decision in <i>Miller</i>, hundreds of judges have relied on the view of the Amendment we endorsed there; we ourselves affirmed it in 1980. See Lewis v. United States (1980). No new evidence has surfaced since 1980 supporting the view that the Amendment was intended to curtail the power of Congress to regulate civilian use or misuse of weapons. Indeed, a review of the drafting history of the Amendment demonstrates that its Framers rejected proposals that would have broadened its coverage to include such uses.</p>
<p id="fb70fbeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the textual and historical arguments on both sides of the issue were evenly balanced, respect for the well-settled views of all of our predecessors on this Court, and for the rule of law itself, would prevent most jurists from endorsing such a dramatic upheaval in the law.</p>
<p id="fb70fbec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this dissent I shall first explain why our decision in <i>Miller</i> was faithful to the text of the Second Amendment and the purposes revealed in its drafting history. I shall then comment on the postratification history of the Amendment, which makes abundantly clear that the Amendment should not be interpreted as limiting the authority of Congress to regulate the use or possession of firearms for purely civilian purposes.</p>

<p id="fb70fbee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text of the Second Amendment is brief. It provides: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p id="fb70fbef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three portions of that text merit special focus: the introductory language defining the Amendment’s purpose, the class of persons encompassed within its reach, and the unitary nature of the right that it protects.</p>
<p id="fb70fbf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State”</p>
<p id="fb712301-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preamble to the Second Amendment makes three important points. It identifies the preservation of the militia as the Amendment’s purpose; it explains that the militia is necessary to the security of a free State; and it recognizes that the militia must be “well regulated.” In all three respects it is comparable to provisions in several State Declarations of Rights that were adopted roughly contemporaneously with the Declaration of Independence. Those state provisions highlight the importance members of the founding generation attached to the maintenance of state militias; they also underscore the profound fear shared by many in that era of the dangers posed by standing armies.</p>
<p id="fb712302-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preamble thus both sets forth the object of the Amendment and informs the meaning of the remainder of its text. Such text should not be treated as mere surplusage, for “[i]t cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.” Marbury v. Madison (1803).</p>
<p id="fb712303-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today tries to denigrate the importance of this clause of the Amendment by beginning its analysis with the Amendment’s operative provision <span title="23" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-23">p. 23</span>and returning to the preamble merely “to ensure that our reading of the operative clause is consistent with the announced purpose.” That is not how this Court ordinarily reads such texts, and it is not how the preamble would have been viewed at the time the Amendment was adopted.</p>
<p id="fb712304-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The right of the people”</p>
<p id="fb712305-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The centerpiece of the Court’s textual argument is its insistence that the words “the people” as used in the Second Amendment must have the same meaning, and protect the same class of individuals, as when they are used in the First and Fourth Amendments. According to the Court, in all three provisions—as well as the Constitution’s preamble, “the term unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset.” But the Court itself reads the Second Amendment to protect a “subset” significantly narrower than the class of persons protected by the First and Fourth Amendments; when it finally drills down on the substantive meaning of the Second Amendment, the Court limits the protected class to “law-abiding, responsible citizens.” But the class of persons protected by the First and Fourth Amendments is not so limited; for even felons (and presumably irresponsible citizens as well) may invoke the protections of those constitutional provisions. The Court offers no way to harmonize its conflicting pronouncements.</p>
<p id="fb712306-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“To keep and bear Arms”</p>
<p id="fb712307-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Court’s discussion of these words treats them as two “phrases”—as if they read “to keep” and “to bear”—they describe a unitary right: to possess arms if needed for military purposes and to use them in conjunction with military activities.</p>
<p id="fb712308-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term “bear arms” is a familiar idiom; when used unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is “to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight.” 1 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989). It is derived from the Latin arma ferre, which, translated literally, means “to bear [ferre] war equipment [arma].”</p>
<p id="fb714a19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Amendment’s use of the term “keep” in no way contradicts the military meaning conveyed by the phrase “bear arms” and the Amendment’s preamble. To the contrary, a number of state militia laws in effect at the time of the Second Amendment’s drafting used the term “keep” to describe the requirement that militia members store their arms at their homes, ready to be used for service when necessary. The Virginia military law, for example, ordered that “every one of the said officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, shall constantly keep the aforesaid arms, accoutrements, and ammunition, ready to be produced whenever called for by his commanding officer.” “[K]eep and bear arms” thus perfectly describes the responsibilities of a framing-era militia member.</p>
<p id="fb714a1a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia. So far as appears, no more than that was contemplated by its drafters or is encompassed within its terms. Even if the meaning of the text were genuinely susceptible to more than one interpretation, the burden would remain on those advocating a departure <span title="24" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-24">p. 24</span>from the purpose identified in the preamble and from settled law to come forward with persuasive new arguments or evidence. The textual analysis offered by respondent and embraced by the Court falls far short of sustaining that heavy burden.</p>
<p id="fb714a1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, not a word in the constitutional text even arguably supports the Court’s overwrought and novel description of the Second Amendment as “elevat[ing] above all other interests” “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.”</p>

<p id="fb714a1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proper allocation of military power in the new Nation was an issue of central concern for the Framers. The compromises they ultimately reached, reflected in Article I’s Militia Clauses and the Second Amendment, represent quintessential examples of the Framers’ “splitting the atom of sovereignty.”</p>
<p id="fb714a1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is strikingly significant that Madison’s first draft omitted any mention of nonmilitary use or possession of weapons. Rather, his original draft repeated the essence of the two proposed amendments sent by Virginia, combining the substance of the two provisions succinctly into one, which read: “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed, and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.”</p>
<p id="fb714a1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Madison’s decision to model the Second Amendment on the distinctly military Virginia proposal is therefore revealing, since it is clear that he considered and rejected formulations that would have unambiguously protected civilian uses of firearms. When Madison prepared his first draft, and when that draft was debated and modified, it is reasonable to assume that all participants in the drafting process were fully aware of the other formulations that would have protected civilian use and possession of weapons and that their choice to craft the Amendment as they did represented a rejection of those alternative formulations.</p>
<p id="fb714a20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Madison’s initial inclusion of an exemption for conscientious objectors sheds revelatory light on the purpose of the Amendment. It confirms an intent to describe a duty as well as a right, and it unequivocally identifies the military character of both. The objections voiced to the conscientious-objector clause only confirm the central meaning of the text.</p>
<p id="fb714a21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of the adoption of the Amendment thus describes an overriding concern about the potential threat to state sovereignty that a federal standing army would pose, and a desire to protect the States’ militias as the means by which to guard against that danger. But state militias could not effectively check the prospect of a federal standing army so long as Congress retained the power to disarm them, and so a guarantee against such disarmament was needed. The evidence plainly refutes the claim that the Amendment was motivated by the Framers’ fears that Congress might act to regulate any civilian uses of weapons. And even if the historical record were genuinely ambiguous, the burden would remain on the parties advocating a change in the law to introduce facts or arguments “‘newly ascertained[]’”; the Court is unable to identify any such facts or arguments.</p>

<p id="fb717133-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, it has been understood that legislatures may regulate the civilian use and misuse of firearms so long as they do not interfere with the preservation of a well-regulated militia. The Court’s announcement of a new constitutional right to own and use firearms for private purposes upsets that settled understanding, but leaves for future cases the formidable task of defining the scope of permissible regulations. Today judicial craftsmen have confidently asserted that a policy choice that denies a “law-abiding, responsible citize[n]” the right to keep and use weapons in the home for self-defense is “off the table.” Given the presumption that most citizens are law abiding, and the reality that the need to defend oneself may suddenly arise in a host of locations outside the home, I fear that the District’s policy choice may well be just the first of an unknown number of dominoes to be knocked off the table.</p>
<p id="fb717134-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not know whether today’s decision will increase the labor of federal judges to the “breaking point” envisioned by Justice Cardozo, but it will surely give rise to a far more active judicial role in making vitally important national policy decisions than was envisioned at any time in the 18th, 19th, or 20th centuries.</p>
<p id="fb717135-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court properly disclaims any interest in evaluating the wisdom of the specific policy choice challenged in this case, but it fails to pay heed to a far more important policy choice—the choice made by the Framers themselves. The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons, and to authorize this Court to use the common-law process of case-by-case judicial lawmaking to define the contours of acceptable gun control policy. Absent compelling evidence that is nowhere to be found in the Court’s opinion, I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.</p>
<p id="fb717136-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb717137-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must decide whether a District of Columbia law that prohibits the possession of handguns in the home violates the Second Amendment. The majority, relying upon its view that the Second Amendment seeks to protect a right of personal self-defense, holds that this law violates that Amendment. In my view, it does not.</p>
</div><div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb717138-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">I</p></div>
<p id="fb717139-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s conclusion is wrong for two independent reasons. The first reason is that set forth by Justice Stevens—namely, that the Second Amendment protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests. These two interests are sometimes intertwined. To assure 18th-century citizens that they could keep arms for militia purposes would necessarily have allowed them to keep arms that they could have used for self-defense as well. But self-defense alone, detached from any militia-related objective, is not the Amendment’s concern.</p>
<p id="fb71984a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second independent reason is that the protection the Amendment provides is not absolute. The Amendment permits government to regulate the interests that it serves. Thus, irrespective of what those interests are—whether <span title="26" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-26">p. 26</span>they do or do not include an independent interest in self-defense—the majority’s view cannot be correct unless it can show that the District’s regulation is unreasonable or inappropriate in Second Amendment terms. This the majority cannot do.</p>
<p id="fb71984b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In respect to the first independent reason, I agree with Justice Stevens, and I join his opinion. In this opinion I shall focus upon the second reason. I shall show that the District’s law is consistent with the Second Amendment even if that Amendment is interpreted as protecting a wholly separate interest in individual self-defense. That is so because the District’s regulation, which focuses upon the presence of handguns in high-crime urban areas, represents a permissible legislative response to a serious, indeed life-threatening, problem.</p>
<p id="fb71984c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus I here assume that one objective (but, as the majority concedes, not the primary objective) of those who wrote the Second Amendment was to help assure citizens that they would have arms available for purposes of self-defense. Even so, a legislature could reasonably conclude that the law will advance goals of great public importance, namely, saving lives, preventing injury, and reducing crime. The law is tailored to the urban crime problem in that it is local in scope and thus affects only a geographic area both limited in size and entirely urban; the law concerns handguns, which are specially linked to urban gun deaths and injuries, and which are the overwhelmingly favorite weapon of armed criminals; and at the same time, the law imposes a burden upon gun owners that seems proportionately no greater than restrictions in existence at the time the Second Amendment was adopted. In these circumstances, the District’s law falls within the zone that the Second Amendment leaves open to regulation by legislatures.</p>
</div><div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb71984d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">[II]</p></div>
<p id="fb71984e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I therefore begin by asking a process-based question: How is a court to determine whether a particular firearm regulation (here, the District’s restriction on handguns) is consistent with the Second Amendment? What kind of constitutional standard should the court use? How high a protective hurdle does the Amendment erect?</p>
<p id="fb71984f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question matters. The majority is wrong when it says that the District’s law is unconstitutional “[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights.” How could that be? It certainly would not be unconstitutional under, for example, a “rational basis” standard, which requires a court to uphold regulation so long as it bears a “rational relationship” to a “legitimate governmental purpose.” The law at issue here, which in part seeks to prevent gun-related accidents, at least bears a “rational relationship” to that “legitimate” life-saving objective.</p>
<p id="fb719850-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent proposes that the Court adopt a “strict scrutiny” test, which would require reviewing with care each gun law to determine whether it is “narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.” But the majority implicitly, and appropriately, rejects that suggestion by broadly approving a set of laws—prohibitions on concealed weapons, forfeiture by criminals of the Second Amendment right, prohibitions on firearms in certain locales, and governmental regulation of commercial firearm sales—whose constitutionality under a strict scrutiny standard would be far from clear.</p>
<p id="fb719851-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="27" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-27">p. 27</span>Indeed, adoption of a true strict-scrutiny standard for evaluating gun regulations would be impossible. That is because almost every gun-control regulation will seek to advance (as the one here does) a “primary concern of every government—a concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.” The Court has deemed that interest, as well as “the Government’s general interest in preventing crime,” to be “compelling,” and the Court has in a wide variety of constitutional contexts found such public-safety concerns sufficiently forceful to justify restrictions on individual liberties. Thus, any attempt in theory to apply strict scrutiny to gun regulations will in practice turn into an interest-balancing inquiry, with the interests protected by the Second Amendment on one side and the governmental public-safety concerns on the other, the only question being whether the regulation at issue impermissibly burdens the former in the course of advancing the latter.</p>
<p id="fb71bf62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would simply adopt such an interest-balancing inquiry explicitly. The fact that important interests lie on both sides of the constitutional equation suggests that review of gun-control regulation is not a context in which a court should effectively presume either constitutionality (as in rational-basis review) or unconstitutionality (as in strict scrutiny). Rather, “where a law significantly implicates competing constitutionally protected interests in complex ways,” the Court generally asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute’s salutary effects upon other important governmental interests. Any answer would take account both of the statute’s effects upon the competing interests and the existence of any clearly superior less restrictive alternative. Contrary to the majority’s unsupported suggestion that this sort of “proportionality” approach is unprecedented, the Court has applied it in various constitutional contexts, including election-law cases, speech cases, and due process cases.</p>
<p id="fb71bf63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying this kind of standard the Court normally defers to a legislature’s empirical judgment in matters where a legislature is likely to have greater expertise and greater institutional factfinding capacity. Nonetheless, a court, not a legislature, must make the ultimate constitutional conclusion, exercising its “independent judicial judgment” in light of the whole record to determine whether a law exceeds constitutional boundaries.</p>

<p id="fb71bf65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one doubts the constitutional importance of the statute’s basic objective, saving lives. But there is considerable debate about whether the District’s statute helps to achieve that objective.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb71bf66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fb71bf67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, consider the facts as the legislature saw them when it adopted the District statute. As stated by the local council committee that recommended its adoption, the major substantive goal of the District’s handgun restriction is “to reduce the potentiality for gun-related crimes and gun-related deaths from occurring within the District of Columbia.” The committee concluded, on the basis of “extensive public hearings” and “lengthy research,” that “[t]he easy availability of firearms in the United States has been a major factor contributing to the drastic increase in gun-related violence and crime over the past 40 years.” It <span title="28" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-28">p. 28</span>reported to the Council “startling statistics,” regarding gun-related crime, accidents, and deaths, focusing particularly on the relation between handguns and crime and the proliferation of handguns within the District.</p>
<p id="fb71bf68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The committee informed the Council that guns were “responsible for 69 deaths in this country each day,” for a total of “[a]pproximately 25,000 gun-deaths . . . each year,” along with an additional 200,000 gun-related injuries. Three thousand of these deaths, the report stated, were accidental. A quarter of the victims in those accidental deaths were children under the age of 14. And according to the committee, “[f]or every intruder stopped by a homeowner with a firearm, there are 4 gun-related accidents within the home.”</p>
<p id="fb71bf69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In respect to local crime, the committee observed that there were 285 murders in the District during 1974—a record number. The committee report furthermore presented statistics strongly correlating handguns with crime. Of the 285 murders in the District in 1974, 155 were committed with handguns. This did not appear to be an aberration, as the report revealed that “handguns [had been] used in roughly 54% of all murders” (and 87% of murders of law enforcement officers) nationwide over the preceding several years. Nor were handguns only linked to murders, as statistics showed that they were used in roughly 60% of robberies and 26% of assaults. “A crime committed with a pistol,” the committee reported, “is 7 times more likely to be lethal than a crime committed with any other weapon.” The committee furthermore presented statistics regarding the availability of handguns in the United States, and noted that they had “become easy for juveniles to obtain,” even despite then-current District laws prohibiting juveniles from possessing them.</p>
<p id="fb71e67a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, consider the facts as a court must consider them looking at the matter as of today.</p>
<p id="fb71e67b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From 1993 to 1997, there were 180,533 firearm-related deaths in the United States, an average of over 36,000 per year. Over that same period there were an additional 411,800 nonfatal firearm-related injuries treated in U.S. hospitals, an average of over 82,000 per year. Of these, 62% resulted from assaults, 17% were unintentional, 6% were suicide attempts, 1% were legal interventions, and 13% were of unknown causes.</p>
<p id="fb71e67c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statistics are particularly striking in respect to children and adolescents. In over one in every eight firearm-related deaths in 1997, the victim was someone under the age of 20. Firearm-related deaths account for 22.5% of all injury deaths between the ages of 1 and 19. More male teenagers die from firearms than from all natural causes combined. Persons under 25 accounted for 47% of hospital-treated firearm injuries between June 1, 1992, and May 31, 1993.</p>
<p id="fb71e67d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Handguns are involved in a majority of firearm deaths and injuries in the United States. From 1993 to 1997, 81% of firearm-homicide victims were killed by handgun. In the same period, for the 41% of firearm injuries for which the weapon type is known, 82% of them were from handguns. Firearm Injury and Death From Crime 4. And among children under the age of 20, handguns account for approximately 70% of all unintentional firearm-related injuries and deaths. In particular, 70% of all firearm-related teenage suicides in 1996 involved a handgun.</p>
<p id="fb71e67e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Handguns also appear to be a very popular weapon among criminals. In a 1997 survey of inmates who were armed during the crime for which they were incarcerated, 83.2% of state inmates and 86.7% of federal inmates said that they were armed with a handgun. Statistics further suggest that urban areas, such <span title="29" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-29">p. 29</span>as the District, have different experiences with gun-related death, injury, and crime, than do less densely populated rural areas. A disproportionate amount of violent and property crimes occur in urban areas, and urban criminals are more likely than other offenders to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.</p>
<p id="fb71e67f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the linkage of handguns to firearms deaths and injuries appears to be much stronger in urban than in rural areas. “[S]tudies to date generally support the hypothesis that the greater number of rural gun deaths are from rifles or shotguns, whereas the greater number of urban gun deaths are from handguns.”</p>
<p id="fb71e680-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider the claim of respondent’s amici that handgun bans cannot work; there are simply too many illegal guns already in existence for a ban on legal guns to make a difference. In a word, they claim that, given the urban sea of pre-existing legal guns, criminals can readily find arms regardless. Nonetheless, a legislature might respond, we want to make an effort to try to dry up that urban sea, drop by drop. And none of the studies can show that effort is not worthwhile.</p>
<p id="fb71e681-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a word, the studies to which respondent’s amici point raise policy-related questions. They succeed in proving that the District’s predictive judgments are controversial. But they do not by themselves show that those judgments are incorrect; nor do they demonstrate a consensus, academic or otherwise, supporting that conclusion.</p>
<p id="fb71e682-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it is not surprising that the District and its amici support the District’s handgun restriction with studies of their own. One in particular suggests that, statistically speaking, the District’s law has indeed had positive life-saving effects. See Loftin, McDowall, Weirsema, &amp; Cottey, Effects of Restrictive Licensing of Handguns on Homicide and Suicide in the District of Columbia, 325 New England J. Med. 1615 (1991). Others suggest that firearm restrictions as a general matter reduce homicides, suicides, and accidents in the home. Still others suggest that the defensive uses of handguns are not as great in number as respondent’s amici claim.</p>
<p id="fb71e683-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent and his amici reply to these responses; and in doing so, they seek to discredit as methodologically flawed the studies and evidence relied upon by the District. The upshot is a set of studies and counterstudies that, at most, could leave a judge uncertain about the proper policy conclusion. But from respondent’s perspective any such uncertainty is not good enough. That is because legislators, not judges, have primary responsibility for drawing policy conclusions from empirical fact. And, given that constitutional allocation of decisionmaking responsibility, the empirical evidence presented here is sufficient to allow a judge to reach a firm legal conclusion.</p>
<p id="fb720d94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In particular this Court, in First Amendment cases applying intermediate scrutiny, has said that our “sole obligation” in reviewing a legislature’s “predictive judgments” is “to assure that, in formulating its judgments,” the legislature “has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.” And judges, looking at the evidence before us, should agree that the District legislature’s predictive judgments satisfy that legal standard. That is to say, the District’s judgment, while open to question, is nevertheless supported by “substantial evidence.”</p>
<p id="fb720d95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no cause here to depart from [that] standard for the District’s decision represents the kind of empirically based judgment that legislatures, not courts, are best suited to make. In fact, deference to legislative judgment seems <span title="30" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-30">p. 30</span>particularly appropriate here, where the judgment has been made by a local legislature, with particular knowledge of local problems and insight into appropriate local solutions.</p>
<p id="fb720d96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, I conclude that the District’s statute properly seeks to further the sort of life-preserving and public-safety interests that the Court has called “compelling.”</p>

<p id="fb720d98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I next assess the extent to which the District’s law burdens the interests that the Second Amendment seeks to protect. Respondent and his amici, as well as the majority, suggest that those interests include: (1) the preservation of a “well regulated Militia”; (2) safeguarding the use of firearms for sporting purposes, e.g., hunting and marksmanship; and (3) assuring the use of firearms for self-defense. For argument’s sake, I shall consider all three of those interests here.</p>
<p id="fb720d99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District’s statute burdens the Amendment’s first and primary objective hardly at all. As previously noted, there is general agreement among the Members of the Court that the principal (if not the only) purpose of the Second Amendment is found in the Amendment’s text: the preservation of a “well regulated Militia.” What scant Court precedent there is on the Second Amendment teaches that the Amendment was adopted “[w]ith obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of [militia] forces” and “must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.”</p>
<p id="fb720d9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority briefly suggests that the “right to keep and bear Arms” might encompass an interest in hunting. But in enacting the present provisions, the District sought “to take nothing away from sportsmen.” And any inability of District residents to hunt near where they live has much to do with the jurisdiction’s exclusively urban character and little to do with the District’s firearm laws. [T]he District’s law does not prohibit possession of rifles or shotguns, and the presence of opportunities for sporting activities in nearby States. [T]he District’s law burdens any sports-related or hunting-related objectives that the Amendment may protect little, or not at all.</p>
<p id="fb720d9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District’s law does prevent a resident from keeping a loaded handgun in his home. And it consequently makes it more difficult for the householder to use the handgun for self-defense in the home against intruders, such as burglars. As the Court of Appeals noted, statistics suggest that handguns are the most popular weapon for self defense. To that extent the law burdens to some degree an interest in self-defense that for present purposes I have assumed the Amendment seeks to further.</p>

<p id="fb7234ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In weighing needs and burdens, we must take account of the possibility that there are reasonable, but less restrictive alternatives. Are there other potential measures that might similarly promote the same goals while imposing lesser restrictions? Here I see none.</p>
<p id="fb7234ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason there is no clearly superior, less restrictive alternative to the District’s handgun ban is that the ban’s very objective is to reduce significantly the number of handguns in the District, say, for example, by allowing a law enforcement officer immediately to assume that any handgun he sees is an illegal handgun. And there is no plausible way to achieve that objective other than to ban the guns.<span title="31" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-31">p. 31</span></p>

<p id="fb7234b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is that the District’s objectives are compelling; its predictive judgments as to its law’s tendency to achieve those objectives are adequately supported; the law does impose a burden upon any self-defense interest that the Amendment seeks to secure; and there is no clear less restrictive alternative. I turn now to the final portion of the “permissible regulation” question: Does the District’s law disproportionately burden Amendment-protected interests? Several considerations, taken together, convince me that it does not.</p>
<p id="fb7234b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the District law is tailored to the life-threatening problems it attempts to address. The law concerns one class of weapons, handguns, leaving residents free to possess shotguns and rifles, along with ammunition. The area that falls within its scope is totally urban. That urban area suffers from a serious handgun-fatality problem. The District’s law directly aims at that compelling problem. And there is no less restrictive way to achieve the problem-related benefits that it seeks.</p>
<p id="fb7234b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the self-defense interest in maintaining loaded handguns in the home to shoot intruders is not the primary interest, but at most a subsidiary interest, that the Second Amendment seeks to serve. The Second Amendment’s language, while speaking of a “Militia,” says nothing of “self-defense.”</p>
<p id="fb725bc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, any self-defense interest at the time of the Framing could not have focused exclusively upon urban-crime related dangers. Two hundred years ago, most Americans, many living on the frontier, would likely have thought of self-defense primarily in terms of outbreaks of fighting with Indian tribes, rebellions such as Shays’ Rebellion, marauders, and crime-related dangers to travelers on the roads, on footpaths, or along waterways. Insofar as the Framers focused at all on the tiny fraction of the population living in large cities, they would have been aware that these city dwellers were subject to firearm restrictions that their rural counterparts were not. They are unlikely then to have thought of a right to keep loaded handguns in homes to confront intruders in urban settings as central. And the subsequent development of modern urban police departments, by diminishing the need to keep loaded guns nearby in case of intruders, would have moved any such right even further away from the heart of the amendment’s more basic protective ends.</p>
<p id="fb725bc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor, for that matter, am I aware of any evidence that handguns in particular were central to the Framers’ conception of the Second Amendment. The lists of militia-related weapons in the late 18th-century state statutes appear primarily to refer to other sorts of weapons, muskets in particular.</p>
<p id="fb725bc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, irrespective of what the Framers could have thought, we know what they did think. Samuel Adams, who lived in Boston, advocated a constitutional amendment that would have precluded the Constitution from ever being “construed” to “prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.” And he doubtless knew that Massachusetts law prohibited Bostonians from keeping loaded guns in the house. So how could Samuel Adams have advocated such protection unless he thought that the protection was consistent with local regulation that seriously impeded urban residents from using their arms against intruders? It seems unlikely that he meant to deprive the Federal Government of power (to enact Boston-type weapons regulation) that he kn[e]w Boston had and (as far as we know) he would have thought constitutional under the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb725bc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-32">p. 32</span>Fourth, a contrary view, as embodied in today’s decision, will have unfortunate consequences. The decision will encourage legal challenges to gun regulation throughout the Nation. Because it says little about the standards used to evaluate regulatory decisions, it will leave the Nation without clear standards for resolving those challenges. And litigation over the course of many years, or the mere specter of such litigation, threatens to leave cities without effective protection against gun violence and accidents during that time. As important, the majority’s decision threatens severely to limit the ability of more knowledgeable, democratically elected officials to deal with gun-related problems. But I cannot understand how one can take from the elected branches of government the right to decide whether to insist upon a handgun-free urban populace in a city now facing a serious crime problem and which, in the future, could well face environmental or other emergencies that threaten the breakdown of law and order.</p>
<p id="fb725bc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, I conclude that the District’s measure is a proportionate, not a disproportionate, response to the compelling concerns that led the District to adopt it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105B6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105B6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span></p>

<p id="fb7282d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interestingly, in the decade after <i>Heller</i>, the Court did not take or decide any cases concerning the meaning of the Second Amendment despite many opportunities to do so. The lower courts have divided on many issues, such as whether there is a right to have guns outside the home. The Court’s composition has changed since 2008 with Justices Souter, Stevens, Scalia, and Kennedy being replaced by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. But the sense is that the current Court likely will be similarly split 5-4 between the views of the Second Amendment expressed in <i>Heller</i>.</p>

<p id="fb72a9f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In large part, the debate centers on two major constitutional issues: What does the language of Article III mean when it says that Supreme Court jurisdiction exists subject to such “exceptions and regulations” as Congress shall make? Does separation of powers limit the ability of Congress to restrict Supreme Court jurisdiction?</p>
<div id="fb72a9f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb72d106-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>THE EXCEPTIONS AND REGULATIONS CLAUSE</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fb72d107-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even after more than 200 years of American history, there is no consensus as to what the Constitution means when it provides that the Supreme Court possesses appellate jurisdiction “both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.” On one side of the debate are those who believe that this provides Congress with broad powers to remove matters from the Supreme Court’s purview. The argument, in part, is that the framers of the Constitution intended such congressional control as a check on the judiciary’s power.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10624_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10624_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span> Evidence of this intent, it is argued, is found in the fact that the first Congress did not vest the Supreme Court with appellate jurisdiction over all of the types of cases and controversies enumerated in Article III. For example, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court had authority only to review decisions of a state’s highest court that ruled against a federal constitutional claim.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10632_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10632_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span> It was not until the twentieth century that the Supreme Court was accorded power to review decisions of a state court that ruled in favor of a constitutional right.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1063E_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1063E_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">17</a></span></p>

Under <span title="34" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-34">p. 34</span>this view, Congress could create an exception to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction for review of matters of fact, but Congress could not eliminate the Court’s appellate jurisdiction for issues of law.</p>
<p id="fb72d10d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, it is argued that even though Congress is given authority to limit Supreme Court jurisdiction under the text of Article III, this power—like all congressional powers—cannot be used in a manner that violates the Constitution. Opponents of jurisdiction restriction contend that congressional preclusion of Supreme Court review of particular topics would violate other parts of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb72f81e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary Supreme Court case interpreting the Exceptions and Regulations Clause is Ex parte McCardle.

McCardle filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to a statute adopted in 1867 that permitted federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to anyone held in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States by either a state government or the federal government. Before 1867, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was supplemented but not replaced by the 1867 law, federal courts could hear habeas petitions only of those who were held in federal custody.</p>
<p id="fb72f825-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCardle contended that the Military Reconstruction Act was unconstitutional in that it provided for military trials for civilians. He also claimed that his prosecution violated specific Bill of Rights’ provisions, including the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The U.S. government argued that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to grant habeas corpus to McCardle under the 1867 act. The federal government read the 1867 statute, despite its language to the contrary, as providing federal court relief only for state prisoners. The Supreme Court rejected this contention and set the case for argument on the merits of McCardle’s claim that the Military Reconstruction Act and his prosecution were unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fb731f36-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 9, 1868, the Supreme Court held oral arguments on McCardle’s constitutional claims. Three days later, on March 12, 1868, Congress adopted a rider to an inconsequential tax bill that repealed that part of the 1867 statute that authorized Supreme Court appellate review of writs of habeas corpus. Members of Congress stated that their purpose was to remove the <i>McCardle</i> case from the Supreme Court’s docket and thus prevent the Court from potentially invalidating Reconstruction. Representative Wilson declared that the “amendment [repealing Supreme Court authority under the 1867 act is] aimed at striking at a branch of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court . . . thereby sweeping the [<i>McCardle</i>] case from the docket by taking away the jurisdiction of the Court.”</p>

This was five days before the Senate was scheduled to begin its impeachment trial of President Johnson and the grounds for impeachment focused solely on his alleged obstruction of Reconstruction.

<p id="fb731f3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is unnecessary to consider whether, if Congress had made no exceptions and no regulations, this court might not have exercised general appellate jurisdiction under rules prescribed by itself. The exception to appellate jurisdiction in the case before us, however, is not an inference from the affirmation of other appellate jurisdiction. It is made in terms. The provision of the act of 1867, affirming the appellate jurisdiction of this court in cases of habeas corpus is expressly repealed.

Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.

<p id="fb731f3f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is quite clear, therefore, that this court cannot proceed to pronounce judgment in this case, for it has no longer jurisdiction of the appeal; and judicial duty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws confer.</p>
<p id="fb734650-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel seem to have supposed, if effect be given to the repealing act in question, that the whole appellate power of the court, in cases of habeas corpus, is denied.

<p id="fb736d6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to this decision and frequent pardons issued by the president, Congress quickly adopted a statute providing that a pardon was inadmissible as evidence in a claim for return of seized property. Moreover, the statute provided that a pardon, without an express disclaimer of guilt, was proof that the person aided the rebellion and would deny the federal courts jurisdiction over the claims. The statute declared that upon “proof of such pardon . . . the jurisdiction of the court in the case shall cease, and the court shall forthwith dismiss the suit of such claimant.”]</p>

<p id="fb736d6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The substance of this enactment is that an acceptance of a pardon, without disclaimer, shall be conclusive evidence of the acts pardoned, but shall be null and void as evidence of the rights conferred by it, both in the Court of Claims and in this court on appeal.</p>
<p id="fb736d6e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was urged in argument that the right to sue the government in the Court of Claims is a matter of favor; but this seems not entirely accurate. It is as much the duty of the government as of individuals to fulfil its obligations. Before the establishment of the Court of Claims claimants could only be heard by Congress. That court was established in 1855 for the triple purpose of relieving Congress, and of protecting the government by regular investigation, and of benefiting the claimants by affording them a certain mode of examining and adjudicating upon their claims. It was required to hear and determine upon claims founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States.</p>
<p id="fb736d6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="37" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-37">p. 37</span>Undoubtedly the legislature has complete control over the organization and existence of that court and may confer or withhold the right of appeal from its decisions. And if this act did nothing more, it would be our duty to give it effect. If it simply denied the right of appeal in a particular class of cases, there could be no doubt that it must be regarded as an exercise of the power of Congress to make “such exceptions from the appellate jurisdiction” as should seem to it expedient.</p>
<p id="fb736d70-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the language of the proviso shows plainly that it does not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as a means to an end. Its great and controlling purpose is to deny to pardons granted by the President the effect which this court had adjudged them to have. The proviso declares that pardons shall not be considered by this court on appeal. We had already decided that it was our duty to consider them and give them effect, in cases like the present, as equivalent to proof of loyalty. It provides that whenever it shall appear that any judgment of the Court of Claims shall have been founded on such pardons, without other proof of loyalty, the Supreme Court shall have no further jurisdiction of the case and shall dismiss the same for want of jurisdiction. The proviso further declares that every pardon granted to any suitor . . . if accepted in writing without disclaimer of the fact recited, be taken as conclusive evidence in that court and on appeal, of the act recited; and on proof of pardon or acceptance, summarily made on motion or otherwise, the jurisdiction of the court shall cease and the suit shall be forthwith dismissed.</p>
<p id="fb736d71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident from this statement that the denial of jurisdiction to this court, as well as to the Court of Claims, is founded solely on the application of a rule of decision, in causes pending, prescribed by Congress. The court has jurisdiction of the cause to a given point; but when it ascertains that a certain state of things exists, its jurisdiction is to cease and it is required to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="fb736d72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems to us that this is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of Congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power.</p>
<p id="fb736d73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court is required to ascertain the existence of certain facts and thereupon to declare that its jurisdiction on appeal has ceased, by dismissing the bill. What is this but to prescribe a rule for the decision of a cause in a particular way? In the case before us, the Court of Claims has rendered judgment for the claimant and an appeal has been taken to this court. We are directed to dismiss the appeal, if we find that the judgment must be affirmed, because of a pardon granted to the intestate of the claimants. Can we do so without allowing one party to the controversy to decide it in its own favor? Can we do so without allowing that the legislature may prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it?</p>
<p id="fb736d74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must think that Congress has inadvertently passed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power. It is of vital importance that these powers be kept distinct. The Constitution provides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and such inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish. The same instrument, in the last clause of the same article, provides that in all cases other than those of original jurisdiction, “the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.”</p>
<p id="fb736d75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="38" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-38">p. 38</span>Congress has already provided that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction of the judgments of the Court of Claims on appeal. Can it prescribe a rule in conformity with which the court must deny to itself the jurisdiction thus conferred, because and only because its decision, in accordance with settled law, must be adverse to the government and favorable to the suitor? This question seems to us to answer itself.</p>
<p id="fb736d76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule prescribed is also liable to just exception as impairing the effect of a pardon, and thus infringing the constitutional power of the Executive. It is the intention of the Constitution that each of the great co-ordinate departments of the government—the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judicial—shall be, in its sphere, independent of the others. To the executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon; and it is granted without limit. Pardon includes amnesty. It blots out the offence pardoned and removes all its penal consequences. It may be granted on conditions. In these particular pardons, that no doubt might exist as to their character, restoration of property was expressly pledged, and the pardon was granted on condition that the person who availed himself of it should take and keep a prescribed oath.</p>

<p id="fb739489-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There have been many occasions in which Congress has reacted to a Supreme Court decision interpreting a statute by adopting a law effectively overruling the Court’s ruling. In essence, Congress is directing the results in future cases. The key question is whether this is distinguishable from <i>Klein</i>. The Supreme Court distinguished <i>Klein</i> in the following more recent cases.</p>

Additionally, the act expressly noted two pending cases and said that “Congress hereby determines and directs that management of areas according to subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section on [the specified lands] is adequate consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the basis for [the two lawsuits].”</p>
<p id="fb73948c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court rejected the argument that Congress was directing the outcome of the pending litigation. The Supreme Court held that Congress had changed the law itself and did not direct findings or results under the old law. The Court said that <i>Klein</i> applies in a situation where Congress directs the judiciary as to decision making under an existing law and does not apply when Congress adopts a new law. The Court found that as a new law the statute was constitutional.</p>

Ct. 1310 (2016): American nationals may seek money damages from state sponsors of terrorism in the courts of the United States. Prevailing plaintiffs, however, often face practical and legal difficulties enforcing their judgments. To place beyond dispute the availability of certain assets for satisfaction of judgments rendered in terrorism cases against Iran, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of <span title="39" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-39">p. 39</span>2012. The Act makes a designated set of assets available to satisfy the judgments in a specific case, designated by docket number.</p>
<p id="fb73948f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs—more than 1,000 victims of Iran-sponsored acts of terrorism, their estate representatives, and surviving family members—brought suit against Iran. They obtained default judgments and moved for the turnover of about $1.75 billion in bond assets held in a New York bank account—assets that they alleged were owned by Bank Markazi, the Central Bank of Iran. The Bank argued that the federal statute violated separation of powers because it usurped the judicial role by directing a particular result in the pending enforcement proceeding.</p>
<p id="fb739490-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg, writing for the Court in a 6-2 decision, held that the statute does not violate separation of powers. The Court explained that Article III bars Congress from telling a court how to apply preexisting law to particular circumstances. But Congress may amend a law and make the amended prescription retroactively applicable in pending cases. The statute does just that: It requires a court to apply a new legal standard in a pending postjudgment enforcement proceeding. It does not matter that it meant that the result in the case was a “foregone conclusion.” A statute does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts. Nor is the statute invalid because it prescribes a rule for a single, pending case identified by caption and docket number (and actually it was 16 cases).</p>
<p id="fb739491-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented. They said that the law violates the separation of powers. “No less than if it had passed a law saying ‘respondents win,’ Congress has decided this case by enacting a bespoke statute tailored to this case that resolves the parties’ specific legal disputes to guarantee respondents victory.”</p>
<p id="fb73bba2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases establish no clear principles as to what the phrase “exceptions and regulations” means or when separation of powers prevents Congress from changing the law in response to a Supreme Court decision interpreting a statute. Ultimately, the arguments about Congress’s ability to check the federal judiciary, like so many areas of constitutional law, turn on disputes about the meaning of the Constitution’s language, the intent of its framers, and the competing policy considerations.</p>

<p id="fb73bba5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article III, §2 authorizes federal courts to hear several types of “cases” and “controversies.” The Supreme Court has interpreted these words as giving rise to a series of limits on the federal judicial power. These limits are frequently referred to as justiciability doctrines. The justiciability doctrines are all judicially created limits on the matters that can be heard in federal courts. The Supreme Court has declared that some of these are “constitutional,” meaning that Congress by statute cannot override them. The Court also has said that some of the doctrines are “prudential,” meaning that they are based on prudent judicial administration and can be overridden by Congress since they are not constitutional requirements.</p>
<p id="fb73bba6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the justiciability doctrines raise basic policy questions about the proper role of the federal judiciary in a democratic society. As Chief Justice Warren explained, the “words [cases and controversies] define the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assure that the federal courts will <span title="40" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-40">p. 40</span>not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10794_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10794_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> The justiciability doctrines also are intended to improve judicial decision making by providing the federal courts with concrete controversies best suited for judicial resolution. The Supreme Court explained that the requirement for cases and controversies “limit[s] the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1079A_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1079A_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">20</a></span> Moreover, the justiciability doctrines, by limiting the availability of federal court review, conserve judicial resources.</p>
<p id="fb73bba9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are five major justiciability doctrines: the prohibition against advisory opinions, standing, ripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine.

<p id="fb73e2bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the justiciability doctrines, the Supreme Court has said that it would follow certain “principles of avoidance” to ensure that it will reach constitutional questions only when necessary. The most famous articulation of these “avoidance principles” was by Justice Louis Brandeis in a concurring opinion in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107B4_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N107B4_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> Justice Brandeis wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb73e2bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considerations of propriety, as well as long-established practice, demand that we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it. The Court developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:</p>

<p id="fb73e2be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, nonadversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions “is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a nece\ssity in the determination of real, earnest, and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.”</p>
<p id="fb73e2bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The Court will not “anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.” “It is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.”</p>
<p id="fb73e2c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. The Court will not “formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.”</p>
<p id="fb73e2c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court <span title="41" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-41">p. 41</span>will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.</p>
<p id="fb73e2c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">5. The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right of challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. Thus, the challenge by a public official interested only in the performance of his official duty will not be entertained.</p>
<p id="fb73e2c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">6. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.</p>
<p id="fb73e2c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">7. “When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.”</p>
</div>

<p id="fb7409d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of these requirements overlap with the justiciability doctrines discussed below. Some are additional principles of restraint. As you examine the five justiciability doctrines—prohibition of advisory opinions, standing, ripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine—consider the extent to which they embody Brandeis’s principles of judicial restraint in constitutional cases.</p>

Fallon et al., <i>Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System</i> 92-93 (4th ed. 1996): Early in American history, a conflict occurred between France and England. The United States adopted a position of neutrality. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson asked the Supreme Court for its answers to a long list of questions concerning America’s conduct as a neutral party. In his letter to the Justices, Jefferson said that “[t]he President therefore would be much relieved if he found himself free to refer questions of this description to the opinions of the judges of the [Court], whose knowledge of the subject would secure us against errors dangerous to the peace of the United States.” For example, Jefferson asked the Justices, “May we, within our own ports, sell ships to both parties, prepared merely for merchandise? May they be pierced for guns?”</p>
<p id="fb7409db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Justices wrote back to President Washington and declined to answer the questions asked. The Justices, in their letter, stated: “[The] three departments of the government . . . being in certain respects checks upon each other, and our being judges of a court in the last resort, are considerations which afford strong arguments against the propriety of our extra-judicially deciding the questions alluded to.” The Justices concluded their letter: “We exceedingly regret every event that may cause embarrassment to your administration, but we derive consolation from the reflection that your judgment will discern what is right, and that your usual prudence, decision, and firmness will surmount every obstacle to the preservation of the rights, peace, and dignity of the United States.”</p>

<p id="fb7430f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In 1991, the Court ruled that actions brought under the securities laws, specifically §10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5), had to be brought within one year of discovering the facts giving rise to the violation and three years of the violation. Congress then amended the law to allow cases that were filed before this decision to go forward if they could have been brought under the prior law. The effect of the statute was to reopen actions that had been dismissed under the Court’s prior ruling.]</p>
<p id="fb7430f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb7430f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decisions to date have identified two types of legislation that require federal courts to exercise the judicial power in a manner that Article III forbids. The first appears in United States v. Klein (187[1]), where we refused to give effect to a statute that was said “[to] prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it.” Whatever the precise scope of <i>Klein</i>, however, later decisions have made clear that its prohibition does not take hold when Congress “amend[s] applicable law.” Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc. (1992). Section 27A(b) indisputably does set out substantive legal standards for the Judiciary to apply, and in that sense changes the law (even if solely retroactively). The second type of unconstitutional restriction upon the exercise of judicial power identified by past cases is exemplified by Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), which stands for the principle that Congress cannot vest review of the decisions of Article III courts in officials of the Executive Branch. Yet under any application of §27A(b) only courts are involved; no officials of other departments sit in direct review of their decisions. Section 27A(b) therefore offends neither of these previously established prohibitions.</p>
<p id="fb7430f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="43" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-43">p. 43</span>We think, however, that §27A(b) offends a postulate of Article III just as deeply rooted in our law as those we have mentioned. Article III establishes a “judicial department” with the “province and duty . . . to say what the law is” in particular cases and controversies. Marbury v. Madison (1803). The record of history shows that the framers crafted this charter of the judicial department with an expressed understanding that it gives the Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to decide them, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article III hierarchy—with an understanding, in short, that “a judgment conclusively resolves the case” because “a ‘judicial Power’ is one to render dispositive judgments.” By retroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final judgments, Congress has violated this fundamental principle.</p>
<p id="fb74580a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 27A(b) effects a clear violation of the separation-of-powers principle we have just discussed. It is, of course, retroactive legislation, that is, legislation that prescribes what the law was at an earlier time, when the act whose effect is controlled by the legislation occurred—in this case, the filing of the initial Rule 10b-5 action in the District Court.</p>
<p id="fb74580b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, as petitioners contend, that Congress can always revise the judgments of Article III courts in one sense: When a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments still on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted, and must alter the outcome accordingly. But a distinction between judgments from which all appeals have been forgone or completed, and judgments that remain on appeal (or subject to being appealed), is implicit in what Article III creates: not a batch of unconnected courts, but a judicial department composed of “inferior Courts” and “one supreme Court.” Within that hierarchy, the decision of an inferior court is not (unless the time for appeal has expired) the final word of the department as a whole. It is the obligation of the last court in the hierarchy that rules on the case to give effect to Congress’s latest enactment, even when that has the effect of overturning the judgment of an inferior court, since each court, at every level, must “decide according to existing laws.” Having achieved finality, however, a judicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy, and Congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that very case was something other than what the courts said it was.</p>
<p id="fb74580c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, a general statute such as this one may reduce the perception that legislative interference with judicial judgments was prompted by individual favoritism; but it is legislative interference with judicial judgments nonetheless. Not favoritism, nor even corruption, but power is the object of the separation-of-powers prohibition. The prohibition is violated when an individual final judgment is legislatively rescinded for even the very best of reasons, such as the legislature’s genuine conviction (supported by all the law professors in the land) that the judgment was wrong; and it is violated 40 times over when 40 final judgments are legislatively dissolved.</p>
<p id="fb74580d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We know of no previous instance in which Congress has enacted retroactive legislation requiring an Article III court to set aside a final judgment, and for good reason. The Constitution’s separation of legislative and judicial powers denies it the authority to do so. Section 27A(b) is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires federal courts to reopen final judgments entered before its enactment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.<span title="44" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-44">p. 44</span></p>

<p id="fb745810-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of the other justiciability doctrines implement the prohibition against advisory opinions. For instance, the standing requirement for an injury, the need that a case be ripe, and that it not be moot, all seek to ensure that there is an actual dispute between adverse litigants. Similarly, the standing requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate that the defendant is the cause of the injury so that a favorable court decision will remedy the harm seeks to ensure that a federal court ruling will make a difference.</p>
<p id="fb745811-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Earlier in this century, courts expressed concern over whether requests for declaratory judgments were advisory opinions. Initially, the Supreme Court expressed doubts about whether suits for declaratory judgments could be justiciable. <i>See</i> Piedmont &amp; Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 280 U.S. 469 (1930); Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Assn., 277 U.S. 274 (1928). Subsequently, the Supreme Court said that suits for declaratory judgments are justiciable as long as they meet the requirements for judicial review.</p>

WALLACE, 288 U.S. 249 (1933): A company sought a declaratory judgment that a tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court explained that because the matter would have been justiciable as a request for an injunction, the suit for a declaratory judgment was capable of federal court adjudication. Justice Stone, writing for the majority, explained, “The Constitution does not require that the case or controversy should be presented by traditional forms of procedure, invoking only traditional remedies. [Article III] did not crystallize into changeless form the procedure of 1789 as the only possible means for presenting a case or controversy.” The Court emphasized that the focus was on “substance” and “not with form” and that the case was justiciable “so long as the case retains the essentials of an adversary proceeding, involving a real, not a hypothetical, controversy.”</p>

<p id="fb747f26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Standing is the second major justiciability requirement. Indeed, the Supreme Court has declared that standing is the most important justiciability requirement. Standing is the determination of whether a specific person is the proper party to bring a matter to the court for adjudication. The Supreme Court has declared: “In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975).</p>
<p id="fb747f27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are several requirements that must be met in order for a plaintiff to have standing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1089C_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1089C_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> Although all are judicially created, the Court has said that some are based on its interpretation of Article III, and thus constitutionally required, while others are prudential. There are three constitutional standing requirements. First, the plaintiff must allege that he or she has suffered or imminently will suffer an injury. Second, the plaintiff must allege that the injury is fairly <span title="45" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-45">p. 45</span>traceable to the defendant’s conduct. Third, the plaintiff must allege that a favorable federal court decision is likely to redress the injury. In addition to these constitutional requirements, the Court also has identified two major prudential standing principles. Unlike constitutional barriers, Congress may override prudential limits by statute. First, a party generally may assert only his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of third parties not before the court. Second, a plaintiff may not sue as a taxpayer who shares a grievance in common with all other taxpayers.</p>

Environmental Protection Agency, are major rulings concerning the meaning of the three constitutional standing requirements: injury, causation, and redressability. In reading these cases, consider what types of injuries are sufficient for standing? What must a plaintiff allege and prove in order to meet the causation and redressability requirements? Underlying these cases is the question of whether the standing doctrine is appropriately applied to properly limit the role of the federal judiciary or whether the Court has unduly prevented the federal courts from fulfilling their responsibility of enforcing the Constitution and federal laws.</p>

<p id="fb74a642-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parents of black public school children allege in this nation-wide class action that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not adopted sufficient standards and procedures to fulfill its obligation to deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools. They assert that the IRS thereby harms them directly and interferes with the ability of their children to receive an education in desegregated public schools. The issue before us is whether plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit. We hold that they do not.</p>

<p id="fb74cd54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The IRS denies tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, and hence eligibility to receive charitable contributions deductible from income taxes to racially discriminatory private schools. The IRS policy requires that a school applying for tax-exempt status show that it “admits the students of any race to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at that school and that the school does not discriminate on the basis of race in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.” To carry out this policy, the IRS has established guidelines and procedures for determining whether a particular school is in fact racially nondiscriminatory. Failure to comply with the guidelines “will ordinarily result in the proposed revocation of ” tax-exempt status.</p>
<p id="fb74cd55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="46" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-46">p. 46</span>In 1976 respondents challenged these guidelines and procedures in a suit filed in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The plaintiffs named in the complaint are parents of black children who, at the time the complaint was filed, were attending public schools in seven States in school districts undergoing desegregation. They brought this nationwide class action “on behalf of themselves and their children, and . . . on behalf of all other parents of black children attending public school systems undergoing, or which may in the future undergo, desegregation pursuant to court order [or] HEW regulations and guidelines, under state law, or voluntarily.” They estimated that the class they seek to represent includes several million persons.</p>
<p id="fb74cd56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents allege in their complaint that many racially segregated private schools were created or expanded in their communities at the time the public schools were undergoing desegregation. According to the complaint, many such private schools, including 17 schools or school systems identified by name in the complaint (perhaps some 30 schools in all), receive tax exemptions either directly or through the tax-exempt status of “umbrella” organizations that operate or support the schools. Respondents allege that the challenged Government conduct harms them in two ways. The challenged conduct</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb74cd57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) constitutes tangible federal financial aid and other support for racially segregated educational institutions, and</p>
<p id="fb74cd58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) fosters and encourages the organization, operation and expansion of institutions providing racially segregated educational opportunities for white children avoiding attendance in desegregating public school districts and thereby interferes with the efforts of federal courts, HEW and local school authorities to desegregate public school districts which have been operating racially dual school systems.</p>
</div>

<p id="fb74cd59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, respondents do not allege that their children have been the victims of discriminatory exclusion from the schools whose tax exemptions they challenge as unlawful. Indeed, they have not alleged at any stage of this litigation that their children have ever applied or would ever apply to any private school. Rather, respondents claim a direct injury from the mere fact of the challenged Government conduct and, as indicated by the restriction of the plaintiff class to parents of children in desegregating school districts, injury to their children’s opportunity to receive a desegregated education. The latter injury is traceable to the IRS grant of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools, respondents allege, chiefly because contributions to such schools are deductible from income taxes under §§170(a)(1) and (c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and the “deductions facilitate the raising of funds to organize new schools and expand existing schools in order to accommodate white students avoiding attendance in desegregating public school districts.”</p>

<p id="fb74cd5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to adjudicating actual “cases” and “controversies.” As the Court explained in Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc. (1982), the “case or controversy” requirement defines with respect to the Judicial <span title="47" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-47">p. 47</span>Branch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded. The several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that requirement are “founded in concern about the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society.” Warth v. Seldin (1975). The case-or- controversy doctrines state fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our system of government.</p>
<p id="fb74cd5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Art. III doctrine that requires a litigant to have “standing” to invoke the power of a federal court is perhaps the most important of these doctrines. “In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.” Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff’s complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked. The requirement of standing, however, has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.</p>
<p id="fb74cd5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the prudential component, the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition. The injury alleged must be, for example, “‘distinct and palpable,’” and not “abstract” or “conjectural” or “hypothetical.” The injury must be “fairly” traceable to the challenged action, and relief from the injury must be “likely” to follow from a favorable decision. These terms cannot be defined so as to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.</p>
<p id="fb74f46f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More important, the law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of powers. It is this fact which makes possible the gradual clarification of the law through judicial application. Of course, both federal and state courts have long experience in applying and elaborating in numerous contexts the pervasive and fundamental notion of separation of powers.</p>
<p id="fb74f470-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Determining standing in a particular case may be facilitated by clarifying principles or even clear rules developed in prior cases. Typically, however, the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint’s allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted. Is the injury too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially cognizable? Is the line of causation between the illegal conduct and injury too attenuated? Is the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling too speculative? These questions and any others relevant to the standing inquiry must be answered by reference to the Art. III notion that federal courts may exercise power only “in the last resort, and as a necessity,” and only when adjudication is “consistent with a system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.”</p>

<p id="fb74f472-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents allege two injuries in their complaint to support their standing to bring this lawsuit. First, they say that they are harmed directly by the mere fact of Government financial aid to discriminatory private schools. Second, they say <span title="48" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-48">p. 48</span>that the federal tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools in their communities impair their ability to have their public schools desegregated.</p>
<p id="fb74f473-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that neither suffices to support respondents’ standing. The first fails under clear precedents of this Court because it does not constitute judicially cognizable injury. The second fails because the alleged injury is not fairly traceable to the assertedly unlawful conduct of the IRS.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1093A_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1093A_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span></p>
<p id="fb74f475-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ first claim of injury can be interpreted in two ways. It might be a claim simply to have the Government avoid the violation of law alleged in respondents’ complaint. Alternatively, it might be a claim of stigmatic injury, or denigration, suffered by all members of a racial group when the Government discriminates on the basis of race. Under neither interpretation is this claim of injury judicially cognizable.</p>
<p id="fb74f476-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has repeatedly held that an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court. In Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War (1974), for example, the Court rejected a claim of citizen standing to challenge Armed Forces Reserve commissions held by Members of Congress as violating the Incompatibility Clause of Art. I, §6, of the Constitution. As citizens, the Court held, plaintiffs alleged nothing but “the abstract injury in nonobservance of the Constitution. . . .” “[A]ssertion of a right to a particular kind of Government conduct, which the Government has violated by acting differently, cannot alone satisfy the requirements of Art. III without draining those requirements of meaning.” Respondents here have no standing to complain simply that their Government is violating the law.</p>
<p id="fb74f477-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither do they have standing to litigate their claims based on the stigmatizing injury often caused by racial discrimination. There can be no doubt that this sort of noneconomic injury is one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory government action and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing. Our cases make clear, however, that such injury accords a basis for standing only to “those persons who are personally denied equal treatment” by the challenged discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p id="fb74f478-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The consequences of recognizing respondents’ standing on the basis of their first claim of injury illustrate why our cases plainly hold that such injury is not judicially cognizable. If the abstract stigmatic injury were cognizable, standing would extend nationwide to all members of the particular racial groups against which the Government was alleged to be discriminating by its grant of a tax exemption to a racially discriminatory school, regardless of the location of that school. All such persons could claim the same sort of abstract stigmatic injury respondents assert in their first claim of injury. A black person in Hawaii could challenge the grant of a tax exemption to a racially discriminatory school in <span title="49" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-49">p. 49</span>Maine. Recognition of standing in such circumstances would transform the federal courts into “no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.” United States v. SCRAP (1973). Constitutional limits on the role of the federal courts preclude such a transformation.</p>
<p id="fb751b89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is in their complaint’s second claim of injury that respondents allege harm to a concrete, personal interest that can support standing in some circumstances. The injury they identify—their children’s diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school—is, beyond any doubt, not only judicially cognizable but, one of the most serious injuries recognized in our legal system. Despite the constitutional importance of curing the injury alleged by respondents, however, the federal judiciary may not redress it unless standing requirements are met. In this case, respondents’ second claim of injury cannot support standing because the injury alleged is not fairly traceable to the Government conduct respondents challenge as unlawful.</p>
<p id="fb751b8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The illegal conduct challenged by respondents is the IRS’s grant of tax exemptions to some racially discriminatory schools. The line of causation between that conduct and desegregation of respondents’ schools is attenuated at best. From the perspective of the IRS, the injury to respondents is highly indirect and “results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”</p>
<p id="fb751b8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The diminished ability of respondents’ children to receive a desegregated education would be fairly traceable to unlawful IRS grants of tax exemptions only if there were enough racially discriminatory private schools receiving tax exemptions in respondents’ communities for withdrawal of those exemptions to make an appreciable difference in public school integration. Respondents have made no such allegation. It is, first, uncertain how many racially discriminatory private schools are in fact receiving tax exemptions. Moreover, it is entirely speculative, as respondents themselves conceded in the Court of Appeals, whether withdrawal of a tax exemption from any particular school would lead the school to change its policies. It is just as speculative whether any given parent of a child attending such a private school would decide to transfer the child to public school as a result of any changes in educational or financial policy made by the private school once it was threatened with loss of tax-exempt status. It is also pure speculation whether, in a particular community, a large enough number of the numerous relevant school officials and parents would reach decisions that collectively would have a significant impact on the racial composition of the public schools.</p>
<p id="fb751b8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The links in the chain of causation between the challenged Government conduct and the asserted injury are far too weak for the chain as a whole to sustain respondents’ standing. In Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., the Court held that standing to challenge a Government grant of a tax exemption to hospitals could not be founded on the asserted connection between the grant of tax-exempt status and the hospitals’ policy concerning the provision of medical services to indigents. The causal connection depended on the decisions hospitals would make in response to withdrawal of tax-exempt status, and those decisions were sufficiently uncertain to break the chain of causation between the plaintiffs’ injury and the challenged Government action. The chain of causation is even weaker in this case. It involves numerous third parties (officials of racially discriminatory schools receiving tax exemptions and the parents of children attending such schools) who may not even exist in respondents’ communities <span title="50" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-50">p. 50</span>and whose independent decisions may not collectively have a significant effect on the ability of public school students to receive a desegregated education.</p>
<p id="fb751b8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The idea of separation of powers that underlies standing doctrine explains why our cases preclude the conclusion that respondents’ alleged injury “fairly can be traced to the challenged action” of the IRS. That conclusion would pave the way generally for suits challenging, not specifically identifiable Government violations of law, but the particular programs agencies establish to carry out their legal obligations. Such suits, even when premised on allegations of several instances of violations of law, are rarely if ever appropriate for federal-court adjudication.</p>
<p id="fb751b8e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When transported into the Art. III context, that principle, grounded as it is in the idea of separation of powers, counsels against recognizing standing in a case brought, not to enforce specific legal obligations whose violation works a direct harm, but to seek a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties. The Constitution, after all, assigns to the Executive Branch, and not to the Judicial Branch, the duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const., Art. II, §3. We could not recognize respondents’ standing in this case without running afoul of that structural principle.</p>

This kind of injury may be actionable whether it is caused by the exclusion of black children from public schools or by an official policy of encouraging white children to attend nonpublic schools.

The critical question in these cases, therefore, is whether respondents have alleged that the Government has created that kind of subsidy.</p>
<p id="fb7541a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering that question, we must of course assume that respondents can prove what they have alleged. Furthermore, at this stage of the litigation we must put to one side all questions about the appropriateness of a nationwide class action. The controlling issue is whether the causal connection between the injury and the wrong has been adequately alleged.</p>
<p id="fb7541a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="51" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-51">p. 51</span>We have held that when a subsidy makes a given activity more or less expensive, injury can be fairly traced to the subsidy for purposes of standing analysis because of the resulting increase or decrease in the ability to engage in the activity. Indeed, we have employed exactly this causation analysis in the same context at issue here—subsidies given private schools that practice racial discrimination.</p>
<p id="fb7541a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This causation analysis is nothing more than a restatement of elementary economics: when something becomes more expensive, less of it will be purchased. Sections 170 and 501(c)(3) are premised on that recognition. If racially discriminatory private schools lose the “cash grants” that flow from the operation of the statutes, the education they provide will become more expensive and hence less of their services will be purchased. Conversely, maintenance of these tax benefits makes an education in segregated private schools relatively more attractive, by decreasing its cost. Accordingly, without tax-exempt status, private schools will either not be competitive in terms of cost, or have to change their admissions policies, hence reducing their competitiveness for parents seeking “a racially segregated alternative” to public schools, which is what respondents have alleged many white parents in desegregating school districts seek.</p>

<p id="fb7541a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considerations of tax policy, economics, and pure logic all confirm the conclusion that respondents’ injury in fact is fairly traceable to the Government’s allegedly wrongful conduct. The Court therefore is forced to introduce the concept of “separation of powers” into its analysis. The Court writes that the separation of powers “explains why our cases preclude the conclusion” that respondents’ injury is fairly traceable to the conduct they challenge.</p>
<p id="fb7541aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court could mean one of three things by its invocation of the separation of powers. First, it could simply be expressing the idea that if the plaintiff lacks Art. III standing to bring a lawsuit, then there is no “case or controversy” within the meaning of Art. III and hence the matter is not within the area of responsibility assigned to the Judiciary by the Constitution. While there can be no quarrel with this proposition, in itself it provides no guidance for determining if the injury respondents have alleged is fairly traceable to the conduct they have challenged.</p>
<p id="fb7541ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court could be saying that it will require a more direct causal connection when it is troubled by the separation of powers implications of the case before it. That approach confuses the standing doctrine with the justiciability of the issues that respondents seek to raise. The purpose of the standing inquiry is to measure the plaintiff’s stake in the outcome, not whether a court has the authority to provide it with the outcome it seeks.</p>
<p id="fb7541ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court could be saying that it will not treat as legally cognizable injuries that stem from an administrative decision concerning how enforcement resources will be allocated. This surely is an important point. Respondents do seek to restructure the IRS’s mechanisms for enforcing the legal requirement that discriminatory institutions not receive tax-exempt status. Such restructuring would dramatically affect the way in which the IRS exercises its prosecutorial discretion. The Executive requires latitude to decide how best to enforce the law, and in general the Court may well be correct that the exercise of that discretion, especially in the tax context, is unchallengeable.</p>
<p id="fb7568bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-52">p. 52</span>However, as the Court also recognizes, this principle does not apply when suit is brought “to enforce specific legal obligations whose violation works a direct harm.” For example, despite the fact that they were challenging the methods used by the Executive to enforce the law, citizens were accorded standing to challenge a pattern of police misconduct that violated the constitutional constraints on law enforcement activities in Allee v. Medrano (1974). Here, respondents contend that the IRS is violating a specific constitutional limitation on its enforcement discretion. There is a solid basis for that contention.</p>

<p id="fb7568c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related. For when carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling of a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and retarding the escape of reflected heat. It is therefore a -species—the most important species—of a “greenhouse gas.”</p>
<p id="fb7568c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Calling global warming “the most pressing environmental challenge of our time,” a group of States, local governments, and private organizations, alleged in a petition for certiorari that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has abdicated its responsibility under the Clean Air Act to regulate the emissions of four greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. Specifically, petitioners asked us to answer two questions concerning the meaning of §202(a)(1) of the Act: whether EPA has the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles; and if so, whether its stated reasons for refusing to do so are consistent with the statute.</p>
<p id="fb758fd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, EPA, supported by 10 intervening States and six trade associations, correctly argued that we may not address those two questions unless at least one petitioner has standing to invoke our jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb758fd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to “Cases” and “Controversies.” Those two words confine “the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.” The parties’ dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute, a question eminently suitable to resolution in federal court. Congress has moreover authorized this type of challenge to EPA action. See 42 U.S.C. §7607(b)(1). That authorization is of critical importance to the standing inquiry: “Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.” “In exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.” We will not, therefore, “entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public’s nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fb758fd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions inflict widespread harm, the doctrine of standing presents an insuperable jurisdictional obstacle. We do not agree. At bottom, “the gist of the question of standing” is whether <span title="53" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-53">p. 53</span>petitioners have “such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.” Baker v. Carr (1962).</p>
<p id="fb758fd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992) holds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury. However, a litigant to whom Congress has “accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,”—here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, §7607(b)(1)—“can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.” When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.</p>
<p id="fb758fda-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review. We stress here, the special position and interest of Massachusetts. It is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not, as it was in <i>Lujan</i>, a private individual.</p>
<p id="fb758fdb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Well before the creation of the modern administrative state, we recognized that States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction. That Massachusetts does in fact own a great deal of the “territory alleged to be affected” only reinforces the conclusion that its stake in the outcome of this case is sufficiently concrete to warrant the exercise of federal judicial power.</p>
<p id="fb758fdc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives. Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India, and in some circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-empted.</p>
<p id="fb758fdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These sovereign prerogatives are now lodged in the Federal Government, and Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing standards applicable to the “emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator’s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” Congress has moreover recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious. Given that procedural right and Massachusetts’ stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.</p>
<p id="fb758fde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With that in mind, it is clear that petitioners’ submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the adversarial process. EPA’s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both “actual” and “imminent.” There is, moreover, a “substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested” will prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk.</p>

<p id="fb75b6f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized. Indeed, the NRC Report itself—which EPA regards as an “objective and <span title="54" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-54">p. 54</span>independent assessment of the relevant science[],”—identifies a number of environmental changes that have already inflicted significant harms, including “the global retreat of mountain glaciers, reduction in snow-cover extent, the earlier spring melting of rivers and lakes, [and] the accelerated rate of rise of sea levels during the 20th century relative to the past few thousand years. . . .”</p>
<p id="fb75b6f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners allege that this only hints at the environmental damage yet to come. According to the climate scientist Michael MacCracken, “qualified scientific experts involved in climate change research” have reached a “strong consensus” that global warming threatens (among other things) a precipitate rise in sea levels by the end of the century, “severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems,” a “significant reduction in water storage in winter snowpack in mountainous regions with direct and important economic consequences,” and an increase in the spread of disease. He also observes that rising ocean temperatures may contribute to the ferocity of hurricanes.</p>
<p id="fb75b6f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That these climate-change risks are “widely shared” does not minimize Massachusetts’ interest in the outcome of this litigation. The severity of that injury will only increase over the course of the next century: If sea levels continue to rise as predicted, one Massachusetts official believes that a significant fraction of coastal property will be “either permanently lost through inundation or temporarily lost through periodic storm surge and flooding events.” Remediation costs alone, petitioners allege, could run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p id="fb75b6f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">EPA does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. At a minimum, therefore, EPA’s refusal to regulate such emissions “contributes” to Massachusetts’ injuries.</p>
<p id="fb75b6f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">EPA nevertheless maintains that its decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles contributes so insignificantly to petitioners’ injuries that the agency cannot be haled into federal court to answer for them. For the same reason, EPA does not believe that any realistic possibility exists that the relief petitioners seek would mitigate global climate change and remedy their injuries. That is especially so because predicted increases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing nations, particularly China and India, are likely to offset any marginal domestic decrease.</p>
<p id="fb75b6f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But EPA overstates its case. Its argument rests on the erroneous assumption that a small incremental step, because it is incremental, can never be attacked in a federal judicial forum. Yet accepting that premise would doom most challenges to regulatory action. Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell regulatory swoop. They instead whittle away at them over time, refining their preferred approach as circumstances change and as they develop a more-nuanced understanding of how best to proceed. That a first step might be tentative does not by itself support the notion that federal courts lack jurisdiction to determine whether that step conforms to law.</p>
<p id="fb75b6f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly a tentative step. Even leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the United States transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere—according to the MacCracken affidavit, more than 1.7 billion metric tons in 1999 alone. That accounts for more than 6% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. <span title="55" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-55">p. 55</span>To put this in perspective: Considering just emissions from the transportation sector, which represent less than one-third of this country’s total carbon dioxide emissions, the United States would still rank as the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, outpaced only by the European Union and China. Judged by any standard, U.S. motor-vehicle emissions make a meaningful contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations and hence, according to petitioners, to global warming.</p>

<p id="fb75de09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle emissions will not by itself reverse global warming, it by no means follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it. Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with man-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant. Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.</p>

<p id="fb75de10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before determining whether petitioners can meet this familiar test, however, the Court changes the rules. It asserts that “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,” and that given “Massachusetts’ stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.”</p>
<p id="fb75de11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relaxing Article III standing requirements because asserted injuries are pressed by a State, however, has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for any such “special solicitude” is conspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.</p>

<p id="fb760523-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not at all clear how the Court’s “special solicitude” for Massachusetts plays out in the standing analysis, except as an implicit concession that petitioners cannot establish standing on traditional terms. But the status of Massachusetts as a State cannot compensate for petitioners’ failure to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability.</p>
<p id="fb760524-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Court actually applies the three-part test, it focuses on the State’s asserted loss of coastal land as the injury in fact. If petitioners rely on loss of land as the Article III injury, however, they must ground the rest of the standing analysis in that specific injury. That alleged injury must be “concrete and particularized,” and “distinct and palpable.” Central to this concept of “particularized” injury is the requirement that a plaintiff be affected in a “personal and individual way,” and seek relief that “directly and tangibly benefits him” in a manner distinct from its impact on “the public at large.”</p>
<p id="fb760525-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The very concept of global warming seems inconsistent with this particularization requirement. Global warming is a phenomenon “harmful to humanity at large,” and the redress petitioners seek is focused no more on them than on the public generally—it is literally to change the atmosphere around the world.</p>
<p id="fb760526-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If petitioners’ particularized injury is loss of coastal land, it is also that injury that must be “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” “real and immediate,” and “certainly impending.”</p>
<p id="fb760527-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to “actual” injury, the Court observes that “global sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming” and that “[t]hese rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts’ coastal land.” But none of petitioners’ declarations supports that connection. [A]side from a single conclusory statement, there is nothing in petitioners’ 43 standing declarations and accompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss of Massachusetts coastal land from 20th century global sea level increases. It is pure conjecture.</p>
<p id="fb760528-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s attempts to identify “imminent” or “certainly impending” loss of Massachusetts coastal land fares no better. [A]ccepting a century-long time horizon and a series of compounded estimates renders requirements of imminence and immediacy utterly toothless. “Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.”</p>

<p id="fb76052a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners’ reliance on Massachusetts’s loss of coastal land as their injury in fact for standing purposes creates insurmountable problems for them with respect to causation and redressability. To establish standing, petitioners must show a causal connection between that specific injury and the lack of new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that the promulgation of such standards would likely redress that injury. As is often the case, the questions of causation and redressability overlap. And importantly, when a party is challenging the Government’s allegedly unlawful regulation, or lack of regulation, of a third party, satisfying the causation and redressability requirements becomes “substantially more difficult.”</p>
<p id="fb76052b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners view the relationship between their injuries and EPA’s failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards as simple and direct: Domestic motor vehicles emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore also to petitioners’ alleged injuries. Without the new vehicle standards, greenhouse gas emissions—and therefore global warming and its attendant harms—have been higher than they otherwise would have been; once EPA changes course, the trend will be reversed.</p>
<p id="fb76052c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court ignores the complexities of global warming, and does so by now disregarding the “particularized” injury it relied on in step one, and using the dire nature of global warming itself as a bootstrap for finding causation and redressability. First, it is important to recognize the extent of the emissions at issue here. Because local greenhouse gas emissions disperse throughout the atmosphere and remain there for anywhere from 50 to 200 years, it is global emissions data that are relevant. According to one of petitioners’ declarations, domestic motor vehicles contribute about 6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of global emissions at issue here is smaller still; §202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act covers only <i>new</i> motor vehicles and <i>new</i> motor vehicle engines, so petitioners’ desired emission standards might reduce only a fraction of 4 percent of global emissions.</p>
<p id="fb762c3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This gets us only to the relevant greenhouse gas emissions; linking them to global warming and ultimately to petitioners’ alleged injuries next requires consideration of further complexities.</p>
<p id="fb762c3e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners are never able to trace their alleged injuries back through this complex web to the fractional amount of global emissions that might have been limited with EPA standards. In light of the bit-part domestic new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions have played in what petitioners describe as a 150-year global phenomenon, and the myriad additional factors bearing on petitioners’ alleged injury—the loss of Massachusetts coastal land—the connection is far too speculative to establish causation.</p>

<p id="fb762c40-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Redressability is even more problematic. To the tenuous link between petitioners’ alleged injury and the indeterminate fractional domestic emissions at issue here, add the fact that petitioners cannot meaningfully predict what will come <span title="58" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-58">p. 58</span>of the 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions that originate outside the United States. As the Court acknowledges, “developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century,” so the domestic emissions at issue here may become an increasingly marginal portion of global emissions, and any decreases produced by petitioners’ desired standards are likely to be overwhelmed many times over by emissions increases elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p id="fb762c41-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s sleight-of-hand is in failing to link up the different elements of the three-part standing test. What must be likely to be redressed is the particular injury in fact. The injury the Court looks to is the asserted loss of land. The Court contends that regulating domestic motor vehicle emissions will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and therefore redress Massachusetts’s injury. But even if regulation does reduce emissions—to some indeterminate degree, given events elsewhere in the world—the Court never explains why that makes it likely that the injury in fact—the loss of land—will be redressed. School-children know that a kingdom might be lost “all for the want of a horseshoe nail,” but “likely” redressability is a different matter. The realities make it pure conjecture to suppose that EPA regulation of new automobile emissions will likely prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land.</p>
<p id="fb762c42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The good news is that the Court’s “special solicitude” for Massachusetts limits the future applicability of the diluted standing requirements applied in this case. The bad news is that the Court’s self-professed relaxation of these Article III requirements has caused us to transgress “the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society.”</p>

<p id="fb765356-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both of these cases, the Supreme Court emphasizes that injury is a core requirement of Article III in order for there to be a case or controversy. The cases discuss, at length, what types of injuries are sufficient to meet the standing requirement. The cases also are clear that it must be an injury that the plaintiff personally has suffered or imminently will suffer. In connection with this requirement, consider the following two cases, in which the Supreme Court rejected standing on the ground that the plaintiff failed to adequately demonstrate a personally suffered injury. In each, consider whether you agree with the Court’s conclusion that the injury requirement was not fulfilled.</p>

<p id="fb765358-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">CITY OF LOS ANGELES v. LYONS, 461 U.S. 95 (1983): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span> delivered the opinion of the court:</p>
<p id="fb765359-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adolph Lyons filed a complaint for damages, injunction, and declaratory relief against the City of Los Angeles and four of its police officers. The complaint alleged that on October 6, 1976, at 2 a.m., Lyons was stopped by the defendant officers for a traffic or vehicle code violation and that although Lyons offered no resistance or threat whatsoever, the officers, without provocation or justification, seized Lyons and applied a “chokehold” rendering him unconscious and causing damage to his larynx.</p>
<p id="fb76535a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="59" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-59">p. 59</span>Originally, Lyons’s complaint alleged that at least two deaths had occurred as a result of the application of chokeholds by the police. His first amended complaint alleged that 10 chokehold-related deaths had occurred. By May, 1982, there had been five more such deaths.</p>
<p id="fb76535b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lyons has failed to demonstrate a case or controversy with the City that would justify the equitable relief sought. Lyons’s standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers. Count V of the complaint alleged the traffic stop and choking incident five months before. That Lyons may have been illegally choked by the police on October 6, 1976, while presumably affording Lyons standing to claim damages against the individual officers and perhaps against the City, does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped for a traffic violation, or for any other offense, by an officer or officers who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness without any provocation or resistance on his part. The additional allegation in the complaint that the police in Los Angeles routinely apply chokeholds in situations where they are not threatened by the use of deadly force falls far short of the allegations that would be necessary to establish a case or controversy between these parties.</p>
<p id="fb76535c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to establish an actual controversy in this case, Lyons would have had not only to allege that he would have another encounter with the police but also to make the incredible assertion either, (1) that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter, whether for the purpose of arrest, issuing a citation or for questioning or, (2) that the City ordered or authorized police officers to act in such manner. Although Count V alleged that the City authorized the use of the control holds in situations where deadly force was not threatened, it did not indicate why Lyons might be realistically threatened by police officers who acted within the strictures of the City’s policy. If, for example, chokeholds were authorized to be used only to counter resistance to an arrest by a suspect, or to thwart an effort to escape, any future threat to Lyons from the City’s policy or from the conduct of police officers would be no more real than the possibility that he would again have an encounter with the police and that either he would illegally resist arrest or detention or the officers would disobey their instructions and again render him unconscious without any provocation.</p>
<p id="fb76535d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way, Lyons is no more entitled to an injunction than any other citizen of Los Angeles; and a federal court may not entertain a claim by any or all citizens who no more than assert that certain practices of law enforcement officers are unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fb767a6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that the City of Los Angeles authorizes its police officers to apply life-threatening chokeholds to citizens who pose no threat of violence, and that respondent, Adolph Lyons, was subjected to such a chokehold. The Court today holds that a federal court is without power to enjoin the enforcement of the City’s policy, no matter how flagrantly unconstitutional it may be. Since no one can show that he will be choked in the future, no one—not even a person who, like Lyons, has almost been choked to death—has standing <span title="60" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-60">p. 60</span>to challenge the continuation of the policy. The City is free to continue the policy indefinitely as long as it is willing to pay damages for the injuries and deaths that result. I dissent from this unprecedented and unwarranted approach to standing.</p>

<p id="fb767a71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE, 504 U.S. 555 (1992): Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="fb767a72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A challenge was brought to a rule promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior interpreting Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act concerning when the federal government could comply with the Endangered Species Act. Under the rule, the federal government would comply with the Act only for actions taken in the United States or on the high seas. Citizens brought a suit challenging the new regulation, having standing, in part, on a provision in the Act authorizing citizen standing.</p>
<p id="fb767a73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ claim to injury is that the lack of consultation with respect to certain funded activities abroad “increas[es] the rate of extinction of endangered and threatened species.” Of course, the desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing. “But the ‘injury in fact’ test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured.” To survive the Secretary’s summary judgment motion, respondents had to submit affidavits or other evidence showing, through specific facts, not only that listed species were in fact being threatened by funded activities abroad, but also that one or more of respondents’ members would thereby be “directly” affected apart from their “‘special interest’ in th[e] subject.” With respect to this aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals focused on the affidavits of two Defenders’ members—Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred. Ms. Kelly stated that she traveled to Egypt in 1986 and “observed the traditional habitat of the endangered [N]ile crocodile there and intend[s] to do so again, and hope[s] to observe the crocodile directly,” and that she “will suffer harm in fact as the result of [the] American . . . role . . . in overseeing the rehabilitation of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile . . . and [in] develop[ing] . . . Egypt’s . . . Master Water Plan.” Ms. Skilbred averred that she traveled to Sri Lanka in 1981 and “observed th[e] habitat” of “endangered species such as the Asian elephant and the leopard” at what is now the site of the Mahaweli project funded by the Agency for International Development (AID), although she “was unable to see any of the endangered species”; “this development project,” she continued, “will seriously reduce endangered, threatened, and endemic species habitat including areas that I visited . . . [, which] may severely shorten the future of these species”; that threat, she concluded, harmed her because she “intend[s] to return to Sri Lanka in the future and hope[s] to be more fortunate in spotting at least the endangered elephant and leopard.” When Ms. Skilbred was asked at a subsequent deposition if and when she had any plans to return to Sri Lanka, she reiterated that “I intend to go back to Sri Lanka,” but confessed that she had no current plans: “I don’t know [when]. There is a civil war going on right now. I don’t know. Not next year, I will say. In the future.”</p>
<p id="fb767a74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We shall assume for the sake of argument that these affidavits contain facts showing that certain agency-funded projects threaten listed species—though that is questionable. They plainly contain no facts, however, showing how damage to the species will produce “imminent” injury to Mses. Kelly and Skilbred. <span title="61" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-61">p. 61</span>That the women “had visited” the areas of the projects before the projects commenced proves nothing. As we have said in a related context, “‘Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.’” And the affiants’ profession of an “inten[t]” to return to the places they had visited before—where they will presumably, this time, be deprived of the opportunity to observe animals of the endangered species—is simply not enough. Such “some day” intentions—without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be—do not support a finding of the “actual or imminent” injury that our cases require.</p>
<p id="fb767a75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides relying upon the Kelly and Skilbred affidavits, respondents propose a series of novel standing theories. The first, inelegantly styled “ecosystem nexus,” proposes that any person who uses any part of a “contiguous ecosystem” adversely affected by a funded activity has standing even if the activity is located a great distance away. This approach is inconsistent with our opinion in <i>National Wildlife Federation</i>, which held that a plaintiff claiming injury from environmental damage must use the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly “in the vicinity” of it. It makes no difference that the general-purpose section of the ESA states that the Act was intended in part “to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved.” To say that the Act protects ecosystems is not to say that the Act creates (if it were possible) rights of action in persons who have not been injured in fact, that is, persons who use portions of an ecosystem not perceptibly affected by the unlawful action in question.</p>
<p id="fb767a76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ other theories are called, alas, the “animal nexus” approach, whereby anyone who has an interest in studying or seeing the endangered animals anywhere on the globe has standing; and the “vocational nexus” approach, under which anyone with a professional interest in such animals can sue. Under these theories, anyone who goes to see Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, and anyone who is a keeper of Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, has standing to sue because the Director of the Agency for International Development (AID) did not consult with the Secretary regarding the AID-funded project in Sri Lanka. This is beyond all reason. Standing is not “an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable,” but as we have said requires, at the summary judgment stage, a factual showing of perceptible harm. It is clear that the person who observes or works with a particular animal threatened by a federal decision is facing perceptible harm, since the very subject of his interest will no longer exist. It is even plausible—though it goes to the outermost limit of plausibility—to think that a person who observes or works with animals of a particular species in the very area of the world where that species is threatened by a federal decision is facing such harm, since some animals that might have been the subject of his interest will no longer exist. It goes beyond the limit, however, and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say that anyone who observes or works with an endangered species, anywhere in the world, is appreciably harmed by a single project affecting some portion of that species with which he has no more specific connection.</p>
<p id="fb767a77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides failing to show injury, respondents failed to demonstrate redressability. Instead of attacking the separate decisions to fund particular projects allegedly causing them harm, respondents chose to challenge a more generalized level of Government action (rules regarding consultation), the invalidation of which would affect all overseas projects. This programmatic approach <span title="62" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-62">p. 62</span>has obvious practical advantages, but also obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causation or redressability is concerned. As we have said in another context, “suits challenging, not specifically identifiable Government violations of law, but the particular programs agencies establish to carry out their legal obligations . . . [are], even when premised on allegations of several instances of violations of law, . . . rarely if ever appropriate for federal-court adjudication.” Allen v. Wright.</p>
<p id="fb767a78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most obvious problem in the present case is redressability. Since the agencies funding the projects were not parties to the case, the District Court could accord relief only against the Secretary: He could be ordered to revise his regulation to require consultation for foreign projects. But this would not remedy respondents’ alleged injury unless the funding agencies were bound by the Secretary’s regulation, which is very much an open question. Whereas in other contexts the ESA is quite explicit as to the Secretary’s controlling authority, <i>see, e.g.</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1533(a)(1) (“The Secretary shall” promulgate regulations determining endangered species); §1535(d)(1) (“The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to any State”), with respect to consultation the initiative, and hence arguably the initial responsibility for determining statutory necessity, lies with the agencies, <i>see</i> §1536(a)(2) (“Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any” funded action is not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species). When the Secretary promulgated the regulation at issue here, he thought it was binding on the agencies. The Solicitor General, however, has repudiated that position here, and the agencies themselves apparently deny the Secretary’s authority. The agencies were not parties to the suit, and there is no reason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal determination the suit produced.</p>
<p id="fb767a79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A further impediment to redressability is the fact that the agencies generally supply only a fraction of the funding for a foreign project. AID, for example, has provided less than 10% of the funding for the Mahaweli project. Respondents have produced nothing to indicate that the projects they have named will either be suspended, or do less harm to listed species, if that fraction is eliminated. It is entirely conjectural whether the nonagency activity that affects respondents will be altered or affected by the agency activity they seek to achieve. There is no standing.</p>
<p id="fb76a18a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb76a18b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were the Court to apply the proper standard for summary judgment, I believe it would conclude that the sworn affidavits and deposition testimony of Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred advance sufficient facts to create a genuine issue for trial concerning whether one or both would be imminently harmed by the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. In the first instance, as the Court itself concedes, the affidavits contained facts making it at least “questionable” (and therefore within the province of the factfinder) that certain agency-funded projects threaten listed species. The only remaining issue, then, is whether Kelly and Skilbred have shown that they personally would suffer imminent harm.</p>
<p id="fb76a18c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I think a reasonable finder of fact could conclude from the information in the affidavits and deposition testimony that either Kelly or Skilbred will soon return to the project sites, thereby satisfying the “actual or imminent” injury standard. The Court dismisses Kelly’s and Skilbred’s general statements that they intended to revisit the project sites as “simply not enough.” But those statements did not stand alone. A reasonable finder of fact could conclude, based <span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span>not only upon their statements of intent to return, but upon their past visits to the project sites, as well as their professional backgrounds, that it was likely that Kelly and Skilbred would make a return trip to the project areas. Contrary to the Court’s contention that Kelly’s and Skilbred’s past visits “prov[e] nothing,” the fact of their past visits could demonstrate to a reasonable factfinder that Kelly and Skilbred have the requisite resources and personal interest in the preservation of the species endangered by the Aswan and Mahaweli projects to make good on their intention to return again.</p>
<p id="fb76a18d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By requiring a “description of concrete plans” or “specification of when the some day [for a return visit] will be,” the Court, in my view, demands what is likely an empty formality. No substantial barriers prevent Kelly or Skilbred from simply purchasing plane tickets to return to the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. This case differs from other cases in which the imminence of harm turned largely on the affirmative actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff’s control. To be sure, a plaintiff’s unilateral control over his or her exposure to harm does not necessarily render the harm nonspeculative. Nevertheless, it suggests that a finder of fact would be far more likely to conclude the harm is actual or imminent, especially if given an opportunity to hear testimony and determine credibility.</p>
<p id="fb76a18e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I fear the Court’s demand for detailed descriptions of future conduct will do little to weed out those who are genuinely harmed from those who are not. More likely, it will resurrect a code-pleading formalism in federal court summary judgment practice, as federal courts, newly doubting their jurisdiction, will demand more and more particularized showings of future harm. Just to survive summary judgment, for example, a property owner claiming a decline in the value of his property from governmental action might have to specify the exact date he intends to sell his property and show that there is a market for the property, lest it be surmised he might not sell again. A nurse turned down for a job on grounds of her race had better be prepared to show on what date she was prepared to start work, that she had arranged daycare for her child, and that she would not have accepted work at another hospital instead. And a Federal Tort Claims Act plaintiff alleging loss of consortium should make sure to furnish this Court with a “description of concrete plans” for her nightly schedule of attempted activities.</p>
<p id="fb76a18f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conclusion, I cannot join the Court on what amounts to a slash-and-burn expedition through the law of environmental standing.

Although the cases express that causation and redressability are distinct constitutional requirements, they are obviously interrelated.</p>
<p id="fb76c8aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The causation/redressability standing requirement has been more controversial than the injury requirement. On the one hand, it can be argued that this requirement simply implements the prohibition against advisory opinions; if a federal court decision will have little effect, if it will not redress the injuries, then it is an advisory opinion. On the other hand, it can be argued that causation <span title="65" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-65">p. 65</span>and redressability are inappropriate determinations to make on the basis of the pleadings. All decisions about standing initially are made on the basis of the pleadings, assuming all allegations within them to be true. The criticism is that redressability is inherently a factual question—how likely it is that a favorable court decision will have a particular effect—that should not be made at the outset of a lawsuit. Traditionally, courts consider whether equitable relief will have the desired effect at the remedy stage, after there has been an opportunity for discovery and a hearing on the merits.</p>
<p id="fb76c8ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To appraise these competing views, and to understand the requirements, it is useful to consider the major cases, in addition to <i>Allen</i> and <i>Lujan</i>, where the Court has applied causation and redressability.</p>

<p id="fb77650a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two distinct standing questions are presented. First, whether the plaintiff-respondents allege “injury in fact,” that is, a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of their suit to make it a case or controversy subject to a federal court’s Art. III jurisdiction, and, second, whether, as a prudential matter, the <span title="68" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-68">p. 68</span>plaintiff-respondents are proper proponents of the particular legal rights on which they base their suit.</p>
<p id="fb77650b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A. The first of these questions needs little comment for there is no doubt now that the respondent-physicians suffer concrete injury from the operation of the challenged statute. Their complaint and affidavits allege that they have performed and will continue to perform operations for which they would be reimbursed under the Medicaid program, were it not for the limitation of reimbursable abortions to those that are “medically indicated.” If the physicians prevail in their suit to remove this limitation, they will benefit, for they will then receive payment for the abortions. The State (and Federal Government) will be out of pocket by the amount of the payments. The relationship between the parties is classically adverse, and there clearly exists between them a case or controversy in the constitutional sense.</p>
<p id="fb77650c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">B. The question of what rights the doctors may assert in seeking to resolve that controversy is more difficult. Federal courts must hesitate before resolving a controversy, even one within their constitutional power to resolve, on the basis of the rights of third persons not parties to the litigation. The reasons are two. First, the courts should not adjudicate such rights unnecessarily, and it may be that in fact the holders of those rights either do not wish to assert them, or will be able to enjoy them regardless of whether the in-court litigant is successful or not. Second, third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights. The courts depend on effective advocacy, and therefore should prefer to construe legal rights only when the most effective advocates of those rights are before them. The holders of the rights may have a like preference, to the extent they will be bound by the courts’ decisions under the doctrine of stare decisis. These two considerations underlie the Court’s general rule: “Ordinarily, one may not claim standing in this Court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party.”</p>
<p id="fb77650d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like any general rule, however, this one should not be applied where its underlying justifications are absent. With this in mind, the Court has looked primarily to two factual elements to determine whether the rule should apply in a particular case. The first is the relationship of the litigant to the person whose right he seeks to assert. If the enjoyment of the right is inextricably bound up with the activity the litigant wishes to pursue, the court at least can be sure that its construction of the right is not unnecessary in the sense that the right’s enjoyment will be unaffected by the outcome of the suit. Furthermore, the relationship between the litigant and the third party may be such that the former is fully, or very nearly, as effective a proponent of the right as the latter.</p>
<p id="fb77650e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other factual element to which the Court has looked is the ability of the third party to assert his own right. Even where the relationship is close, the reasons for requiring persons to assert their own rights will generally still apply. If there is some genuine obstacle to such assertion, however, the third party’s absence from court loses its tendency to suggest that his right is not truly at stake, or truly important to him, and the party who is in court becomes by default the right’s best available proponent.</p>
<p id="fb77650f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Application of these principles to the present case quickly yields its proper result. The closeness of the relationship is patent, as it was in <i>Griswold</i> and in <i>Doe</i>. A woman cannot safely secure an abortion without the aid of a physician, and an impecunious woman cannot easily secure an abortion without the physician’s being paid by the State. The woman’s exercise of her right to an abortion, <span title="69" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-69">p. 69</span>whatever its dimension, is therefore necessarily at stake here. Moreover, the constitutionally protected abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved. Aside from the woman herself, therefore, the physician is uniquely qualified to litigate the constitutionality of the State’s interference with, or discrimination against, that decision.</p>
<p id="fb778c20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the woman’s assertion of her own rights, there are several obstacles. For one thing, she may be chilled from such assertion by a desire to protect the very privacy of her decision from the publicity of a court suit. A second obstacle is the imminent mootness, at least in the technical sense, of any individual woman’s claim. Only a few months, at the most, after the maturing of the decision to undergo an abortion, her right thereto will have been irrevocably lost, assuming, as it seems fair to assume, that unless the impecunious woman can establish Medicaid eligibility she must forgo abortion. It is true that these obstacles are not insurmountable. Suit may be brought under a pseudonym, as so frequently has been done. A woman who is no longer pregnant may nonetheless retain the right to litigate the point because it is “‘capable of repetition yet evading review.’” And it may be that a class could be assembled, whose fluid membership always included some women with live claims. But if the assertion of the right is to be “representative” to such an extent anyway, there seems little loss in terms of effective advocacy from allowing its assertion by a physician.</p>
<p id="fb778c21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we conclude that it generally is appropriate to allow a physician to assert the rights of women patients as against governmental interference with the abortion decision.</p>
<p id="fb778c22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Singleton v. Wulff focuses on two factors in determining whether a plaintiff can sue on behalf of a third party: the closeness of the relationship between the plaintiff and the injured third party, and the likelihood that the third party can sue on its own behalf. Consider how these factors were applied in the following cases:</p>

<p id="fb778c24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BARROWS v. JACKSON, 346 U.S. 249 (1953): Barrows, a white person who had signed a racially restrictive covenant, was sued for breach of contract for allowing nonwhites to occupy the property. As a defense, Barrows raised the rights of blacks, who were not parties to the lawsuit, to be free from discrimination. The Court allowed third-party standing, permitting the white defendant to raise the interests of blacks to rent and own property in the community. The Court stated that “it would be difficult if not impossible for the persons whose rights are asserted to present their grievance before any court.” Because blacks were not parties to the covenant, they had no legal basis for participating in the breach of contract suit. (The suit occurred before open housing laws were enacted that would have allowed African Americans to challenge the covenants as impermissible discrimination.)</p>

UTAH, 429 U.S. 1012 (1976): Gary Gilmore was sentenced to death in the state of Utah but chose not to pursue habeas corpus relief in federal court. His mother sued for a stay of execution on his behalf. In a five-to-four decision, the Court refused to hear his mother’s claim. The Court’s <i>per curiam</i> opinion said that the defendant had waived his rights by not pursuing them.</p>
<p id="fb77b33a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Burger, in a concurring opinion, said that the mother should be denied standing: “When the record establishing a knowing and intelligent waiver of Gary Mark Gilmore’s right to seek appellate review is combined with the December 8 written response submitted to this Court, it is plain that the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the ‘next friend’ application filed by Bessie Gilmore. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Art. III of the Constitution only over ‘cases and controversies,’ and we can issue stays only in aid of our jurisdiction. There is no dispute, presently before us, between Gary Mark Gilmore and the State of Utah, and the application of Bessie Gilmore manifestly fails to meet the statutory requirements to invoke this Court’s power to review the action of the Supreme Court of Utah. No authority to the contrary has been brought to our attention, and nothing suggested in dissent bears on the threshold question of jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="fb77b33b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2004, the Court returned to the issue of third-party standing in a high-profile case concerning whether the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance are constitutional. The Court dismissed the case on standing grounds. In Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), the Court held that a father lacked standing to sue on behalf of his daughter because he lacked legal custody for the girl and the mother who had legal custody did not want to sue. Justice Stevens wrote, “In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiff’s claimed standing. When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law. There is a vast difference between Newdow’s right to communicate with his child—which both California law and the First Amendment recognize—and his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order. We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.” Yet why is Newdow’s ability to sue based on who has custody of the girl? Does he not have a claim that his own right to control the religious upbringing of his daughter is infringed by the requirement of “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?</p>

<p id="fb77da56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the respondent has standing to bring an action as a federal taxpayer alleging that certain provisions concerning public reporting of expenditures under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, violate Art. I, §9, cl. 7, of the Constitution which provides:</p>

<p id="fb77da58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Frothingham v. Mellon (1923), the plaintiff sought to enjoin enforcement of the Federal Maternity Act of 1921, which provided for financial grants to States with programs for reducing maternal and infant mortality. She alleged violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the ground that the legislation encroached on an area reserved to the States. In <i>Frothingham</i>, the injury alleged was that the congressional enactment challenged as unconstitutional would, if implemented, increase the complainant’s future federal income taxes. Denying standing, the <i>Frothingham</i> Court rested on the “comparatively minute[,] remote, fluctuating and uncertain,” impact on the taxpayer, and the failure to allege the kind of direct injury required for standing.</p>
<p id="fb77da59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Flast v. Cohen (1968), this Court explained: “The ‘gist of the question of standing’ is whether the party seeking relief has ‘alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness . . . upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” The Court then announced a two-pronged standing test which requires allegations: (a) challenging an enactment under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art. I, §8, of the Constitution; and (b) claiming that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed on the taxing and spending power. While the “impenetrable barrier to suits against Acts of Congress brought by individuals who can assert only the interest of federal taxpayers,” had been slightly lowered, the Court made clear it was reaffirming the principle of <i>Frothingham</i> precluding a taxpayer’s use of “a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System.”</p>
<p id="fb78016a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mere recital of the respondent’s claims and an examination of the statute under attack demonstrate how far he falls short of the standing criteria of <i>Flast</i> and how neatly he falls within the <i>Frothingham</i> holding left undisturbed. <span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-72">p. 72</span>Although the status he rests on is that he is a taxpayer, his challenge is not addressed to the taxing or spending power, but to the statutes regulating the CIA, specifically 50 U.S.C. §403j(b). That section provides different accounting and reporting requirements and procedures for the CIA, as is also done with respect to other governmental agencies dealing in confidential areas.</p>
<p id="fb78016b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent makes no claim that appropriated funds are being spent in violation of a “specific constitutional limitation upon the . . . taxing and spending power. . . .” Rather, he asks the courts to compel the Government to give him information on precisely how the CIA spends its funds. Thus there is no “logical nexus” between the asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of the Congress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed report of the expenditures of that agency. The question presented thus is simply and narrowly whether these claims meet the standards for taxpayer standing set forth in <i>Flast</i>; we hold they do not. Respondent is seeking “to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government.”</p>
<p id="fb78016c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent’s claim is that without detailed information on CIA expenditures—and hence its activities—he cannot intelligently follow the actions of Congress or the Executive, nor can he properly fulfill his obligations as a member of the electorate in voting for candidates seeking national office.</p>
<p id="fb78016d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is surely the kind of a generalized grievance described in both <i>Frothingham</i> and <i>Flast</i> since the impact on him is plainly undifferentiated and “common to all members of the public.” While we can hardly dispute that this respondent has a genuine interest in the use of funds and that his interest may be prompted by his status as a taxpayer, he has not alleged that, as a taxpayer, he is in danger of suffering any particular concrete injury as a result of the operation of this statute.</p>
<p id="fb78016e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ex parte Levitt is especially instructive. There Levitt sought to challenge the validity of the commission of a Supreme Court Justice who had been nominated and confirmed as such while he was a member of the Senate. Levitt alleged that the appointee had voted for an increase in the emoluments provided by Congress for Justices of the Supreme Court during the term for which he was last elected to the United States Senate. The claim was that the appointment violated the explicit prohibition of Art. I, §6, cl. 2, of the Constitution. The Court disposed of Levitt’s claim, stating: “‘It is an established principle that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that action and it is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.’”</p>
<p id="fb78016f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, if Levitt’s allegations were true, they made out an arguable violation of an explicit prohibition of the Constitution. Yet even this was held insufficient to support standing because, whatever Levitt’s injury, it was one he shared with “all members of the public.”</p>
<p id="fb780170-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It can be argued that if respondent is not permitted to litigate this issue, no one can do so. In a very real sense, the absence of any particular individual or class to litigate these claims gives support to the argument that the subject matter is committed to the surveillance of Congress, and ultimately to the political process. The Constitution created a representative Government with the representatives directly responsible to their constituents at stated periods of two, four, <span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-73">p. 73</span>and six years; that the Constitution does not afford a judicial remedy does not, of course, completely disable the citizen who is not satisfied with the “ground rules” established by the Congress for reporting expenditures of the Executive Branch. Lack of standing within the narrow confines of Art. III jurisdiction does not impair the right to assert his views in the political forum or at the polls. Slow, cumbersome, and unresponsive though the traditional electoral process may be thought at times, our system provides for changing members of the political branches when dissatisfied citizens convince a sufficient number of their fellow electors that elected representatives are delinquent in performing duties committed to them.</p>

<p id="fb780172-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decisions in Flast v. Cohen (1968), and Frothingham v. Mellon (1923), throw very little light on the question at issue in this case. For, unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, Richardson did not bring this action asking a court to invalidate a federal statute on the ground that it was beyond the delegated power of Congress to enact or that it contravened some constitutional prohibition. Richardson’s claim is of an entirely different order. It is that Art. I, §9, cl. 7, of the Constitution, the Statement and Account Clause, gives him a right to receive, and imposes on the Government a corresponding affirmative duty to supply, a periodic report of the receipts and expenditures “of all public Money.” In support of his standing to litigate this claim, he has asserted his status both as a taxpayer and as a citizen-voter. Whether the Statement and Account Clause imposes upon the Government an affirmative duty to supply the information requested and whether that duty runs to every taxpayer or citizen are questions that go to the substantive merits of this litigation. Those questions are not now before us, but I think that the Court is quite wrong in holding that the respondent was without standing to raise them in the trial court.</p>
<p id="fb782883-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seeking a determination that the Government owes him a duty to supply the information he has requested, the respondent is in the position of a traditional Hohfeldian plaintiff. He contends that the Statement and Account Clause gives him a right to receive the information and burdens the Government with a correlative duty to supply it. Courts of law exist for the resolution of such right-duty disputes. When a party is seeking a judicial determination that a defendant owes him an affirmative duty, it seems clear to me that he has standing to litigate the issue of the existence vel non of this duty once he shows that the defendant has declined to honor his claim. If the duty in question involved the payment of a sum of money, I suppose that all would agree that a plaintiff asserting the duty would have standing to litigate the issue of his entitlement to the money upon a showing that he had not been paid. I see no reason for a different result when the defendant is a Government official and the asserted duty relates not to the payment of money, but to the disclosure of items of information.</p>

<p id="fb782884-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a companion case, decided the same day, Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208 (1974), the Court also denied citizen and taxpayer standing. The plaintiffs sued to enjoin members of Congress from serving in the military reserves. Article 1, §6 of the Constitution prevents <span title="74" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-74">p. 74</span>a senator or representative from holding civil office. As in <i>Richardson</i>, standing was denied because the plaintiff alleged injury only as a citizen or taxpayer with an interest in having the government follow the law and not a violation of a specific constitutional right. The Court stated: “Respondents seek to have the Judicial Branch compel the Executive Branch to act in conformity with the Incompatibility Clause, an interest shared by all citizens. . . . Our system of government leaves many crucial decisions to the political processes. The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.”</p>
<p id="fb782885-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both <i>Richardson</i> and <i>Schlesinger</i>, the Court recognizes that denying taxpayer and citizen standing likely will mean that no one could bring a lawsuit challenging the allegedly unconstitutional conduct. The crucial issue, then, is whether it is desirable that some constitutional provisions be left entirely to the political branches for their interpretation and enforcement. On the one hand, the Court’s majority argues that the absence of judicial review confirms that these are matters best left to the political process. On the other hand, critics argue that it is essential that the judiciary be available to enforce all of the Constitution or it can be effectively rendered a nullity. The same issue, with the same competing views, arises below in connection with the political question doctrine.</p>
<p id="fb782886-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has recognized only one exception where taxpayer standing is permitted: to challenge government expenditures as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the provision that prohibits Congress from making any law respecting the establishment of religion.

<p id="fb784f9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Frothingham v. Mellon (1923), this Court ruled that a federal taxpayer is without standing to challenge the constitutionality of a federal statute. That ruling has stood for 45 years as an impenetrable barrier to suits against Acts of Congress brought by individuals who can assert only the interest of federal taxpayers. In this case, we must decide whether the <i>Frothingham</i> barrier should be lowered when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb784f9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of federal funds under Titles I and II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The complaint alleged that the seven appellants had as a common attribute that “each pay[s] income taxes of the United States,” and it is clear from the complaint that the appellants were resting their standing to maintain the action solely on their status as federal taxpayers. The gravamen of the appellants’ complaint was that federal funds appropriated under the Act were being used to finance instruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in religious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other instructional materials for use in such schools. Such expenditures were alleged to be in contravention of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fb784f9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="75" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-75">p. 75</span>The question of standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution. It is for that reason that the emphasis in standing problems is on whether the party invoking federal court jurisdiction has “a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,” and whether the dispute touches upon “the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.” A taxpayer may or may not have the requisite personal stake in the outcome, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. Therefore, we find no absolute bar in Article III to suits by federal taxpayers challenging allegedly unconstitutional federal taxing and spending programs. There remains, however, the problem of determining the circumstances under which a federal taxpayer will be deemed to have the personal stake and interest that impart the necessary concrete adverseness to such litigation so that standing can be conferred on the taxpayer qua taxpayer consistent with the constitutional limitations of Article III.</p>
<p id="fb784fa0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nexus demanded of federal taxpayers has two aspects to it. First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, §8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged. Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, §8. When both nexuses are established, the litigant will have shown a taxpayer’s stake in the outcome of the controversy and will be a proper and appropriate party to invoke a federal court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="fb784fa1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The taxpayer-appellants in this case have satisfied both nexuses to support their claim of standing under the test we announce today. Their constitutional challenge is made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, §8, to spend for the general welfare, and the challenged program involves a substantial expenditure of federal tax funds. In addition, appellants have alleged that the challenged expenditures violate the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. Our history vividly illustrates that one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general. James Madison, who is generally recognized as the leading architect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment, observed in his famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments that “the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.” The concern of Madison and his supporters was quite clearly that religious liberty ultimately would be the victim if government could employ its taxing and spending powers to aid one religion over another or to aid religion in general. The Establishment Clause was designed as a specific bulwark against such potential abuses of governmental power, and that clause of the <span title="76" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-76">p. 76</span>First Amendment operates as a specific constitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power conferred by Art.

<p id="fb784fa3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s analysis consists principally of the observation that the requirements of standing are met if a taxpayer has the “requisite personal stake in the outcome” of this suit. This does not, of course, resolve the standing problem; it merely restates it. The Court implements this standard with the declaration that taxpayers will be “deemed” to have the necessary personal interest if their suits satisfy two criteria: first, the challenged expenditure must form part of a federal spending program, and not merely be “incidental” to a regulatory program; and second, the constitutional provision under which the plaintiff claims must be a “specific limitation” upon Congress’ spending powers. The difficulties with these criteria are many and severe, but it is enough for the moment to emphasize that they are not in any sense a measurement of any plaintiff’s interest in the outcome of any suit. As even a cursory examination of the criteria will show, the Court’s standard for the determination of standing and its criteria for the satisfaction of that standard are entirely unrelated.</p>
<p id="fb784fa4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is surely clear that a plaintiff’s interest in the outcome of a suit in which he challenges the constitutionality of a federal expenditure is not made greater or smaller by the unconnected fact that the expenditure is, or is not, “incidental” to an “essentially regulatory” program. An example will illustrate the point. Assume that two independent federal programs are authorized by Congress, that the first is designed to encourage a specified religious group by the provision to it of direct grants-in-aid, and that the second is designed to discourage all other religious groups by the imposition of various forms of discriminatory regulation. Equal amounts are appropriated by Congress for the two programs. If a taxpayer challenges their constitutionality in separate suits, are we to suppose, as evidently does the Court, that his “personal stake” in the suit involving the second is necessarily smaller than it is in the suit involving the first, and that he should therefore have standing in one but not the other?</p>
<p id="fb784fa5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s second criterion is similarly unrelated to its standard for the determination of standing. The intensity of a plaintiff’s interest in a suit is not measured, even obliquely, by the fact that the constitutional provision under which he claims is, or is not, a “specific limitation” upon Congress’ spending powers. I am quite unable to understand how, if a taxpayer believes that a given public expenditure is unconstitutional, and if he seeks to vindicate that belief in a federal court, his interest in the suit can be said necessarily to vary according to the constitutional provision under which he states his claim.</p>
<p id="fb784fa6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems to me clear that public actions, whatever the constitutional provisions on which they are premised, may involve important hazards for the continued effectiveness of the federal judiciary. Although I believe such actions to be within the jurisdiction conferred upon the federal courts by Article III of the Constitution, there surely can be little doubt that they strain the judicial function and press to the limit judicial authority. There is every reason to fear that unrestricted public actions might well alter the allocation of authority among the three branches of the Federal Government. It is not, I submit, enough to say that the present members of the Court would not seize these opportunities for abuse, for such actions would, even without conscious abuse, go far toward the final transformation of this Court into the Council of Revision which, despite <span title="77" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-77">p. 77</span>Madison’s support, was rejected by the Constitutional Convention. I do not doubt that there must be “some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions” of the Constitution’s several commands, but neither can I suppose that such power resides only in the federal courts. We must as judges recall that, as Mr. Justice Holmes wisely observed, the other branches of the Government “are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.” The powers of the federal judiciary will be adequate for the great burdens placed upon them only if they are employed prudently, with recognition of the strengths as well as the hazards that go with our kind of representative government.</p>

But <i>Flast</i> also never has been extended. Even in the context of the Establishment Clause, the Supreme Court has refused to extend <i>Flast</i> beyond challenges to expenditures. In Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464 (1982), the Court held that taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the federal government’s decision to grant property or its power to dispose of property under Article IV, §3. The Court held that taxpayers have standing only to challenge <i>expenditures</i> under Congress’s Article I, §8 spending power as violating the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fb7876b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation, 551 U.S. 587 (2007), the Court further limited Flast v. Cohen and held that taxpayers lacked standing to challenge expenditures from general executive revenue as violating the Establishment Clause. President George W. Bush created the Faith-Based and Community Initiatives program to allow faith-based programs, such as churches, synagogues, and mosques, to receive federal funds. A challenge was brought to conferences and speeches that were done in conjunction with the program. The Court noted that “Congress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds to pay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged. Instead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general Executive Branch appropriations.”</p>
<p id="fb7876b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court denied standing. Justice Alito wrote a plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy and said that <i>Flast</i> v. Cohen was distinguishable: “The expenditures at issue in <i>Flast</i> were made pursuant to an express congressional mandate and a specific congressional appropriation. . . . The . . . link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <i>Flast</i> is missing here. Respondents do not challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation; nor do they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional. That is because the expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress. Rather, Congress provided general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities. These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures of which respondents complain. Those expenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action. We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.”</p>
<p id="fb7876ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Scalia and Thomas concurred in the judgment and would have overruled Flast v.

Cohen</i> (1968) should be applied to (at a minimum) all challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or <i>Flast</i> should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. <i>Flast</i> is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing.”</p>
<p id="fb7876bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Souter wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer and would have allowed standing under Flast v. Cohen. Justice Souter wrote, “[T]he controlling opinion closes the door on these taxpayers because the Executive Branch, and not the Legislative Branch, caused their injury. I see no basis for this distinction in either logic or precedent, and respectfully dissent. . . . Here, there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. The taxpayers therefore seek not to “extend” <i>Flast</i>, but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury.”</p>
<p id="fb7876bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, most recently in Arizona School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125 (2011), the Court ruled five to four that taxpayers lacked standing to challenge an Arizona law that allowed taxpayers to obtain tax credits tax of up to $500 per person and $1,000 per married couple for contributions to school tuition organizations (STOs). The record demonstrated that the vast majority of funds from these STOs went to religious schools. Justice Kennedy, in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, distinguished Flast v. Cohen and said that there is a difference between government expenditures and tax credits, even when both benefit religion:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb7876bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction between governmental expenditures and tax credits refutes respondents’ assertion of standing. When Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs, they spend their own money, not money the State has collected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Arizona’s §43-1089 does not “extrac[t] and spen[d]” a conscientious dissenter’s funds in service of an establishment, or “‘force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property’” to a sectarian organization. On the contrary, respondents and other Arizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills, without contributing to an STO. Respondents are likewise able to contribute to an STO of their choice, either religious or secular. And respondents also have the option of contributing to other charitable organizations, in which case respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction or a different tax credit. The STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not visit the injury identified in <i>Flast</i>. It follows that respondents have neither alleged an injury for standing purposes under general rules nor met the <i>Flast</i> exception. Finding standing under these circumstances would be more than the extension of <i>Flast</i> “to the limits of its logic.” It would be a departure from <i>Flast</i>’s stated rationale.</p>

<p id="fb7876bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since its inception, the Arizona private-school-tuition tax credit has cost the State, by its own estimate, nearly $350 million in diverted tax revenue. . . . Beginning in <i>Flast v. Cohen</i> (1968), and continuing in case after case for over four decades, this Court and others have exercised jurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not materially different from this one. Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing to hear taxpayers’ claims that the government has unconstitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system. These litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because the funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax credit, rather than an appropriation. A tax credit, the Court asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because it “does not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an establishment.</p>
<p id="fb789dd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This novel distinction in standing law between appropriations and tax expenditures has as little basis in principle as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same government objective—to provide financial support to select individuals or organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state aid of religion have equal reason to protest whether that aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either way, the government has financed the religious activity. And so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge the subsidy. Precisely because appropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objectives, the government can easily substitute one for the other. Today’s opinion thus enables the government to end-run <i>Flast</i> ’s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From now on, the government need follow just one simple rule—subsidize through the tax system—to preclude taxpayer challenges to state funding of religion.</p>
<p id="fb789dd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose a State desires to reward Jews—by, say, $500 per year—for their religious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers’ concern vary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their tax returns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend? Or assume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of crucifixes. It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and distribute them to all takers. Or it could mail a reimbursement check to any individual who buys her own and submits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize that person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she paid. Now, really—do taxpayers have less reason to complain if the State selects the last of these three options? The Court today says they do, but that is wrong. The effect of each form of subsidy is the same, on the public fisc and on those who contribute to it. Regardless of which mechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an identical stake in ensuring that the State’s exercise of its taxing and spending power complies with the Constitution.</p>

<p id="fb789dd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third major justiciability doctrine is ripeness. Ripeness, like mootness (discussed in the next section), is a justiciability doctrine determining when review is appropriate. While standing is concerned with who is a proper party to litigate a particular matter, ripeness and mootness determine when that litigation may occur. Specifically, the ripeness doctrine seeks to separate matters that are premature for review because the injury is speculative and never may occur, from those cases that are appropriate for federal court action.</p>
<p id="fb789dd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an obvious overlap with the injury requirement in the standing doctrine. In order to have standing, the plaintiff must demonstrate that an injury has occurred or imminently will occur. In order for the case to be ripe, the plaintiff must show that review is not premature; that is, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a harm has occurred or imminently will occur.</p>

Ripeness, though, usually is used to ask a more specific question: When may a party seek pre-enforcement review of a statute or regulation? Customarily, a person can challenge the legality of a statute or regulation when he or she is prosecuted for violating it. There is an unfairness, however, to requiring a person to violate a law in order to challenge it. A person might unnecessarily obey an unconstitutional law, refraining from the prohibited conduct, rather than risk criminal punishments. Alternatively, a person might violate a statute or regulation, confident that it will be invalidated, only to be punished when the law is upheld. A primary purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act was to permit people to avoid this choice and obtain pre-enforcement review of statutes and regulations. Ripeness, then, is best understood as the determination of whether a federal court can grant pre-enforcement review; for example, when may a court hear a request for a declaratory judgment, or when must it decline review?</p>

In proceedings seeking declarations of law, not on review of convictions for violation of the statutes, that court has ruled that these statutes would be applicable in the case of married couples and even under claim that conception would constitute a serious threat to the health or life of the female spouse.</p>
<p id="fb78c4ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No. 60 combines two actions brought in a Connecticut Superior Court for declaratory relief. The complaint in the first alleges that the plaintiffs, Paul and Pauline Poe, are a husband and wife, thirty and twenty-six years old respectively, who live together and have no children. Mrs. Poe has had three consecutive pregnancies terminating in infants with multiple congenital abnormalities from which each died shortly after birth. Plaintiffs have consulted Dr. Buxton, an obstetrician and gynecologist of eminence, and it is Dr. Buxton’s opinion that the cause of the infants’ abnormalities is genetic, although the underlying “mechanism” is unclear. In view of the great emotional stress already suffered by plaintiffs, the probable consequence of another pregnancy is psychological strain extremely disturbing to the physical and mental health of both husband and wife. Plaintiffs know that it is Dr. Buxton’s opinion that the best and safest medical treatment which could be prescribed for their situation is advice in methods of preventing conception. Dr. Buxton knows of drugs, medicinal articles and instruments which can be <span title="81" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-81">p. 81</span>safely used to effect contraception. Medically, the use of these devices is indicated as the best and safest preventive measure necessary for the protection of plaintiffs’ health. Plaintiffs, however, have been unable to obtain this information for the sole reason that its delivery and use may or will be claimed by the defendant State’s Attorney (appellee in this Court) to constitute offenses against Connecticut law.</p>

Mrs. Doe, it is alleged, lives with her husband, they have no children; Mrs. Doe recently underwent a pregnancy which induced in her a critical physical illness—two weeks’ unconsciousness and a total of nine weeks’ acute sickness which left her with partial paralysis, marked impairment of speech, and emotional instability. Another pregnancy would be exceedingly perilous to her life. She, too, has consulted Dr. Buxton, who believes that the best and safest treatment for her is contraceptive advice.</p>

<p id="fb78c4f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraceptives has been on the State’s books since 1879. During the more than three-quarters of a century since its enactment, a prosecution for its violation seems never to have been initiated, save in State v. Nelson. The circumstances of that case, decided in 1940, only prove the abstract character of what is before us. There, a test case was brought to determine the constitutionality of the Act as applied against two doctors and a nurse who had allegedly disseminated contraceptive information. After the Supreme Court of Errors sustained the legislation on appeal from a demurrer to the information, the State moved to dismiss the information. Neither counsel nor our own researchers have discovered any other attempt to enforce the prohibition of distribution or use of contraceptive devices by criminal process. The unreality of these law suits is illumined by another circumstance. We were advised by counsel for appellants that contraceptives are commonly and notoriously sold in Connecticut drug stores. Yet no prosecutions are recorded; and certainly such ubiquitous, open, public sales would more quickly invite the attention of enforcement officials than the conduct in which the present appellants wish to engage—the giving of private medical advice by a doctor to his individual patients, and their private use of the devices prescribed.</p>
<p id="fb78c4f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insofar as appellants seek to justify the exercise of our declaratory power by the threat of prosecution, facts which they can no more negative by complaint and demurrer than they could by stipulation preclude our determining their appeals on the merits. It is clear that the mere existence of a state penal statute would constitute insufficient grounds to support a federal court’s adjudication of its constitutionality in proceedings brought against the State’s prosecuting officials if real threat of enforcement is wanting. The fact that Connecticut has not chosen to press the enforcement of this statute deprives these controversies of the immediacy which is an indispensable condition of constitutional adjudication. This Court cannot be umpire to debates concerning harmless, empty shadows. To find it necessary to pass on these statutes now, in order to protect appellants from the hazards of prosecution, would be to close our eyes to reality.</p>

This couple have been unable to get medical advice concerning the “best and safest” means to avoid pregnancy from their physician, plaintiff in No. 61, because if he gave it he would commit a crime. The use of contraceptive devices would also constitute a crime.

A sick wife, a concerned husband, a conscientious doctor seek a dignified, discrete, orderly answer to the critical problem confronting them. We should not turn them away and make them flout the law and get arrested to have their constitutional rights determined. They are entitled to an answer to their predicament here and now.</p>

The Court declared the law unconstitutional as violating the right to privacy. <i>Griswold</i> is presented in Chapter 8 in connection with the discussion of privacy and reproductive autonomy.

The underlying purpose of the 1962 amendment was to bring to the attention of doctors and patients the fact that many of the drugs sold under familiar trade names are actually identical to drugs sold under their “established” or less familiar trade names at significantly lower prices.</p>
<p id="fb78ec11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present action was brought by a group of 37 individual drug manufacturers and by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, of which all the petitioner companies are members, and which includes manufacturers of more than 90% of the Nation’s supply of prescription drugs. They challenged the regulations on the ground that the Commissioner exceeded his authority under the statute by promulgating an order requiring labels, advertisements, and other printed matter relating to prescription drugs to designate the established name of the particular drug involved every time its trade name is used anywhere in such material.</p>
<p id="fb78ec12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The injunctive and declaratory judgment remedies are discretionary, and courts traditionally have been reluctant to apply them to administrative determinations unless these arise in the context of a controversy “ripe” for judicial resolution. Without undertaking to survey the intricacies of the ripeness doctrine it is fair to say that its basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. The problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.</p>
<p id="fb78ec13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the former factor, we believe the issues presented are appropriate for judicial resolution at this time. [A]ll parties agree that the issue tendered is a purely legal one: whether the statute was properly construed by the Commissioner to require the established name of the drug to be used every time the proprietary name is employed.</p>
<p id="fb78ec14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is also a case in which the impact of the regulations upon the petitioners is sufficiently direct and immediate as to render the issue appropriate for judicial review at this stage. These regulations purport to give an authoritative interpretation of a statutory provision that has a direct effect on the day-to-day business of all prescription drug companies; its promulgation puts petitioners in a dilemma that it was the very purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to ameliorate. As the District Court found on the basis of uncontested allegations, “Either they must comply with the every time requirement and incur the costs of changing over their promotional material and labeling or they must follow their present course and risk prosecution.” If petitioners wish to comply they must change all their labels, advertisements, and promotional materials; they must destroy stocks of printed matter; and they must invest heavily in new printing type and new supplies. The alternative to compliance—continued use of material which they believe in good faith meets the statutory requirements, but which clearly does not meet the regulation of the Commissioner—may be even more costly. That course would risk serious criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful distribution of “misbranded” drugs.</p><span title="84" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-84">p. 84</span>

The Court found their claims to be not ripe. The Court said that the plaintiffs “seem clearly to seek advisory opinions upon broad claims. . . . A hypothetical threat is not enough.

The Court explained that the “question in this case is whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is justiciable—and in particular, whether they have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of Article III.” A member of Congress initiated proceedings against the Susan B.

<p id="fb79394a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One exception to the mootness doctrine is for “wrongs capable of repetition but evading review.” Some injuries are of such short duration that inevitably they are over before the federal court proceedings are completed. A case is <span title="86" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-86">p. 86</span>not dismissed, even though it is moot, if there is an injury likely to recur in the future and it is possible that it could happen to the plaintiff again, and it is of such a short duration that it likely always will evade review. Consider and compare the following three cases that discussed this exception to the mootness doctrine:</p>


<div id="fb79605b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead">

<p id="fb79605c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MOORE v. OGILVIE, 394 U.S. 814 (1969): Illinois law required that a petition to nominate candidates for the general election for a new political party be signed by at least 25,000 qualified voters, including 200 qualified voters from each of at least 50 counties. In 1968, the plaintiffs filed petitions for inclusion on the ballot but were denied this because they did not meet the requirement for the number of signatures in each county. They immediately filed suit, but, of course, the election was over by the time the Supreme Court heard the case.</p>
<p id="fb79605d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said, “[Defendants] urged in a motion to dismiss that since the November 5, 1968, election has been held, there is no possibility of granting any relief to appellants and that the appeal should be dismissed. But while the 1968 election is over, the burden allowed to be placed on the nomination of candidates for statewide offices remains and controls future elections, as long as Illinois maintains her present system as she has done since 1935. The problem is therefore ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’ The need for its resolution thus reflects a continuing controversy in the federal-state area where our ‘one man, one vote’ decisions have thrust.”</p>

WADE, 410 U.S. 113 (1973): Roe was a pregnant woman in Texas who filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the Texas law prohibiting abortion was unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the law. At the time she filed her suit in 1970, she alleged that she was in the first trimester of her pregnancy and seeking an abortion. Obviously, when the Supreme Court decided her case in 1973, she was no longer pregnant. The defendant moved to dismiss on mootness grounds.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10FD4_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10FD4_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span></p>
<p id="fb796061-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court stated, “Viewing Roe’s case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until as late as May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those statutes. The usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at all stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated.</p>
<p id="fb796062-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“But when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’</p>

ODEGAARD, 416 U.S. 312 (1974): Marco DeFunis, a white male, was denied admission to the University of Washington Law School. He filed suit challenging his denial of admission on the ground that the university’s affirmative action program denied him equal protection. The case was not filed as a class action suit. He received a preliminary injunction and was allowed to attend law school while the suit was pending. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, DeFunis was a third-year law student. The university stated that he would be allowed to finish school no matter what the Court’s ruling.</p>
<p id="fb796066-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court explained, “The starting point for analysis is the familiar proposition that ‘federal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.’ The inability of the federal judiciary ‘to review moot cases derives from the requirement of Art. III of the Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.’</p>
<p id="fb796067-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“It might be suggested that this case presents a question that is ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review,’ and is thus amenable to federal adjudication even though it might otherwise be considered moot. But DeFunis will never again be required to run the gauntlet of the Law School’s admission process, and so the question is certainly not ‘capable of repetition’ so far as he is concerned. Moreover, just because this particular case did not reach the Court until the eve of the petitioner’s graduation from Law School, it hardly follows that the issue he raises will in the future evade review. If the admissions procedures of the Law School remain unchanged, there is no reason to suppose that a subsequent case attacking those procedures will not come with relative speed to this Court, now that the Supreme Court of Washington has spoken. This case, therefore, in no way presents the exceptional situation in which the doctrine might permit a departure from ‘[t]he usual rule in federal cases . . . that an actual controversy must exist at all stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated.’</p>
<p id="fb798778-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Because the petitioner will complete his law school studies at the end of the term for which he has now registered regardless of any decision this Court might reach on the merits of this litigation, we conclude that the Court cannot, consistently with the limitations of Art. III of the Constitution, consider the substantive constitutional issues tendered by the parties.”</p>

It is well settled that “a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.” “[I]f it did, the courts would be compelled to leave ‘[t]he defendant . . . free to return to his old ways.’” In accordance with this principle, the standard we have announced for determining whether a case has been mooted by the defendant’s voluntary conduct is stringent: “A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” The “heavy burden of persua[ding]” the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.</p>
<p id="fb798783-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. Laidlaw also asserts that the closure of its Roebuck facility, which took place after the Court of Appeals issued its decision, mooted the case. The facility closure, like Laidlaw’s earlier achievement of substantial compliance with its permit requirements, might moot the case, but—we once more reiterate—only if one or the other of these events made it absolutely clear that Laidlaw’s permit violations could not reasonably be expected to recur. The effect of both Laidlaw’s compliance and the facility closure on the prospect of future violations is a disputed factual matter. FOE points out, for example—and Laidlaw does not appear to contest—that Laidlaw retains its NPDES permit. These issues have not been aired in the lower courts; they remain open for consideration on remand.</p>

<p id="fb79ae9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A federal prisoner, after twice being denied parole from a federal prison, brought suit challenging the validity of the U.S. Parole Commission’s Parole Release Guidelines. The district court denied respondent’s request for certification of the suit as a class action on behalf of a class of “all federal prisoners who are or who will become eligible for release on parole,” and granted summary judgment for petitioners on the merits. Respondent was released from prison while his appeal to the court of appeals was pending.]</p>
<p id="fb79ae9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb79ae9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case raises the question whether a trial court’s denial of a motion for certification of a class may be reviewed on appeal after the named plaintiff’s personal claim has become “moot.”</p>
<p id="fb79ae9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that the controversy over the validity of the Parole Release Guidelines is still a “live” one between petitioners and at least some members of the class respondent seeks to represent. This is demonstrated by the fact that prisoners currently affected by the guidelines have moved to be substituted, or to intervene, as “named” respondents in this Court.</p>
<p id="fb79ae9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On several occasions the Court has considered the application of the “personal stake” requirement in the class-action context. In Sosna v. Iowa (1975), it held that mootness of the named plaintiff’s individual claim after a class has been duly certified does not render the action moot. It reasoned that “even though appellees . . . might not again enforce the Iowa durational residency requirement against [the class representative], it is clear that they will enforce it against those persons in the class that appellant sought to represent and that the District Court certified.” The Court stated specifically that an Art. III case or controversy “may exist . . . between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot.”</p>
<p id="fb79d5b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When, however, there is no chance that the named plaintiff’s expired claim will reoccur, mootness still can be avoided through certification of a class prior to expiration of the named plaintiff’s personal claim. E.g., Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co. (1976). Some claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative’s individual interest expires.</p>
<p id="fb79d5b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases demonstrate the flexible character of the Art. III mootness doctrine. As has been noted in the past, Art. III justiciability is “not a legal concept with a fixed content or susceptible of scientific verification.” “[T]he justiciability doctrine [is] one of uncertain and shifting contours.”</p>
<p id="fb79d5b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, the purpose of the “personal stake” requirement is to assure that the case is in a form capable of judicial resolution. The imperatives of a dispute capable of judicial resolution are sharply presented issues in a concrete factual setting and self-interested parties vigorously advocating opposing positions. We conclude that these elements can exist with respect to the class certification issue notwithstanding the fact that the named plaintiff’s claim on the merits has expired. The question whether class certification is <span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>appropriate remains as a concrete, sharply presented issue. In Sosna v. Iowa it was recognized that a named plaintiff whose claim on the merits expires after class certification may still adequately represent the class. Implicit in that decision was the determination that vigorous advocacy can be assured through means other than the traditional requirement of a “personal stake in the outcome.” Respondent here continues vigorously to advocate his right to have a class certified.</p>
<p id="fb79d5b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that an action brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff’s substantive claim, even though class certification has been denied. The proposed representative retains a “personal stake” in obtaining class certification sufficient to assure that Art. III values are not undermined. If the appeal results in reversal of the class certification denial, and a class subsequently is properly certified, the merits of the class claim then may be adjudicated pursuant to the holding in <i>Sosna</i>.</p>

<p id="fb79d5b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The political question doctrine refers to allegations of constitutional violations that federal courts will not adjudicate, and that the Supreme Court deems to be inappropriate for judicial review. The Court has held that some constitutional provisions are left to the political branches of government to interpret and enforce. Although there is an allegation that the Constitution has been violated, cases brought under these provisions are dismissed as nonjusticiable political questions.</p>
<p id="fb79d5b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The underlying question is whether there should be a political question doctrine. Critics of the political question doctrine argue that it is wrong to leave some constitutional provisions solely to the political branches to interpret and enforce.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110B0_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N110B0_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">37</a></span> The argument is that the Constitution is meant to insulate matters from the political process and therefore it is wrong to leave constitutional provisions to the elected branches of government to interpret and enforce.</p>
<p id="fb79fccb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the political question doctrine is defended on separation of powers grounds; the Constitution is seen as assigning certain provisions to the other branches of government. Moreover, defenders of the political question doctrine argue that it minimizes judicial intrusion into the operations of the other branches of government and that it allocates decisions to the branches of government that have superior expertise in particular areas. For example, some argue that the Court rightly has treated many constitutional issues concerning foreign policy to be political questions because of the greater information and expertise of the other branches of government.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110C2_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N110C2_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">38</a></span></p><span title="91" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-91">p. 91</span>

THE ISSUES OF MALAPPORTIONMENT AND PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING</p></h3></div>


<p id="fb79fccf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has applied the political question doctrine almost throughout American history. Baker v. Carr, below, is the most famous articulation of the criteria for determining what is a political question. <i>Baker</i> involves the question of whether an equal protection challenge to malapportionment of state legislatures is a nonjusticiable political question. To understand <i>Baker</i>, it is important to know that the Court rejected an earlier challenge to malapportionment based on the “Guaranty Clause.” This clause is found in Article IV, §4 of the Constitution: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.” In Colegrove v. Green, in 1946, the Court held that challenges to malapportionment under this provision are a nonjusticiable political question.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110E6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N110E6_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">39</a></span></p>
<p id="fb79fcd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the Supreme Court long has refused to find cases under the Guaranty Clause justiciable. In Luther v. Borden, in 1849, the Court refused to hear a challenge to the Rhode Island government under the Guaranty Clause<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110EF_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N110EF_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">40</a></span> after the voters of Rhode Island adopted a new state constitution, in part in response to significant malapportionment in the state legislature. After this enactment, the existing government, which was sure to lose power under the new document, enacted a law prohibiting the constitution from going into effect. Nonetheless, elections were held—even though the existing government had declared voting in them to be a crime. Relatively few people participated, but a new government was chosen, led by Thomas Dorr, who was elected governor. Dorr’s government met for two days in an abandoned foundry and then disbanded.</p>
<p id="fb79fcd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In April 1842, a sheriff, L. Borden, broke into the house of one of the election commissioners, Martin Luther, to search for evidence of illegal participation in the prohibited election. Luther sued Borden for trespass. Borden claimed that the search was a lawful exercise of government power. Luther, however, contended that Borden acted pursuant to an unconstitutional government’s orders; he maintained that the Rhode Island government violated the Republican Form of Government Clause.</p>
<p id="fb7a23e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court held that the case posed a political question that could not be decided by a federal court. The Court stated: “Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not.” The Court also explained that the case posed a political question because if the state’s government was declared unconstitutional, then all of its actions would be invalidated, creating chaos in Rhode Island.</p>
<p id="fb7a23e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court never has varied from this holding: Cases under the Guaranty Clause are nonjusticiable. Colegrove v. Green followed this in refusing to adjudicate a challenge to malapportionment under the Guaranty Clause. The <span title="92" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-92">p. 92</span>issue in Baker v. Carr is whether the same challenge is justiciable when brought under equal protection. As you read Baker v. Carr, compare the views of the majority and dissenting opinions as to the appropriate role of the judiciary.</p>

<p id="fb7a23eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fb7a23ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection “is little more than a play upon words.” Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government, and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.</p>
<p id="fb7a4afd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. [I]n the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other “political question” cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary’s relationship to the States, which gives rise to the “political question.”</p>
<p id="fb7a4afe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have said that “In determining whether a question falls within (the political question) category, the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations.” The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the “political question” label to obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb7a4aff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.</p>
<p id="fb7a4b00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After describing the cases under the Guaranty Clause, the Court explained:] But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it <span title="93" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-93">p. 93</span>does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.</p>
<p id="fb7a4b01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought “political,” can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define “political questions,” and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization.</p>
<p id="fb7a4b02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, [w]e conclude that the complaint’s allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fb7a4b04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representation—a wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme.</p>
<p id="fb7a4b05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court’s “judicial Power” not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court’s position as the ultimate organ of “the supreme Law of the Land” in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court’s authority—possessed of neither the purse nor the sword—ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court’s complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.</p>
<p id="fb7a4b06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd—indeed an esoteric—conception of judicial propriety. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To <span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-94">p. 94</span>charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.</p>
<p id="fb7a7217-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In effect, today’s decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court’s notion of what is proper districting.</p>
<p id="fb7a7218-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people’s representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope.</p>
<p id="fb7a7219-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. To find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. Certainly, “equal protection” is no more secure a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is “Republican Form.”</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fb7a721a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, the Court held that apportionment must meet the standard of one person, one vote; that is, all districts must be approximately equal in population size.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1116F_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1116F_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">41</a></span> These cases are discussed in Chapter 8.</p>
<p id="fb7a721c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also had occasion to consider justiciability in the election context in deciding whether challenges to political gerrymandering constitute a political question. In Davis v. Bandemer, the plaintiffs contended that the Republican-controlled Indiana legislature gerrymandered the drawing of election districts to maximize the election of Republican representatives.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1117B_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1117B_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">42</a></span> The Supreme Court held that the claim was justiciable. The Court explained that “the standards that we set forth here for adjudicating this political gerrymandering claim are [no] less manageable than the standards that have been developed for racial gerrymandering claims.” Accordingly, the Court held that “political gerrymandering cases are properly justiciable under the Equal Protection Clause.”</p>
<p id="fb7a721e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2004, in Vieth v. Jublierer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004), the Court held, 5-4, that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are non-justiciable political questions. Justice Scalia wrote the plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, saying that there are not judicially discoverable or manageable standards for when gerrymandering violates the Constitution. Justice Kennedy, the fifth justice in the <span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span>majority, wrote separately to say that there weren’t standards at that time, but left open the possibility of standards in the future.</p>

<p id="fb7a9936-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Voters and other plaintiffs in North Carolina and Maryland challenged their States’ congressional districting maps as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The North Carolina plaintiffs complained that the State’s districting plan discriminated against Democrats; the Maryland plaintiffs complained that their State’s plan discriminated against Republicans. The plaintiffs alleged that the gerrymandering violated the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Elections Clause, and Article I, §2, of the Constitution. The District Courts in both cases ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and the defendants appealed directly to this Court.</p>
<p id="fb7a9937-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases require us to consider once again whether claims of excessive partisanship in districting are “justiciable”—that is, properly suited for resolution by the federal courts. This Court has not previously struck down a districting plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, and has struggled without success over the past several decades to discern judicially manageable standards for deciding such claims. The districting plans at issue here are highly partisan, by any measure. The question is whether the courts below appropriately exercised judicial power when they found them unconstitutional as well.</p>

<p id="fb7a9939-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first case involves a challenge to the congressional redistricting plan enacted by the Republican-controlled North Carolina General Assembly in 2016. The Republican legislators leading the redistricting effort instructed their mapmaker to use political data to draw a map that would produce a congressional delegation of ten Republicans and three Democrats. As one of the two Republicans chairing the redistricting committee stated, “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.” He further explained that the map was drawn with the aim of electing ten Republicans and three Democrats because he did “not believe it [would be] possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Democrats.” One Democratic state senator objected that entrenching the 10-3 advantage for Republicans was not “fair, reasonable, [or] balanced” because, as recently as 2012, “Democratic congressional candidates had received more votes on a statewide basis than Republican candidates.” The General Assembly was not swayed by that objection and approved the 2016 Plan by a party-line vote.</p>
<p id="fb7a993a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 2016, North Carolina conducted congressional elections using the 2016 Plan, and Republican candidates won 10 of the 13 congressional <span title="96" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-96">p. 96</span>districts. In the 2018 elections, Republican candidates won nine congressional districts, while Democratic candidates won three. The Republican candidate narrowly prevailed in the remaining district, but the State Board of Elections called a new election after allegations of fraud.</p>
<p id="fb7a993b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second case before us is Lamone v. Benisek. In 2011, the Maryland Legislature—dominated by Democrats—undertook to redraw the lines of that State’s eight congressional districts. The Governor at the time, Democrat Martin O’Malley, led the process. He appointed a redistricting committee to help redraw the map, and asked Congressman Steny Hoyer, who has described himself as a “serial gerrymanderer,” to advise the committee. The Governor later testified that his aim was to “use the redistricting process to change the overall composition of Maryland’s congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican by flipping” one district. The map was adopted by a party-line vote. It was used in the 2012 election and succeeded in flipping the Sixth District. A Democrat has held the seat ever since.</p>

<p id="fb7a993d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts to deciding “Cases” and “Controversies.” We have understood that limitation to mean that federal courts can address only questions “historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.” In these cases we are asked to decide an important question of constitutional law. “But before we do so, we must find that the question is presented in a ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ that is, in James Madison’s words, ‘of a Judiciary Nature.’”</p>
<p id="fb7a993e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Marshall famously wrote that it is “the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison (1803). Sometimes, however, “the law is that the judicial department has no business entertaining the claim of unlawfulness—because the question is entrusted to one of the political branches or involves no judicially enforceable rights.” Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004) (plurality opinion). In such a case the claim is said to present a “political question” and to be nonjusticiable—outside the courts’ competence and therefore beyond the courts’ jurisdiction. Baker v. Carr (1962). Among the political question cases the Court has identified are those that lack “judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving [them].”</p>
<p id="fb7a993f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Partisan gerrymandering is nothing new. Nor is frustration with it. The practice was known in the Colonies prior to Independence, and the Framers were familiar with it at the time of the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. During the very first congressional elections, George Washington and his Federalist allies accused Patrick Henry of trying to gerrymander Virginia’s districts against their candidates—in particular James Madison, who ultimately prevailed over fellow future President James Monroe. In 1812, Governor of Massachusetts and future Vice President Elbridge Gerry notoriously approved congressional districts that the legislature had drawn to aid the Democratic-Republican Party. The moniker “gerrymander” was born when an outraged Federalist newspaper observed that one of the misshapen districts resembled a salamander. “By 1840, the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of <span title="97" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-97">p. 97</span>election districts. It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.”</p>
<p id="fb7a9940-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Framers addressed the election of Representatives to Congress in the Elections Clause. Art. I, §4, cl. 1. That provision assigns to state legislatures the power to prescribe the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections” for Members of Congress, while giving Congress the power to “make or alter” any such regulations. Congress has regularly exercised its Elections Clause power, including to address partisan gerrymandering. The Apportionment Act of 1842, which required single-member districts for the first time, specified that those districts be “composed of contiguous territory,” Congress also used its Elections Clause power in 1870, enacting the first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections as a way to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. Starting in the 1950s, Congress enacted a series of laws to protect the right to vote through measures such as the suspension of literacy tests and the prohibition of English-only elections.</p>
<p id="fb7a9941-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Framers were aware of electoral districting problems and considered what to do about them. They settled on a characteristic approach, assigning the issue to the state legislatures, expressly checked and balanced by the Federal Congress.</p>
<p id="fb7ac052-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have nevertheless been called upon to resolve a variety of questions surrounding districting. Early on, doubts were raised about the competence of the federal courts to resolve those questions.</p>
<p id="fb7ac053-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hold that legislators cannot take partisan interests into account when drawing district lines would essentially countermand the Framers’ decision to entrust districting to political entities. The “central problem” is not determining whether a jurisdiction has engaged in partisan gerrymandering. It is “determining when political gerrymandering has gone too far.”</p>

<p id="fb7ac055-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable, we are mindful of Justice Kennedy’s counsel in <i>Vieth</i>: Any standard for resolving such claims must be grounded in a “limited and precise rationale” and be “clear, manageable, and politically neutral.” An important reason for those careful constraints is that, as a Justice with extensive experience in state and local politics put it, “[t]he opportunity to control the drawing of electoral boundaries through the legislative process of apportionment is a critical and traditional part of politics in the United States.” An expansive standard requiring “the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.”</p>
<p id="fb7ac056-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, the question is one of degree: How to “provid[e] a standard for deciding how much partisan dominance is too much.” And it is vital in such circumstances that the Court act only in accord with especially clear standards: “With uncertain limits, intervening courts—even when proceeding with best intentions—would risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.” If federal courts are to “inject [themselves] into the most heated partisan issues” by adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims, they must be armed with a standard that can reliably differentiate unconstitutional from “constitutional political gerrymandering.”</p>
<p id="fb7ac057-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="98" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-98">p. 98</span>Partisan gerrymandering claims rest on an instinct that groups with a certain level of political support should enjoy a commensurate level of political power and influence. Explicitly or implicitly, a districting map is alleged to be unconstitutional because it makes it too difficult for one party to translate statewide support into seats in the legislature. But such a claim is based on a “norm that does not exist” in our electoral system—“statewide elections for representatives along party lines.”</p>
<p id="fb7ac058-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Partisan gerrymandering claims invariably sound in a desire for proportional representation. As Justice O’Connor put it, such claims are based on “a conviction that the greater the departure from proportionality, the more suspect an apportionment plan becomes.” “Our cases, however, clearly foreclose any claim that the Constitution requires proportional representation or that legislatures in reapportioning must draw district lines to come as near as possible to allocating seats to the contending parties in proportion to what their anticipated statewide vote will be.”</p>
<p id="fb7ac059-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Founders certainly did not think proportional representation was required. For more than 50 years after ratification of the Constitution, many States elected their congressional representatives through at-large or “general ticket” elections. Such States typically sent single-party delegations to Congress. That meant that a party could garner nearly half of the vote statewide and wind up without any seats in the congressional delegation. The Whigs in Alabama suffered that fate in 1840: “their party garnered 43 percent of the statewide vote, yet did not receive a single seat.” When Congress required single-member districts in the Apportionment Act of 1842, it was not out of a general sense of fairness, but instead a (mis)calculation by the Whigs that such a change would improve their electoral prospects.</p>
<p id="fb7ac05a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unable to claim that the Constitution requires proportional representation outright, plaintiffs inevitably ask the courts to make their own political judgment about how much representation particular political parties <i>deserve</i>—based on the votes of their supporters—and to rearrange the challenged districts to achieve that end. But federal courts are not equipped to apportion political power as a matter of fairness, nor is there any basis for concluding that they were authorized to do so.</p>
<p id="fb7ac05b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The initial difficulty in settling on a “clear, manageable and politically neutral” test for fairness is that it is not even clear what fairness looks like in this context. There is a large measure of “unfairness” in any winner-take-all system. Fairness may mean a greater number of competitive districts. Such a claim seeks to undo packing and cracking so that supporters of the disadvantaged party have a better shot at electing their preferred candidates. But making as many districts as possible more competitive could be a recipe for disaster for the disadvantaged party. As Justice White has pointed out, “[i]f all or most of the districts are competitive . . . even a narrow statewide preference for either party would produce an overwhelming majority for the winning party in the state legislature.”</p>
<p id="fb7ac05c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, perhaps the ultimate objective of a “fairer” share of seats in the congressional delegation is most readily achieved by yielding to the gravitational pull of proportionality and engaging in cracking and packing, to ensure each party its “appropriate” share of “safe” seats. Such an approach, however, comes at the expense of competitive districts and of individuals in districts allocated to the opposing party.</p>
<p id="fb7ac05d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-99">p. 99</span>Or perhaps fairness should be measured by adherence to “traditional” districting criteria, such as maintaining political subdivisions, keeping communities of interest together, and protecting incumbents. But protecting incumbents, for example, enshrines a particular partisan distribution. And the “natural political geography” of a State—such as the fact that urban electoral districts are often dominated by one political party—can itself lead to inherently packed districts. As Justice Kennedy has explained, traditional criteria such as compactness and contiguity “cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief. Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.”</p>
<p id="fb7ae76e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deciding among just these different visions of fairness (you can imagine many others) poses basic questions that are political, not legal. There are no legal standards discernible in the Constitution for making such judgments, let alone limited and precise standards that are clear, manageable, and politically neutral. Any judicial decision on what is “fair” in this context would be an “unmoored determination” of the sort characteristic of a political question beyond the competence of the federal courts.</p>
<p id="fb7ae76f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And it is only after determining how to define fairness that you can even begin to answer the determinative question: “How much is too much?” At what point does permissible partisanship become unconstitutional? If compliance with traditional districting criteria is the fairness touchstone, for example, how much deviation from those criteria is constitutionally acceptable and how should mapdrawers prioritize competing criteria? Should a court “reverse gerrymander” other parts of a State to counteract “natural” gerrymandering caused, for example, by the urban concentration of one party? If a districting plan protected half of the incumbents but redistricted the rest into head to head races, would that be constitutional? A court would have to rank the relative importance of those traditional criteria and weigh how much deviation from each to allow.</p>
<p id="fb7ae770-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a court instead focused on the respective number of seats in the legislature, it would have to decide the ideal number of seats for each party and determine at what point deviation from that balance went too far. If a 5-3 allocation corresponds most closely to statewide vote totals, is a 6-2 allocation permissible, given that legislatures have the authority to engage in a certain degree of partisan gerrymandering? Which seats should be packed and which cracked? Or if the goal is as many competitive districts as possible, how close does the split need to be for the district to be considered competitive? Presumably not all districts could qualify, so how to choose? Even assuming the court knew which version of fairness to be looking for, there are no discernible and manageable standards for deciding whether there has been a violation. The questions are “unguided and ill suited to the development of judicial standards,” and “results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.”</p>
<p id="fb7ae771-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend that if we can adjudicate one-person, one-vote claims, we can also assess partisan gerrymandering claims. But the one-person, one-vote rule is relatively easy to administer as a matter of math. The same cannot be said of partisan gerrymandering claims, because the Constitution supplies no objective measure for assessing whether a districting map treats a political party fairly. It hardly follows from the principle that each person must have an equal say in the election of representatives that a person is entitled to have his political party achieve representation in some way commensurate to its share of statewide support.</p>
<p id="fb7ae772-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-100">p. 100</span>More fundamentally, “vote dilution” in the one-person, one-vote cases refers to the idea that each vote must carry equal weight. In other words, each representative must be accountable to (approximately) the same number of constituents. That requirement does not extend to political parties. It does not mean that each party must be influential in proportion to its number of supporters.</p>
<p id="fb7ae773-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do our racial gerrymandering cases provide an appropriate standard for assessing partisan gerrymandering. “[N]othing in our case law compels the conclusion that racial and political gerrymanders are subject to precisely the same constitutional scrutiny. In fact, our country’s long and persistent history of racial discrimination in voting—as well as our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, which always has reserved the strictest scrutiny for discrimination on the basis of race—would seem to compel the opposite conclusion.” Unlike partisan gerrymandering claims, a racial gerrymandering claim does not ask for a fair share of political power and influence, with all the justiciability conundrums that entails. It asks instead for the elimination of a racial classification. A partisan gerrymandering claim cannot ask for the elimination of partisanship.</p>

<p id="fb7ae775-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees and the dissent propose a number of “tests” for evaluating partisan gerrymandering claims, but none meets the need for a limited and precise standard that is judicially discernible and manageable. And none provides a solid grounding for judges to take the extraordinary step of reallocating power and influence between political parties.</p>
<p id="fb7ae776-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even the most sophisticated districting maps cannot reliably account for some of the reasons voters prefer one candidate over another, or why their preferences may change. Voters elect individual candidates in individual districts, and their selections depend on the issues that matter to them, the quality of the candidates, the tone of the candidates’ campaigns, the performance of an incumbent, national events or local issues that drive voter turnout, and other considerations. Many voters split their tickets. Others never register with a political party, and vote for candidates from both major parties at different points during their lifetimes. For all of those reasons, asking judges to predict how a particular districting map will perform in future elections risks basing constitutional holdings on unstable ground outside judicial expertise.</p>
<p id="fb7ae777-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Courts also found partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable under the First Amendment, coalescing around a basic three-part test: proof of intent to burden individuals based on their voting history or party affiliation; an actual burden on political speech or associational rights; and a causal link between the invidious intent and actual burden.</p>
<p id="fb7ae778-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin, there are no restrictions on speech, association, or any other First Amendment activities in the districting plans at issue. The plaintiffs are free to engage in those activities no matter what the effect of a plan may be on their district. The plaintiffs’ argument is that partisanship in districting should be regarded as simple discrimination against supporters of the opposing party on the basis of political viewpoint. Under that theory, any level of partisanship in districting would constitute an infringement of their First Amendment rights. But as the Court has explained, “[i]t would be idle . . . to contend that any political consideration taken into account in fashioning a reapportionment plan is <span title="101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-101">p. 101</span>sufficient to invalidate it.” The First Amendment test simply describes the act of districting for partisan advantage. It provides no standard for determining when partisan activity goes too far.</p>
<p id="fb7ae779-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent proposes using a State’s own districting criteria as a neutral baseline from which to measure how extreme a partisan gerrymander is. The dissent would have us line up all the possible maps drawn using those criteria according to the partisan distribution they would produce. Distance from the “median” map would indicate whether a particular districting plan harms supporters of one party to an unconstitutional extent.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an initial matter, it does not make sense to use criteria that will vary from State to State and year to year as the baseline for determining whether a gerrymander violates the Federal Constitution. The degree of partisan advantage that the Constitution tolerates should not turn on criteria offered by the gerrymanderers themselves. It is easy to imagine how different criteria could move the median map toward different partisan distributions. As a result, the same map could be constitutional or not depending solely on what the mapmakers said they set out to do. That possibility illustrates that the dissent’s proposed constitutional test is indeterminate and arbitrary.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were to accept the dissent’s proposed baseline, it would return us to “the original unanswerable question (How much political motivation and effect is too much?).” Would twenty percent away from the median map be okay? Forty percent? Sixty percent? Why or why not? (We appreciate that the dissent finds all the unanswerable questions annoying, but it seems a useful way to make the point.) The dissent’s answer says it all: “This much is too much.” That is not even trying to articulate a standard or rule.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent argues that there are other instances in law where matters of degree are left to the courts. True enough. But those instances typically involve constitutional or statutory provisions or common law confining and guiding the exercise of judicial discretion.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court asserted that partisan gerrymanders violate “the core principle of [our] republican government” preserved in Art. I, §2, “namely, that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.” That seems like an objection more properly grounded in the Guarantee Clause of Article IV, §4, which “guarantee[s] to every State in [the] Union a Republican Form of Government.” This Court has several times concluded, however, that the Guarantee Clause does not provide the basis for a justiciable claim.</p>

<p id="fb7b0e8f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust. But the fact that such gerrymandering is “incompatible with democratic principles,” does not mean that the solution lies with the federal judiciary. We conclude that partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. Federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties, with no plausible grant of authority in the Constitution, and no legal standards to limit and direct their decisions. “[J]udicial action must be governed by <i>standard</i>, by <i>rule</i>,” and must be “principled, rational, and based upon reasoned distinctions” found in the <span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>Constitution or laws. Judicial review of partisan gerrymandering does not meet those basic requirements.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e90-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the appellees and dissent seek is an unprecedented expansion of -judicial power. We have never struck down a partisan gerrymander as -unconstitutional—despite various requests over the past 45 years. The expansion of judicial authority would not be into just any area of controversy, but into one of the most intensely partisan aspects of American political life. That intervention would be unlimited in scope and duration—it would recur over and over again around the country with each new round of districting, for state as well as federal representatives. Consideration of the impact of today’s ruling on democratic principles cannot ignore the effect of the unelected and politically unaccountable branch of the Federal Government assuming such an extraordinary and unprecedented role.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e91-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion does not condone excessive partisan gerrymandering. Nor does our conclusion condemn complaints about districting to echo into a void. The States, for example, are actively addressing the issue on a number of fronts. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Florida struck down that State’s congressional districting plan as a violation of the Fair Districts Amendment to the Florida Constitution. The dissent wonders why we can’t do the same. The answer is that there is no “Fair Districts Amendment” to the Federal Constitution. Provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply. Indeed, numerous other States are restricting partisan considerations in districting through legislation. One way they are doing so is by placing power to draw electoral districts in the hands of independent commissions. Other States have mandated at least some of the traditional districting criteria for their mapmakers. Some have outright prohibited partisan favoritism in redistricting.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, the Framers gave Congress the power to do something about partisan gerrymandering in the Elections Clause. The first bill introduced in the 116th Congress would require States to create 15-member independent commissions to draw congressional districts and would establish certain redistricting criteria, including protection for communities of interest, and ban partisan gerrymandering. Another example is the Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act, which was introduced in 2005 and has been reintroduced in every Congress since. We express no view on any of these pending proposals. We simply note that the avenue for reform established by the Framers, and used by Congress in the past, remains open.</p>
<p id="fb7b0e93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one can accuse this Court of having a crabbed view of the reach of its competence. But we have no commission to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a constitutional directive or legal standards to guide us in the exercise of such authority. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” In this rare circumstance, that means our duty is to say “this is not law.”</p>
<p id="fb7b0e94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kagan</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fb7b35a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate <span title="103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-103">p. 103</span>equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerrymanders here debased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside-down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people. These gerrymanders enabled politicians to entrench themselves in office as against voters’ preferences. They promoted partisanship above respect for the popular will. They encouraged a politics of polarization and dysfunction. If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irreparably damage our system of government.</p>
<p id="fb7b35a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And checking them is <i>not</i> beyond the courts. The majority’s abdication comes just when courts across the country, including those below, have coalesced around manageable judicial standards to resolve partisan gerrymandering claims. Those standards satisfy the majority’s own benchmarks. They do not require—indeed, they do not permit—courts to rely on their own ideas of electoral fairness, whether proportional representation or any other. And they limit courts to correcting only egregious gerrymanders, so judges do not become omnipresent players in the political process. But yes, the standards used here do allow—as well they should—judicial intervention in the worst-of-the-worst cases of democratic subversion, causing blatant constitutional harms. In other words, they allow courts to undo partisan gerrymanders of the kind we face today from North Carolina and Maryland. In giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the majority goes tragically wrong.</p>

<p id="fb7b35a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maybe the majority errs in these cases because it pays so little attention to the constitutional harms at their core. After dutifully reciting each case’s facts, the majority leaves them forever behind, instead immersing itself in everything that could conceivably go amiss if courts became involved. So it is necessary to fill in the gaps. To recount exactly what politicians in North Carolina and Maryland did to entrench their parties in political office, whatever the electorate might think. And to elaborate on the constitutional injury those politicians wreaked, to our democratic system and to individuals’ rights. All that will help in considering whether courts confronting partisan gerrymandering claims are really so hamstrung—so unable to carry out their constitutional duties—as the majority thinks.</p>
<p id="fb7b35aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs here challenge two congressional districting plans—one adopted by Republicans in North Carolina and the other by Democrats in Maryland—as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. As I relate what happened in those two States, ask yourself: Is this how American democracy is supposed to work?</p>
<p id="fb7b35ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with North Carolina. After the 2010 census, the North Carolina General Assembly, with Republican majorities in both its House and its Senate, enacted a new congressional districting plan. That plan governed the two next national elections. In 2012, Republican candidates won 9 of the State’s 13 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, although they received only 49% of the statewide vote. In 2014, Republican candidates increased their total to 10 of the 13 seats, this time based on 55% of the vote. [After a federal court order, new districts were drawn and the person responsible declared:] “I think electing <span title="104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-104">p. 104</span>Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.”</p>
<p id="fb7b35ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You might think that judgment best left to the American people. In 2016, Republican congressional candidates won 10 of North Carolina’s 13 seats, with 53% of the statewide vote. Two years later, Republican candidates won 9 of 12 seats though they received only 50% of the vote. (The 13th seat has not yet been filled because fraud tainted the initial election.)</p>
<p id="fb7b35ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Events in Maryland make for a similarly grisly tale. For 50 years, Maryland’s 8-person congressional delegation typically consisted of 2 or 3 Republicans and 5 or 6 Democrats. Maryland’s Democrats proved no less successful than North Carolina’s Republicans in devising a voter-proof map. In the four elections that followed (from 2012 through 2018), Democrats have never received more than 65% of the statewide congressional vote. Yet in each of those elections, Democrats have won (you guessed it) 7 of 8 House seats—including the once-reliably-Republican Sixth District.</p>

<p id="fb7b35af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now back to the question I asked before: Is that how American democracy is supposed to work? I have yet to meet the person who thinks so. “Governments,” the Declaration of Independence states, “deriv[e] their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.” The Constitution begins: “We the People of the United States.” The Gettysburg Address (almost) ends: “[G]overnment of the people, by the people, for the people.” If there is a single idea that made our Nation (and that our Nation commended to the world), it is this one: The people are sovereign. The “power,” James Madison wrote, “is in the people over the Government, and not in the Government over the people.”</p>
<p id="fb7b35b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Free and fair and periodic elections are the key to that vision. The people get to choose their representatives. And then they get to decide, at regular intervals, whether to keep them. Madison again: “[R]epublican liberty” demands “not only, that all power should be derived from the people; but that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people.” Election day—next year, and two years later, and two years after that—is what links the people to their representatives, and gives the people their sovereign power. That day is the foundation of democratic governance.</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And partisan gerrymandering can make it meaningless. At its most extreme—as in North Carolina and Maryland—the practice amounts to “rigging elections.” By drawing districts to maximize the power of some voters and minimize the power of others, a party in office at the right time can entrench itself there for a decade or more, no matter what the voters would prefer. Just ask the people of North Carolina and Maryland. The “core principle of republican government,” this Court has recognized, is “that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.” Partisan gerrymandering turns it the other way around. By that mechanism, politicians can cherry-pick voters to ensure their reelection. And the power becomes, as Madison put it, “in the Government over the people.”</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority disputes none of this. I think it important to underscore that fact: The majority disputes none of what I have said (or will say) about how gerrymanders undermine democracy. Indeed, the majority concedes (really, how could it not?) that gerrymandering is “incompatible with democratic principles.”</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And therefore what? That recognition would seem to demand a response. The majority offers two ideas that might qualify as such. One is that the political <span title="105" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-105">p. 105</span>process can deal with the problem—a proposition so dubious on its face that I feel secure in delaying my answer for some time. The other is that political gerrymanders have always been with us. To its credit, the majority does not frame that point as an originalist constitutional argument. After all (as the majority rightly notes), racial and residential gerrymanders were also once with us, but the Court has done something about that fact. The majority’s idea instead seems to be that if we have lived with partisan gerrymanders so long, we will survive.</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That complacency has no cause. Yes, partisan gerrymandering goes back to the Republic’s earliest days. (As does vociferous opposition to it.) But big data and modern technology—of just the kind that the mapmakers in North Carolina and Maryland used—make today’s gerrymandering altogether different from the crude linedrawing of the past. Old-time efforts, based on little more than guesses, sometimes led to so-called dummymanders—gerrymanders that went spectacularly wrong. Not likely in today’s world. Mapmakers now have access to more granular data about party preference and voting behavior than ever before. County-level voting data has given way to precinct-level or city-block-level data; and increasingly, mapmakers avail themselves of data sets providing wide-ranging information about even individual voters. Just as important, advancements in computing technology have enabled mapmakers to put that information to use with unprecedented efficiency and precision. While bygone mapmakers may have drafted three or four alternative districting plans, today’s mapmakers can generate thousands of possibilities at the touch of a key—and then choose the one giving their party maximum advantage (usually while still meeting traditional districting requirements). The effect is to make gerrymanders far more effective and durable than before, insulating politicians against all but the most titanic shifts in the political tides. These are not your grand-father’s—let alone the Framers’—gerrymanders.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb7b5cc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">C</p></div>
<p id="fb7b5cc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Partisan gerrymandering of the kind before us not only subverts democracy (as if that weren’t bad enough). It violates individuals’ constitutional rights as well. That statement is not the lonesome cry of a dissenting Justice. This Court has recognized extreme partisan gerrymandering as such a violation for many years.</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Partisan gerrymandering operates through vote dilution—the devaluation of one citizen’s vote as compared to others. A mapmaker draws district lines to “pack” and “crack” voters likely to support the disfavored party. He packs supermajorities of those voters into a relatively few districts, in numbers far greater than needed for their preferred candidates to prevail. Then he cracks the rest across many more districts, spreading them so thin that their candidates will not be able to win. Whether the person is packed or cracked, his vote carries less weight—has less consequence—than it would under a neutrally drawn (non-partisan) map. In short, the mapmaker has made some votes count for less, because they are likely to go for the other party.</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That practice implicates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The Fourteenth Amendment, we long ago recognized, “guarantees the opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the election” of legislators. And that opportunity “can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” Based on that principle, this Court in its one-person-one-vote decisions prohibited creating districts with significantly different populations. A State could not, we explained, thus “dilut[e] the weight of votes because of <span title="106" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-106">p. 106</span>place of residence.” The constitutional injury in a partisan gerrymandering case is much the same, except that the dilution is based on party affiliation. In such a case, too, the districters have set out to reduce the weight of certain citizens’ votes, and thereby deprive them of their capacity to “full[y] and effective[ly] participat[e] in the political process[ ].”</p>
<p id="fb7b5cc9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And partisan gerrymandering implicates the First Amendment too. That Amendment gives its greatest protection to political beliefs, speech, and association. Yet partisan gerrymanders subject certain voters to “disfavored treatment”—again, counting their votes for less—precisely because of “their voting history [and] their expression of political views.” And added to that strictly personal harm is an associational one. Representative democracy is “unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band together in [support of] candidates who espouse their political views.” By diluting the votes of certain citizens, the State frustrates their efforts to translate those affiliations into political effectiveness.</p>
<p id="fb7b5cca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though different Justices have described the constitutional harm in diverse ways, nearly all have agreed on this much: Extreme partisan gerrymandering (as happened in North Carolina and Maryland) violates the Constitution.</p>
</div>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fb7b5ccb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">II</p></div>
<p id="fb7b83dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the only way to understand the majority’s opinion is as follows: In the face of grievous harm to democratic governance and flagrant infringements on individuals’ rights—in the face of escalating partisan manipulation whose compatibility with this Nation’s values and law no one defends—the majority declines to provide any remedy. For the first time in this Nation’s history, the majority declares that it can do nothing about an acknowledged constitutional violation because it has searched high and low and cannot find a workable legal standard to apply.</p>
<p id="fb7b83dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority gives two reasons for thinking that the adjudication of partisan gerrymandering claims is beyond judicial capabilities. First and foremost, the majority says, it cannot find a neutral baseline—one not based on contestable notions of political fairness—from which to measure injury. According to the majority, “[p]artisan gerrymandering claims invariably sound in a desire for proportional representation.” But the Constitution does not mandate proportional representation. So, the majority contends, resolving those claims “inevitably” would require courts to decide what is “fair” in the context of districting. They would have “to make their own political judgment about how much representation particular political parties <i>deserve</i>” and “to rearrange the challenged districts to achieve that end.” And second, the majority argues that even after establishing a baseline, a court would have no way to answer “the determinative question: ‘How much is too much?’” No “discernible and manageable” standard is available, the majority claims—and so courts could willy-nilly become embroiled in fixing every districting plan.</p>
<p id="fb7b83de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I’ll give the majority this one—and important—thing: It identifies some dangers everyone should want to avoid. Judges should not be apportioning political power based on their own vision of electoral fairness, whether proportional representation or any other. And judges should not be striking down maps left, right, and center, on the view that every smidgen of politics is a smidgen too <span title="107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-107">p. 107</span>much. Respect for state legislative processes—and restraint in the exercise of judicial authority—counsels intervention in only egregious cases.</p>
<p id="fb7b83df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in throwing up its hands, the majority misses something under its nose: What it says can’t be done <i>has</i> been done. Over the past several years, federal courts across the country—including, but not exclusively, in the decisions below—have largely converged on a standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims (striking down both Democratic and Republican districting plans in the process). And that standard does what the majority says is impossible. The standard does not use any judge-made conception of electoral fairness—either proportional representation or any other; instead, it takes as its baseline a State’s <i>own</i> criteria of fairness, apart from partisan gain. And by requiring plaintiffs to make difficult showings relating to both purpose and effects, the standard invalidates the most extreme, but only the most extreme, partisan gerrymanders.</p>
<p id="fb7b83e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with the standard the lower courts used. Both courts focused on the harm of vote dilution. And both courts (like others around the country) used basically the same three-part test to decide whether the plaintiffs had made out a vote dilution claim. As many legal standards do, that test has three parts: (1) intent; (2) effects; and (3) causation. First, the plaintiffs challenging a districting plan must prove that state officials’ “predominant purpose” in drawing a district’s lines was to “entrench [their party] in power” by diluting the votes of citizens favoring its rival. Second, the plaintiffs must establish that the lines drawn in fact have the intended effect by “substantially” diluting their votes. And third, if the plaintiffs make those showings, the State must come up with a legitimate, non-partisan justification to save its map. If you are a lawyer, you know that this test looks utterly ordinary. It is the sort of thing courts work with every day.</p>
<p id="fb7b83e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s broadest claim, as I’ve noted, is that this is a price we must pay because judicial oversight of partisan gerrymandering cannot be “politically neutral” or “manageable.”</p>
<p id="fb7b83e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider neutrality first. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the District Courts did not have to—and in fact did not—choose among competing visions of electoral fairness. That is because they did not try to compare the State’s actual map to an “ideally fair” one (whether based on proportional representation or some other criterion). Instead, they looked at the difference between what the State did and what the State would have done if politicians hadn’t been intent on partisan gain.</p>
<p id="fb7b83e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s “how much is too much” critique fares no better than its neutrality argument. How about the following for a first-cut answer: This much is too much. By any measure, a map that produces a greater partisan skew than any of 3,000 randomly generated maps (all with the State’s political geography and districting criteria built in) reflects “too much” partisanship. Think about what I just said: The absolute worst of 3,001 possible maps. The <i>only one</i> that could produce a 10-3 partisan split even as Republicans got a bare majority of the statewide vote. And again: How much is too much? This much is too much: A map that without any evident non-partisan districting reason (to the contrary) shifted the composition of a district from 47% Republicans and 36% Democrats to 33% Republicans and 42% Democrats. A map that in 2011 was responsible for the largest partisan swing of a congressional district in the country. Even the majority acknowledges that “[t]hese cases involve blatant examples of partisanship driving districting decisions.” If the majority had done nothing else, <span title="108" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-108">p. 108</span>it could have set the line here. How much is too much? At the least, any gerrymanders as bad as these.</p>
<p id="fb7b83e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And if the majority thought that approach too case-specific, it could have used the lower courts’ general standard—focusing on “predominant” purpose and “substantial” effects—without fear of indeterminacy. I do not take even the majority to claim that courts are incapable of investigating whether legislators mainly intended to seek partisan advantage.</p>

<p id="fb7b83e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has long understood that it has a special responsibility to remedy violations of constitutional rights resulting from politicians’ districting decisions. Over 50 years ago, we committed to providing judicial review in that sphere, recognizing as we established the one-person-one-vote rule that “our oath and our office require no less.” Of course, our oath and our office require us to vindicate all constitutional rights. But the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in cases like these. “For here, politicians’ incentives conflict with voters’ interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms.” Those harms arise because politicians want to stay in office. No one can look to them for effective relief.</p>
<p id="fb7baaf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority disagrees, concluding its opinion with a paean to congressional bills limiting partisan gerrymanders. “Dozens of [those] bills have been introduced,” the majority says. One was “introduced in 2005 and has been reintroduced in every Congress since.” And might be reintroduced until the end of time. Because what all these <i>bills</i> have in common is that they are not <i>laws</i>. The politicians who benefit from partisan gerrymandering are unlikely to change partisan gerrymandering. And because those politicians maintain themselves in office through partisan gerrymandering, the chances for legislative reform are slight.</p>
<p id="fb7baaf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No worries, the majority says; it has another idea. The majority notes that voters themselves have recently approved ballot initiatives to put power over districting in the hands of independent commissions or other non-partisan actors. Fewer than half the States offer voters an opportunity to put initiatives to direct vote; in all the rest (including North Carolina and Maryland), voters are dependent on legislators to make electoral changes (which for all the reasons already given, they are unlikely to do). And even when voters have a mechanism they can work themselves, legislators often fight their efforts tooth and nail.</p>
<p id="fb7baaf9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s most perplexing “solution” is to look to state courts. But what do those courts know that this Court does not? If they can develop and apply neutral and manageable standards to identify unconstitutional gerrymanders, why couldn’t we?</p>
<p id="fb7baafa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We could have, and we should have. The gerrymanders here—and they are typical of many—violated the constitutional rights of many hundreds of thousands of American citizens. Those voters (Republicans in the one case, Democrats in the other) did not have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process. Their votes counted for far less than they should have because of their partisan affiliation. When faced with such constitutional wrongs, courts must intervene: “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</p>
<p id="fb7baafb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="109" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-109">p. 109</span>Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fb7bab05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 1966, petitioner Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was duly elected from the 18th Congressional District of New York to serve in the United States House of Representatives for the 90th Congress. However, pursuant to a House resolution, he was not permitted to take his seat. Powell (and some of the voters of his district) then filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the House could exclude him only if it found he failed to meet the standing requirements of age, citizenship, and residence contained in Art. I, §2, of the Constitution— requirements the House specifically found Powell met—and thus had excluded him unconstitutionally.</p>
<p id="fb7bab06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 89th Congress, a Special Subcommittee on Contracts of the Committee on House Administration conducted an investigation into the expenditures of the Committee on Education and Labor, of which petitioner Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was chairman. The Special Subcommittee issued a report concluding that Powell and certain staff employees had deceived the House authorities as to travel expenses. The report also indicated there was strong evidence that certain illegal salary payments had been made to Powell’s wife at his direction. No formal action was taken during the 89th Congress. However, prior to the organization of the 90th Congress, the Democratic members-elect met in caucus and voted to remove Powell as chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.</p>
<p id="fb7bd217-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the 90th Congress met to organize in January 1967, Powell was asked to step aside while the oath was administered to the other members-elect. [After a Committee investigation and report, the House voted to exclude Powell and directed that the Speaker notify the Governor of New York that the seat was vacant.]</p>

<p id="fb7bd219-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ first contention is that this case presents a political question because under Art. I, §5, there has been a “textually demonstrable constitutional commitment” to the House of the “adjudicatory power” to determine Powell’s qualifications. Thus it is argued that the House, and the House alone, has power to determine who is qualified to be a member.</p>
<p id="fb7bd21a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to determine whether there has been a textual commitment to a coordinate department of the Government, we must interpret the Constitution. In other words, we must first determine what power the Constitution confers upon the House through Art. I, §5, before we can determine to what extent, if any, the exercise of that power is subject to judicial review. Respondents maintain that the House has broad power under §5, and, they argue, the House may determine which are the qualifications necessary for membership. On the other hand, petitioners allege that the Constitution provides that an elected representative may be denied his seat only if the House finds he does not meet one of the standing qualifications expressly prescribed by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb7bd21b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to determine the scope of any “textual commitment” under Art. I, §5, we necessarily must determine the meaning of the phrase to “be the Judge of the Qualifications of its own Members.” Petitioners argue that the records of the debates during the Constitutional Convention; available commentary from the post-Convention, pre-ratification period; and early congressional applications of Art. I, §5, support their construction of the section. Our examination of the relevant historical materials leads us to the conclusion that petitioners are correct and that the Constitution leaves the House without authority to exclude any person, duly elected by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb7bd21c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After reviewing English history, debates at the Constitutional Convention, and subsequent practices, the Court concluded:] Had the intent of the framers emerged from these materials with less clarity, we would nevertheless have been compelled to resolve any ambiguity in favor of a narrow construction of the scope of Congress’ power to exclude members-elect. A fundamental principle of our representative democracy is, in Hamilton’s words, “that the people should choose whom they please to govern them.” As Madison pointed out at the Convention, this principle is undermined as much by limiting whom the people can select as by limiting the franchise itself. In apparent agreement with this basic philosophy, the Convention adopted his suggestion limiting the power to expel. To allow essentially that same power to be exercised under the guise of judging qualifications, would be to ignore Madison’s warning, borne out in the Wilkes case and some of Congress’s own post–Civil War exclusion cases, against “vesting an improper &amp; dangerous power in the Legislature.” Moreover, it would effectively nullify the Convention’s decision to require a two-thirds vote for expulsion. Unquestionably, Congress has an interest in preserving its institutional integrity, but in most cases that interest can be sufficiently safeguarded by the exercise of its power to punish its members for disorderly behavior and, in extreme cases, to expel a member with the concurrence of two-thirds. In short, both the intention of the framers, to the extent it can be determined, and an examination of the basic principles of our democratic system persuade us that the Constitution does not vest in the Congress a discretionary power to deny membership by a majority vote.</p>

I, §5, is at most a “textually demonstrable commitment” to Congress to judge only the qualifications expressly set forth in the Constitution. Therefore, the “textual commitment” formulation of the political question doctrine does not bar federal courts from adjudicating petitioners’ claims.</p>

<p id="fb7bf941-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am of the view that the basic question presented by the petitioners in this case is “political” and therefore nonjusticiable because it involves the authority of the President in the conduct of our country’s foreign relations and the extent to which the Senate or the Congress is authorized to negate the action of the President.</p>

<p id="fb7c2053-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the absence of any constitutional provision governing the termination of a treaty, and the fact that different termination procedures may be appropriate for different treaties, the instant case in my view also “must surely be controlled by political standards.”</p>

This Court has recognized that an issue should not be decided if it is not ripe for judicial review. Prudential considerations persuade me that a dispute between Congress and the President is not ready for judicial review unless and until each branch has taken action asserting its constitutional authority. Differences between the President and the Congress are commonplace under our system. The differences should, and almost invariably do, turn on political rather than legal considerations. The Judicial Branch should not decide issues affecting the allocation of power between the President and Congress until the political branches reach a constitutional impasse. Otherwise, we would encourage small groups or even individual Members of Congress to seek judicial <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>resolution of issues before the normal political process has the opportunity to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p id="fb7c2058-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, a few Members of Congress claim that the President’s action in terminating the treaty with Taiwan has deprived them of their constitutional role with respect to a change in the supreme law of the land. Congress has taken no official action. In the present posture of this case, we do not know whether there ever will be an actual confrontation between the Legislative and Executive Branches. Although the Senate has considered a resolution declaring that Senate approval is necessary for the termination of any mutual defense treaty, no final vote has been taken on the resolution. Moreover, it is unclear whether the resolution would have retroactive effect. It cannot be said that either the Senate or the House has rejected the President’s claim. If the Congress chooses not to confront the President, it is not our task to do so. I therefore concur in the dismissal of this case.</p>
<p id="fb7c2059-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Rehnquist suggests, however, that the issue presented by this case is a nonjusticiable political question which can never be considered by this Court. I cannot agree. In my view, reliance upon the political-question doctrine is inconsistent with our precedents. As set forth in the seminal case of Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the doctrine incorporates three inquiries: (i) Does the issue involve resolution of questions committed by the text of the Constitution to a coordinate branch of Government? (ii) Would resolution of the question demand that a court move beyond areas of judicial expertise? (iii) Do prudential considerations counsel against judicial intervention? In my opinion the answer to each of these inquiries would require us to decide this case if it were ready for review.</p>
<p id="fb7c205a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the existence of “a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department,” turns on an examination of the constitutional provisions governing the exercise of the power in question. No constitutional provision explicitly confers upon the President the power to terminate treaties. Further, Art. II, §2, of the Constitution authorizes the President to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. Article VI provides that treaties shall be a part of the supreme law of the land. These provisions add support to the view that the text of the Constitution does not unquestionably commit the power to terminate treaties to the President alone.</p>
<p id="fb7c205b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, there is no “lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving” this case; nor is a decision impossible “without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.” We are asked to decide whether the President may terminate a treaty under the Constitution without congressional approval. Resolution of the question may not be easy, but it only requires us to apply normal principles of interpretation to the constitutional provisions at issue. The present case involves neither review of the President’s activities as Commander in Chief nor impermissible interference in the field of foreign affairs. Such a case would arise if we were asked to decide, for example, whether a treaty required the President to order troops into a foreign country. But “it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.” Baker v. Carr.</p>
<p id="fb7c205c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the political-question doctrine rests in part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect among the three branches of Government. Thus, the Judicial Branch should avoid “the potentiality of embarrassment [that would <span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-114">p. 114</span>result] from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.” Similarly, the doctrine restrains judicial action where there is an “unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.”</p>
<p id="fb7c205d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the suggestion that this case presents a political question is incompatible with this Court’s willingness on previous occasions to decide whether one branch of our Government has impinged upon the power of another. Under the criteria enunciated in Baker v. Carr, we have the responsibility to decide whether both the Executive and Legislative Branches have constitutional roles to play in termination of a treaty. If the Congress, by appropriate formal action, had challenged the President’s authority to terminate the treaty with Taiwan, the resulting uncertainty could have serious consequences for our country. In that situation, it would be the duty of this Court to resolve the issue.</p>

<p id="fb7c4774-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress enacted a statute providing that Americans born in Jerusalem may elect to have “Israel” listed as the place of birth on their passports. The State Department declined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of not taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem. When sued by an American who invoked the statute, the Secretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority to decide the case because it presented a political question. The Court of Appeals so held.</p>
<p id="fb7c4775-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determining whether this statute may be given effect, or instead must be struck down in light of authority conferred on the Executive by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fb7c4776-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it, even those it “would gladly avoid.” Our precedents have identified a narrow exception to that rule, known as the “political question” doctrine.</p>
<p id="fb7c4777-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political question because deciding Zivotofsky’s claim would force the Judicial Branch to interfere with the President’s exercise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The District Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to “decide the political status of Jerusalem.” This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivotofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to determine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under §214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport as his place of birth.</p>
<p id="fb7c4778-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal courts are not being asked to supplant a foreign policy decision of the political branches with the courts’ own unmoored determination of what United States policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory right. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if Zivotofsky’s interpretation of the statute is correct, and whether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar judicial exercise.</p>
<p id="fb7c6e89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of §214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional. At least since Marbury v. Madison, we have recognized that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, “[i]t is emphatically the <span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-115">p. 115</span>province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” That duty will sometimes involve the “[r]esolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches,” but courts cannot avoid their responsibility merely “because the issues have political implications.”</p>
<p id="fb7c6e8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, determining the constitutionality of §214(d) involves deciding whether the statute impermissibly intrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution. If so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky’s case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the other hand, the statute does not trench on the President’s powers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivotofsky a passport that complies with §214(d). Either way, the political question doctrine is not implicated. “No policy underlying the political question doctrine suggests that Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitutionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.”</p>

<p id="fb7c6e8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four sets of prudential considerations, <i>taken together</i>, lead me to the conclusion [that this case poses a political question]:</p>
<p id="fb7c6e8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign affairs. Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional question before us, they may well have to evaluate the foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial resolution of the constitutional determination are not particularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the kind of interest, <i>e.g.</i>, an interest in property or bodily integrity, which courts have traditionally sought to protect. Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different foreign policy views among the political branches of Government, those branches have nonjudicial methods of working out their differences. The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its minimal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious risk that intervention will bring about “embarrassment,” show lack of “respect” for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For these prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-question doctrine bars further judicial consideration of this case.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114F9_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N114F9_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">50</a></span></p>

<p id="fb7c94a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Walter L. Nixon, Jr., asks this Court to decide whether Senate Rule XI, which allows a committee of Senators to hear evidence against an individual who has been impeached and to report that evidence to the full Senate, violates the Impeachment Trial Clause, Art. I, §3, cl. 6. That Clause provides that the “Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” But before we reach the merits of such a claim, we must decide whether it is “justiciable,” that is, whether it is a claim that may be resolved by the courts. We conclude that it is not.</p>
<p id="fb7c94aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nixon, a former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, was convicted by a jury of two counts of making false statements before a federal grand jury and sentenced to prison. The grand jury investigation stemmed from reports that Nixon had accepted a gratuity from a Mississippi businessman in exchange for asking a local district attorney to halt the prosecution of the businessman’s son. Because Nixon refused to resign from his office as a United States District Judge, he continued to collect his judicial salary while serving out his prison sentence.</p>
<p id="fb7c94ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 10, 1989, the House of Representatives adopted three articles of impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors. The first two articles charged Nixon with giving false testimony before the grand jury and the third article charged him with bringing disrepute on the Federal Judiciary.</p>
<p id="fb7c94ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the House presented the articles to the Senate, the Senate voted to invoke its own Impeachment Rule XI, under which the presiding officer appoints a committee of Senators to “receive evidence and take testimony.” Senate Impeachment Rule XI. The Senate committee held four days of hearings, during which 10 witnesses, including Nixon, testified. Pursuant to Rule XI, the committee presented the full Senate with a complete transcript of the proceeding and a Report stating the uncontested facts and summarizing the evidence on the contested facts. Nixon and the House impeachment managers submitted extensive final briefs to the full Senate and delivered arguments from the Senate floor during the three hours set aside for oral argument in front of that body. Nixon himself gave a personal appeal, and several Senators posed questions directly to both parties. The Senate voted by more than the constitutionally required two-thirds majority to convict Nixon on the first two articles. The presiding officer then entered judgment removing Nixon from his office as United States District Judge.</p>
<p id="fb7c94ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nixon thereafter commenced the present suit, arguing that Senate Rule XI violates the constitutional grant of authority to the Senate to “try” all impeachments because it prohibits the whole Senate from taking part in the evidentiary hearings. See Art. I, §3, cl. 6. Nixon sought a declaratory judgment that his impeachment conviction was void and that his judicial salary and privileges should be reinstated.</p>
<p id="fb7c94ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, we must examine Art. I, §3, cl. 6, to determine the scope of authority conferred upon the Senate by the framers regarding impeachment. It provides:</p><span title="117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-117">p. 117</span>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fb7c94af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.</p>
</div>
<p id="fb7c94b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language and structure of this Clause are revealing. The first sentence is a grant of authority to the Senate, and the word “sole” indicates that this authority is reposed in the Senate and nowhere else. The next two sentences specify requirements to which the Senate proceedings shall conform: The Senate shall be on oath or affirmation, a two-thirds vote is required to convict, and when the President is tried the Chief Justice shall preside.</p>
<p id="fb7c94b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that the word “sole” is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word “sole” appears only one other time in the Constitution—with respect to the House of Representatives’ “sole Power of Impeachment.” Art. I, §2, cl. 5. The common-sense meaning of the word “sole” is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted. If the courts may review the actions of the Senate in order to determine whether that body “tried” an impeached official, it is difficult to see how the Senate would be “functioning . . . independently and without assistance or interference.”</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two additional reasons why the Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments. First, the framers recognized that most likely there would be two sets of proceedings for individuals who commit impeachable offenses—the impeachment trial and a separate criminal trial. In fact, the Constitution explicitly provides for two separate proceedings. See Art. I, §3, cl. 7. The framers deliberately separated the two forums to avoid raising the specter of bias and to ensure independent judgments. Certainly judicial review of the Senate’s “trial” would introduce the same risk of bias as would participation in the trial itself.</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, judicial review would be inconsistent with the framers’ insistence that our system be one of checks and balances. In our constitutional system, impeachment was designed to be the only check on the Judicial Branch by the Legislature. Judicial involvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the “important constitutional check” placed on the Judiciary by the framers. Nixon’s argument would place final reviewing authority with respect to impeachments in the hands of the same body that the impeachment process is meant to regulate.</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, Nixon argues that judicial review is necessary in order to place a check on the Legislature. Nixon fears that if the Senate is given unreviewable authority to interpret the Impeachment Trial Clause, there is a grave risk that the Senate will usurp judicial power. The framers anticipated this objection and created two constitutional safeguards to keep the Senate in check. The first safeguard is that the whole of the impeachment power is divided between the two legislative bodies, with the House given the right to accuse and the Senate given the right to judge. The second safeguard is the two-thirds supermajority vote requirement. Hamilton explained that “[a]s the concurrence of two-thirds of the senate will be requisite to a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this additional circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.”</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the textual commitment argument, we are persuaded that the lack of finality and the difficulty of fashioning relief counsel against justiciability. <span title="118" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-118">p. 118</span>We agree with the Court of Appeals that opening the door of judicial review to the procedures used by the Senate in trying impeachments would “expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of chaos.” This lack of finality would manifest itself most dramatically if the President were impeached. The legitimacy of any successor, and hence his effectiveness, would be impaired severely, not merely while the judicial process was running its course, but during any retrial that a differently constituted Senate might conduct if its first judgment of conviction were invalidated. Equally uncertain is the question of what relief a court may give other than simply setting aside the judgment of conviction. Could it order the reinstatement of a convicted federal judge, or order Congress to create an additional judgeship if the seat had been filled in the interim?</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that this case presents a nonjusticiable political question. Because my analysis differs somewhat from the Court’s, however, I concur in its judgment by this separate opinion.</p>
<p id="fb7cbbc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Court observes, judicial review of an impeachment trial would under the best of circumstances entail significant disruption of government. One can, nevertheless, envision different and unusual circumstances that might justify a more searching review of impeachment proceedings. If the Senate were to act in a manner seriously threatening the integrity of its results, convicting, say, upon a coin toss, or upon a summary determination that an officer of the United States was simply “a bad guy,” judicial interference might well be appropriate. In such circumstances, the Senate’s action might be so far beyond the scope of its constitutional authority, and the consequent impact on the Republic so great, as to merit a judicial response despite the prudential concerns that would ordinarily counsel silence. “The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.”</p>

One of the most important is the Eleventh Amendment which has been interpreted as barring suits against states in federal court by states’ own citizens and citizens of other states. The complex body of Eleventh Amendment law generally is covered in Federal Courts classes and not Constitutional Law courses and so is beyond the scope of this book. However, the Court has had occasion to discuss the Eleventh Amendment in considering the scope of Congress’s powers under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. These cases are presented in Chapter 2.

Cases such as this, in which the relief requested goes well beyond the violation of law alleged, illustrate why it is important to keep the inquiries separate if the “redressability” component is to focus on the requested relief. Even if the relief respondents request might have a substantial effect on the desegregation of public schools, whatever deficiencies exist in the opportunities for desegregated education for respondents’ children might not be traceable to IRS violations of law—grants of tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools in respondents’ communities.

This requirement applies when a person is challenging an administrative agency regulation that does not directly control the person’s actions. The Supreme Court has stated that the plaintiff must allege that “the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.” Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970). In other words, if a plaintiff is suing pursuant to a statutory provision, in order to have standing the plaintiff must be part of the group intended to benefit from the law. Although the Court’s statement of the test includes its application to constitutional provisions, the zone of interests requirement is used only in statutory cases, usually involving administrative law issues.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fb773dee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10C48_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N10C48_ef80dd89-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span>&nbsp;Warth v.
