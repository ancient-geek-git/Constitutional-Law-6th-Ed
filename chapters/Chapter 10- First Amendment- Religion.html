<p id="fc634b4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment begins with the words “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” These two clauses are commonly referred to, respectively, as the “Establishment Clause” and the “Free Exercise Clause.” The Free Exercise Clause was first applied to the states through its incorporation into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940). The Establishment Clause was first found to be incorporated and applied to the states in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10031_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10031_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> The incorporation of the Establishment Clause is more controversial than the incorporation of the Free Exercise Clause because the latter clearly safeguards individual liberty while the former seems directed at the government. The Supreme Court, however, has explained that the Establishment Clause, too, protects liberty. Justice Brennan, concurring in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), explained that “the Establishment Clause [is] a co-guarantor, with the Free Exercise Clause, of religious liberty. The framers did not entrust the liberty of religious beliefs to either clause alone.” As the Court declared in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992), “A state-created orthodoxy puts at grave risk that freedom of belief and conscience which are the sole assurance that religious faith is real, not imposed.”</p>
<p id="fc634b4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1666" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1666">p. 1666</span>To a large extent, the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses are complementary. Both protect freedom of religious belief and actions. Many government actions would simultaneously violate both of these provisions. For example, if the state were to create a religion and compel participation, it obviously would be establishing religion and, at the same time, denying free exercise to those who did not want to participate in religion or who wished to choose a different faith. Mandatory school prayers likewise involve both the government establishing religion and interfering with free exercise of religious beliefs for those who do not believe in the prayers. In a recent case, presented below, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171 (2012), the Court held that it violated both the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses to hold a religious institution liable for discrimination in the choices it makes as to who will be its ministers. The case involved a religious elementary school where many of the teachers were designated as ministers. A teacher who lost her job after an illness and then was fired sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Court unanimously ruled that it would infringe both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause to hold a religious institution liable for the choices it makes as to who will be its ministers.</p>
<p id="fc634b4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet there also is often tension between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Government actions to facilitate free exercise might be challenged as impermissible establishments, and government efforts to refrain from establishing religion might be objected to as denying the free exercise of religion. For instance, if the government pays for and provides ministers for those in the armed services, it arguably is establishing religion, but if the government refuses to do so on these grounds, it arguably is denying free exercise of religion.</p>
<p id="fc634b4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the primary test used for the Establishment Clause—articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), and reviewed in detail below in section C—makes this tension inevitable. Under the <i>Lemon</i> test, the government violates the Establishment Clause if the government’s primary purpose is to advance religion, or if the principal effect is to aid or inhibit religion, or if there is excessive government entanglement with religion. Yet any time the government acts to protect free exercise of religion, its primary purpose is to advance religion; any time the principal effect is to facilitate free exercise, the government is aiding religion. For example, if the government creates an exemption to a law solely for religion, it arguably violates the Establishment Clause; if the government fails to create such an exemption for religion, it arguably infringes free exercise.</p>
<p id="fc634b4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has recognized that this tension is inherent in the First Amendment and has noted the difficulty of finding “a neutral course between the two Religion Clauses, both of which are cast in absolute terms, and either of which, if expanded to a logical extreme, would tend to clash with the other.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> Additionally, there is a tension between the First Amendment’s protection of speech and its prohibition against establishment of religion. For example, allowing government financial aid to student <span title="1667" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1667">p. 1667</span>religious groups<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10053_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10053_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> or permitting religious groups to use school facilities<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1005B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1005B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> arguably violates the Establishment Clause; but denying funds or facilities because of the religious content of the expression seems to infringe the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech. This tension between the Establishment Clause and freedom of speech is discussed below.</p>

<p id="fc634b55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with all constitutional provisions, some look to history as a guide to the meaning of the Religion Clauses. This is particularly difficult for these provisions because there is no apparent agreement among the framers as to what they meant. Justice Brennan expressed this well when he stated: “A too literal quest for the advice of the Founding Fathers upon the issues of these cases seems to me futile and misdirected for several reasons. . . . [T]he historical record is at best ambiguous, and statements can readily be found to support either side of the proposition.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10073_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10073_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span> Yet justices on all sides of the issue continue to invoke history and the original understanding of that text to support their position. Chief Justice Rehnquist has remarked that “[t]he true meaning of Establishment Clause can only be seen in its history.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10079_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10079_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span> In Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), which concerned whether a public university could deny student activity funds to a religious group, both Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, and Justice Souter, dissenting, focused at length on James Madison’s views of religious freedom.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1007F_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1007F_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span></p>
<p id="fc637269-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Professor Laurence Tribe has cogently summarized, there were at least three main views of religion among key framers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1008E_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1008E_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span></p>

<p id="fc63726b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]t least three distinct schools of thought . . . influenced the drafters of the Bill of Rights: first, the evangelical view (associated primarily with Roger Williams) that “worldly corruptions . . . might consume the churches if sturdy fences against the wilderness were not maintained”; second, the Jeffersonian view that the church should be walled off from the state in order to safeguard secular interests (public and private) “against ecclesiastical depredations and incursions”; and, third, the Madisonian view that religious and secular interests alike would be advanced best by diffusing and decentralizing power so as to assure competition among sects rather than dominance by any one.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1009C_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1009C_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span></p>
</div>
<p id="fc63726d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are quite distinct views of the proper relationship between religion and the government. Roger Williams was primarily concerned that government involvement with religion would corrupt and undermine religion, whereas Thomas Jefferson had the opposite fear that religion would corrupt and undermine the government. James Madison saw religion as one among many types of <span title="1668" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1668">p. 1668</span>factions that existed. He wrote that “[i]n a free government the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and the other in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100AA_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100AA_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span></p>
<p id="fc63726f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem of using history in interpreting the Religion Clauses is compounded by the enormous changes in the country since the First Amendment was adopted. The country is much more religiously diverse today than it was in 1791. Justice Brennan observed that “our religious composition makes us a vastly more diverse people than were our forefathers. They knew differences chiefly among Protestant sects. Today the nation is far more heterogeneous religiously, including as it does substantial minorities not only of Catholics and Jews but as well of those who worship according to no version of the Bible and those who worship no God at all.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100B6_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100B6_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span></p>
<p id="fc637271-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, as discussed below, a significant number of cases involving the Establishment Clause have arisen in the context of religious activities in connection with schools. But public education, as it exists now, did not exist when the Bill of Rights was ratified, and it is inherently difficult to apply the framers’ views to situations that they could not have imagined. Justice Brennan remarked that “the structure of American education has greatly changed since the First Amendment was adopted. In the context of our modern emphasis upon public education available to all citizens, any views of the eighteenth century as to whether the exercises at bar are an ‘establishment’ offer little aid to decision.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100BF_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100BF_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span></p>
<p id="fc637273-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, debates about history and the framers’ intent are likely to remain a key aspect of decisions concerning the Religion Clauses. Members of the Supreme Court who follow an originalist philosophy of constitutional interpretation believe that the Constitution’s meaning is to be ascertained solely from its text and from its framers’ intent. Also, the divergence of views among the framers, and the abstractness with which they are stated, makes it possible for those on all sides of the debate to invoke history in support of their positions.</p>

<p id="fc637276-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under both the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses, the issue can arise as to what is “religion.” Yet, not surprisingly, the Court has avoided trying to formulate a definition. It seems impossible to formulate a definition of religion that encompasses the vast array of spiritual beliefs and practices that are present in the United States. As one commentator noted, “[T]here is no single characteristic or set of characteristics that all religions have in common that makes them religions.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100D7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100D7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span> Moreover, any attempt to define religion raises concern that choosing a single definition is itself an establishment of religion.</p>
<p id="fc637278-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, there is a desire for a broad definition of religion for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause so as to maximize protection for religious conduct but a narrow definition of religion for Establishment Clause analysis so as to limit the constraints on government.</p>
<p id="fc637279-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1669" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1669">p. 1669</span>Although some commentators have argued for separate definitions of religion for the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses, the Supreme Court never has accepted this position. In fact, Justice Rutledge expressly rejected this approach in his opinion in Everson v. Board of Education: “‘Religion’ appears only once in the Amendment. But the word governs two prohibitions and governs them alike. It does not have two meanings, one narrow to forbid ‘an establishment’ and another, much broader, for ‘securing’ the free exercise thereof.”</p>
<p id="fc63998a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the Supreme Court never has formulated a definition of religion, it has considered the issue in three contexts. First, in cases under the Selective Service Act, the Court struggled to define religion for purposes of the conscientious objector exemption. Second, the Court has said that a court can inquire as to whether a religious belief is sincerely held in deciding whether it is protected under the Constitution. Finally, the Court has made it clear that an individual’s sincerely held religious belief is protected by the First Amendment even if it is not the dogma or dominant view within the religion. Each of these concepts is discussed in turn.</p>

<p id="fc63998d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary effort by the Supreme Court to define religion has not been in First Amendment cases, but rather in decisions concerning the scope of a religious exemption to the Selective Service Act, which authorized the military draft. In other words, these cases involved statutory construction, rather than constitutional interpretation. Yet these cases are important as the only decisions to attempt to define religion.</p>

<p id="fc639993-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Clark</span> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="fc639994-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases involve claims of conscientious objectors under §6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, which exempts from combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States those persons who by reason of their religious training and belief are conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. The parties raise the basic question of the constitutionality of the section which defines the term “religious training and belief,” as used in the Act, as “an individual’s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but (not including) essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.”</p>
<p id="fc639995-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seeger was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of New York of having refused to submit to induction in the armed forces. He was originally classified 1-A in 1953 by his local board, but this classification was changed in 1955 to 2-S (student) and he remained in this status until 1958 when he was reclassified 1-A. He first claimed exemption as a conscientious objector in 1957 after successive annual renewals of his student classification. Although he did not <span title="1670" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1670">p. 1670</span>adopt verbatim the printed Selective Service System form, he declared that he was conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form by reason of his “religious” belief; that he preferred to leave the question as to his belief in a Supreme Being open, “rather than answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’”; that his “skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God” did “not necessarily mean lack of faith in anything whatsoever”; that his was a “belief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed.” He cited such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza for support of his ethical belief in intellectual and moral integrity “without belief in God, except in the remotest sense.”</p>
<p id="fc639996-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">His belief was found to be sincere, honest, and made in good faith; and his conscientious objection to be based upon individual training and belief, both of which included research in religious and cultural fields. Seeger’s claim, however, was denied solely because it was not based upon a “belief in a relation to a Supreme Being” as required by §6(j) of the Act.</p>
<p id="fc639997-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Few would quarrel, we think, with the proposition that in no field of human endeavor has the tool of language proved so inadequate in the communication of ideas as it has in dealing with the fundamental questions of man’s predicament in life, in death or in final judgment and retribution. This fact makes the task of discerning the intent of Congress in using the phrase “Supreme Being” a complex one. Nor is it made the easier by the richness and variety of spiritual life in our country. Over 250 sects inhabit our land. Some believe in a purely personal God, some in a supernatural deity; others think of religion as a way of life envisioning as its ultimate goal the day when all men can live together in perfect understanding and peace. There are those who think of God as the depth of our being; others, such as the Buddhists, strive for a state of lasting rest through self-denial and inner purification; in Hindu philosophy, the Supreme Being is the transcendental reality which is truth, knowledge and bliss. Even those religious groups which have traditionally opposed war in every form have splintered into various denominations. This vast panoply of beliefs reveals the magnitude of the problem which faced the Congress when it set about providing an exemption from armed service. It also emphasizes the care that Congress realized was necessary in the fashioning of an exemption which would be in keeping with its long-established policy of not picking and choosing among religious beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc639998-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression “Supreme Being” rather than the designation “God,” was merely clarifying the meaning of religious training and belief so as to embrace all religions and to exclude essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views. We believe that under this construction, the test of belief “in a relation to a Supreme Being” is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is “in a relation to Supreme Being” and the other is not. We have concluded that the beliefs of the objectors in these cases meet these criteria.</p>

<p id="fc639999-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Seeger</i>, however, offered no criteria for assessing whether a particular view is religious under this definition. Nor did the Court do so in the subsequent case of Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970). <i>Welsh</i>, like <i>Seeger</i>, <span title="1671" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1671">p. 1671</span>involved a person seeking an exemption from the draft on religious grounds. Welsh actually crossed out the words “religious training” on his form. The plurality opinion by Justice Black said that his situation was indistinguishable from Seeger’s: “[B]oth Seeger and Welsh affirmed on those applications that they held deep conscientious scruples against taking part in wars where people were killed. Both strongly believed that killing in war was wrong, unethical, and immoral, and their consciences forbade them to take part in such an evil practice.” Again, the Court said that the crucial inquiry “in determining whether the registrant’s beliefs are religious is whether these beliefs play the role of a religion and function as a religion in the registrant’s life.”</p>
<p id="fc63999a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality explained that belief in God is characteristic of most religions, but not a prerequisite for religion. Justice Black wrote, “Most of the great religions of today and of the past have embodied the idea of a Supreme Being or a Supreme Reality—a God—who communicates to man in some way a consciousness of what is right and should be done, of what is wrong and therefore should be shunned. If an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual ‘a place parallel to that filled by . . . God’ in traditionally religious persons.” The Court concluded that the statute “exempts from military service all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war.” The Court concluded that Welsh’s moral opposition to war fit within this definition of religion.</p>
<p id="fc63999b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Seeger</i> and <i>Welsh</i> involved the Court’s interpreting a statutory provision and not the First Amendment, they likely would be the starting points for any cases that required the Court to define religion under the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. On the one hand, these cases can be praised for broadening the definition of religion to include nontheistic views. Many religions reject the idea of a Supreme Being, and <i>Seeger</i> and <i>Welsh</i> adopt an approach that allows these faiths to be protected by the First Amendment. Moreover, the broad definitions employed allow moral judgments to be protected whether they are based on religion or philosophy. This is desirable because it does not give special status to religious moral judgments over secular ones and thereby avoids an Establishment Clause problem.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1015D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1015D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span></p>
<p id="fc63999d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On other hand, these cases can be criticized because of the lack of guidance they provide in defining what is a religious belief. A judge in a future case has little guidance in deciding what is a belief that is “sincere and meaningful [and] occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption.”</p>

<p id="fc63c0b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The need to define “religion” might arise in the context of an individual who is seeking an exemption from a law because of views that he or she terms <span title="1672" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1672">p. 1672</span>religious. How is a court to decide if they are “religious” beliefs? The Supreme Court has indicated that the judiciary can determine only whether they are sincerely held views, not whether they are true or false. The court drew this distinction in United States v. Ballard.</p>

<p id="fc63c0b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc63c0b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents were indicted and convicted for using, and conspiring to use, the mails to defraud. The indictment was in twelve counts. It charged a scheme to defraud by organizing and promoting the I Am movement through the use of the mails. The charge was that certain designated corporations were formed, literature distributed and sold, funds solicited, and memberships in the I Am movement sought “by means of false and fraudulent representations, pretenses and promises.” It is sufficient at this point to say that they covered respondents’ alleged religious doctrines or beliefs. [The indictment charged] “that Guy W. Ballard, during his lifetime, and Edna W. Ballard and Donald Ballard had, by reason of supernatural attainments, the power to heal persons of ailments and diseases and to make well persons afflicted with any diseases, injuries, or ailments, and did falsely represent to persons intended to be defrauded that the three designated persons had the ability and power to cure persons of those diseases normally classified as curable and also of diseases which are ordinarily classified by the medical profession as being incurable diseases; and did further represent that the three designated persons had in fact cured either by the activity of one, either, or all of said persons, hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments.” Each of the representations enumerated in the indictment was followed by the charge that respondents “well knew” it was false.</p>
<p id="fc63c0b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e do not agree that the truth or verity of respondents’ religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Whatever this particular indictment might require, the First Amendment precludes such a course, as the United States seems to concede. “The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.” The First Amendment has a dual aspect. It not only “forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship” but also “safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion.”</p>
<p id="fc63c0b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts—freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Freedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men. It embraces the right to maintain theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to followers of the orthodox faiths. Heresy trials are foreign to our Constitution. Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others. Yet the fact that they may be beyond the ken of mortals does not mean that they can be made suspect before the law.</p>
<p id="fc63c0ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many take their gospel from <span title="1673" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1673">p. 1673</span>the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining whether those teachings contained false representations. The miracles of the New Testament, the Divinity of Christ, life after death, the power of prayer are deep in the religious convictions of many. If one could be sent to jail because a jury in a hostile environment found those teachings false, little indeed would be left of religious freedom. The Fathers of the Constitution were not unaware of the varied and extreme views of religious sects, of the violence of disagreement among them, and of the lack of any one religious creed on which all men would agree. They fashioned a charter of government which envisaged the widest possible toleration of conflicting views. Man’s relation to his God was made no concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views.</p>
<p id="fc63c0bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The religious views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religion for preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position. So we conclude that the District Court ruled properly when it withheld from the jury all questions concerning the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs or doctrines of respondents.</p>
<p id="fc63c0bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Jackson</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc63c0bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I should say the defendants have done just that for which they are indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do so. I can see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.</p>
<p id="fc63c0be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ballard family claimed miraculous communication with the spirit world and supernatural power to heal the sick. They were brought to trial for mail fraud on an indictment which charged that their representations were false and that they “well knew” they were false. The trial judge, obviously troubled, ruled that the court could not try whether the statements were untrue, but could inquire whether the defendants knew them to be untrue; and, if so, they could be convicted.</p>
<p id="fc63c0bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I find it difficult to reconcile this conclusion with our traditional religious freedoms. In the first place, as a matter of either practice or philosophy I do not see how we can separate an issue as to what is believed from considerations as to what is believable. The most convincing proof that one believes his statements is to show that they have been true in his experience.</p>
<p id="fc63c0c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, that one knowingly falsified is best proved by showing that what he said happened never did happen. How can the Government prove these persons knew something to be false which it cannot prove to be false? If we try religious sincerity severed from religious verity, we isolate the dispute from the very considerations which in common experience provide its most reliable answer.</p>
<p id="fc63c0c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second place, any inquiry into intellectual honesty in religion raises profound psychological problems. William James, who wrote on these matters as a scientist, reminds us that it is not theology and ceremonies which keep religion going. Its vitality is in the religious experiences of many people. “If you ask what these experiences are, they are conversations with the unseen, voices and visions, responses to prayer, changes of heart, deliverances from fear, inflowings <span title="1674" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1674">p. 1674</span>of help, assurances of support, whenever certain persons set their own internal attitude in certain appropriate ways.” If religious liberty includes, as it must, the right to communicate such experiences to others, it seems to me an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand and are almost certain not to believe him.</p>
<p id="fc63c0c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There appear to be persons—let us hope not many—who find refreshment and courage in the teachings of the “I Am” cult. If the members of the sect get comfort from the celestial guidance of their “Saint Germain,” however doubtful it seems to me, it is hard to say that they do not get what they pay for. Scores of sects flourish in this country by teaching what to me are queer notions. It is plain that there is wide variety in American religious taste. The Ballards are not alone in catering to it with a pretty dubious product.</p>
<p id="fc63c0c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosecutions of this character easily could degenerate into religious persecution. I do not doubt that religious leaders may be convicted of fraud for making false representations on matters other than faith or experience, as for example if one represents that funds are being used to construct a church when in fact they are being used for personal purposes. But that is not this case, which reaches into wholly dangerous ground. When does less than full belief in a professed credo become actionable fraud if one is soliciting gifts or legacies? Such inquiries may discomfort orthodox as well as unconventional religious teachers, for even the most regular of them are sometimes accused of taking their orthodoxy with a grain of salt.</p>
<p id="fc63c0c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would dismiss the indictment and have done with this business of judicial examining other people’s faiths.</p>

<p id="fc63e7d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One way to assess the sincerity of a religious belief is with reference to the prevailing doctrines, if any, of that religion. In other words, what do others of that faith think with regard to the particular question? The problem, however, is that religion is inherently personal, as well as often group-based, and an individual may have a sincere religious belief that departs from the dogma of his or her religion. In fact, for this reason, the Court has said that the dominant views in a faith are not determinative in assessing whether a particular belief is religious.</p>
<p id="fc63e7d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707 (1981), the Court ruled that an individual could claim a religious belief even though it was inconsistent with the doctrines of his or her religion. A person who was a member of Jehovah’s Witnesses quit his job rather than be transferred to a department that produced turrets for military tanks. He claimed that producing armaments was contrary to his religious beliefs. The state denied him unemployment benefits because he had voluntarily left his job, but he sued under a line of cases holding that a state may not deny benefits to people who quit their jobs for religious reasons.</p>
<p id="fc63e7d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state argued that the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ faith did not prevent an individual from working in the armaments plant. The state pointed to others from <span title="1675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1675">p. 1675</span>that religion who worked on tank turrets and to testimony that such work was “scripturally” acceptable. The Court said, however, that this was irrelevant and declared, “[T]he guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect. Particularly in this sensitive area, it is not within the judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow worker more correctly perceived the commands of their common faith. Courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.”</p>
<p id="fc63e7da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in Frazee v. Illinois Employment Security Department, 489 U.S. 829 (1989), the Court allowed an individual to claim a religious basis for refusing to work on Sundays even though others of his and similar religions did not have such a proscription. The Court said, “Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection of the Free Exercise Clause, one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.” Thus, the inquiry must be whether a particular individual holds a sincere religious belief.</p>

<p id="fc63e7df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court repeatedly has stated that the government may not compel or punish religious beliefs; people may think and believe anything that they want. In Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 164 (1878), the first case to construe the Free Exercise Clause, Chief Justice Waite wrote that “Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions.” Likewise, in Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 603 (1961), Chief Justice Warren declared that “[t]he freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute.”</p>
<p id="fc63e7e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1676">p. 1676</span>The Free Exercise Clause, however, obviously does not provide absolute protection for religiously motivated conduct. The Court has thus said that the Free Exercise Clause “embraces two concepts—freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1021C_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1021C_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span> Similarly, the Court spoke of the “distinction between the absolute constitutional protection against governmental regulation of religious beliefs on the one hand, and the qualified protection against the regulation of religiously motivated conduct.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10222_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10222_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span></p>
<p id="fc63e7e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Governments, though, do not adopt laws prohibiting or requiring thoughts; statutes invariably regulate conduct. Thus, the Free Exercise Clause is invoked in several situations. One is when the government prohibits behavior that a person’s religion requires. For example, in Reynolds v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law forbidding polygamy even though Mormons said that it was required by their religion.</p>
<p id="fc63e7e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Free Exercise Clause also is invoked when the government requires conduct that a person’s religion prohibits. For instance, the Court rejected a challenge by Amish individuals who said that the requirement that they obtain Social Security numbers and pay Social Security taxes violated their religious beliefs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1022F_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1022F_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">17</a></span></p>
<p id="fc63e7e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, the Free Exercise Clause is invoked when individuals claim that laws burden or make more difficult religious observances. An illustration of this is the many cases where the Court held that the government impermissibly burdens religion if it denies benefits to individuals who quit their jobs for religious reasons.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10238_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10238_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span></p>
<p id="fc63e7e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The current test for the Free Exercise Clause is found in Employment Division v. Smith (1990), below, where the Court very narrowly interpreted its scope. The law before <i>Smith</i> is initially presented, followed by <i>Smith</i>, then the Supreme Court cases about the Free Exercise Clause since <i>Smith</i>, and finally the law under two federal laws that were adopted to effectively overrule Smith: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.</p>

<p id="fc63e7eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court’s earliest treatment of free exercise of religion was in Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 145 (1878). A federal law prohibited polygamy in the territories and a defendant argued that his Mormon religion required that he have multiple wives. The Supreme Court rejected the Free Exercise Clause argument and the claim that the constitutional provision required an exemption from otherwise valid criminal laws. Chief Justice Waite wrote, “[A]s a law of the organization of society under the exclusive dominion of the United States, it is provided that plural marriages shall not be allowed. Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.”</p>
<p id="fc63e7ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court thus drew a distinction between beliefs and action; the Free Exercise Clause limited government regulation of the former, but not the latter. Chief Justice Waite said, “Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.”</p>
<p id="fc63e7ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court’s initial explicit protection of free exercise of religion occurred in a series of cases that involved laws restricting religious groups from soliciting funds. For example, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940), overturned the convictions of several Jehovah’s Witnesses who were convicted of soliciting money without a license. Although the Court recognized that freedom of religious conduct was not absolute, it said that “[i]n every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly <span title="1677" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1677">p. 1677</span>to infringe the protected freedom.” The Court said that a licensing system for religious solicitations violated both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc640efe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Sherbert v. Verner</i>, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), the Court expressly held that strict scrutiny should be used in evaluating laws burdening free exercise of religion and declared unconstitutional the denial of unemployment benefits to a woman who was discharged from her job rather than work on her Saturday Sabbath. The Court described the facts: “Appellant, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church was discharged by her South Carolina employer because she would not work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith. When she was unable to obtain other employment because from conscientious scruples she would not take Saturday work, she filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits under the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act. The appellee Employment Security Commission, in administrative proceedings under the statute, found that appellant’s restriction upon her availability for Saturday work brought her within the provision disqualifying for benefits insured workers who fail, without good cause, to accept “suitable work when offered . . . by the employment office or the employer. . . .”</p>
<p id="fc640eff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court then explained why this was unconstitutional: “If, therefore, the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court is to withstand appellant’s constitutional challenge, it must be either because her disqualification as a beneficiary represents no infringement by the State of her constitutional rights of free exercise, or because any incidental burden on the free exercise of appellant’s religion may be justified by a ‘compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the State’s constitutional power to regulate.’”</p>
<p id="fc640f00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here not only is it apparent that appellant’s declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.</p>
<p id="fc640f01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must next consider whether some compelling state interest enforced in the eligibility provisions of the South Carolina statute justifies the substantial infringement of appellant’s First Amendment right. It is basic that no showing merely of a rational relationship to some colorable state interest would suffice; in this highly sensitive constitutional area, even if the possibility of spurious claims did threaten to dilute the fund and disrupt the scheduling of work, it would plainly be incumbent upon the appellees to demonstrate that no alternative forms of regulation would combat such abuses without infringing First Amendment rights.”</p>
<p id="fc640f02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Sherbert</i> clearly stated that strict scrutiny was to be used in evaluating laws infringing free exercise of religion, following <i>Sherbert</i> the Court rarely struck down laws on this basis. In fact, there were only two areas where the Court invalidated laws for violating free exercise: laws, like the statute in <i>Sherbert</i>, that denied benefits to those who quit their jobs for religious reasons; and the application of a compulsory school law to the Amish. In all other Free Exercise Clause cases between 1960 and 1990, the Court upheld the laws.</p>

<p id="fc640f05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In several later cases, the Court reaffirmed its holding in Sherbert v. Verner that the government could not deny benefits to individuals who left their jobs because of religious reasons. For example, in Thomas v. Review Board, 450 U.S. 707 (1981), the Court held that the government could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who quit his job rather than accept a transfer to work in the armaments section of a factory. The individual said that he was quitting for religious reasons, and the Court said it accepted this explanation even though others of his faith saw no problem in working in that part of the factory. The Court said that it was not for the judiciary to evaluate the proper content of religious doctrines and said it was “clear that Thomas terminated his employment for religious reasons.”</p>
<p id="fc640f06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Commission of Florida, 480 U.S. 136 (1987), the Court applied <i>Sherbert</i> and <i>Thomas</i> and held that the state was required to provide unemployment benefits to a woman who was fired when she refused to work on her Saturday Sabbath. Similarly, in Frazee v. Illinois Department of Employment Security, 489 U.S. 829 (1989), the Court found that a state law that required unemployed individuals to be available for work seven days a week infringed free exercise when it was applied to deny benefits to an individual who refused to work on his Sunday Sabbath. The Court said it was immaterial that the individual was not a member of an organized church, sect, or denomination. His sincere religious belief was impermissibly burdened by the denial of benefits.</p>

<p id="fc640f09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only other case where the Court found a violation of the Free Exercise Clause during this time was in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), where the Court held that free exercise of religion required that Amish parents be granted an exemption from compulsory school laws for their 14- and 15-year-old children. The Court noted that the “Amish objection to formal education beyond the eighth grade is firmly grounded in these central religious concepts. They object to the high school, and higher education generally, because the values they teach are in marked variance with Amish values and the Amish way of life; they view secondary school education as an impermissible exposure of their children to a ‘worldly’ influence in conflict with their beliefs.” The Court said that “[a] regulation neutral on its face may, in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.”</p>
<p id="fc640f0a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court accepted this argument and found that requiring 14- and 15-year-old Amish children to attend school violated the Free Exercise Clause and also infringed the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, said that “the record in this case abundantly supports the claim that the traditional way of life of the Amish is not merely a matter of personal preference, but one of deep religious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living.” The Court concluded that “[t]he impact of the compulsory-attendance law on respondents’ practice of the Amish religion is not only severe, but inescapable, for <span title="1679" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1679">p. 1679</span>the Wisconsin law affirmatively compels them, under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts undeniably at odds with . . . their religious beliefs. . . . [E]nforcement of the State’s requirement of compulsory formal education after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents’ religious beliefs.”</p>
<p id="fc640f0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concluded that the “self-sufficient” nature of Amish society made education for 14- and 15-year-old children unnecessary. The Court said that the lack of “two additional years of compulsory education will not impair the physical or mental health of the child, or result in an inability to be self-supporting or to discharge the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, or in any other way materially detract from the welfare of society.” In <i>Smith</i>, the Court distinguished <i>Yoder</i> as involving “hybrid” rights, specifically the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children.</p>

<p id="fc640f0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other than the employment compensation cases and <i>Yoder</i>, the Court during this period found no other law to violate the Free Exercise Clause. The Court was asked in many cases to allow an exemption to a law based on free exercise. In each the Court rejected the constitutional claim.</p>
<p id="fc640f0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases rejecting free exercise challenges occurred in a wide variety of contexts. For example, two years before <i>Sherbert</i>, in Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599 (1961), the Supreme Court rejected a Free Exercise Clause challenge to Sunday closing laws. Orthodox Jews argued that their religion required that their businesses be closed on Saturdays and that it was difficult for them to adhere to their religion if they also had to be closed Sundays. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the plurality, rejected this argument and said, “[T]he statute before us does not make criminal the holding of any religious belief or opinion, nor does it force anyone to embrace any religious belief. . . . To strike down legislation which imposes only an indirect burden on the exercise of religion would radically restrict the operating latitude of the legislature.” The Court accepted the state’s argument that Sunday closing laws served the important government interest of providing a uniform day of rest.</p>
<p id="fc640f10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases during this time period, the Court rejected challenges to tax laws based on free exercise of religion. In United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982), the Court rejected a claim by an Amish individual that the requirement for paying Social Security taxes violated the Free Exercise Clause. The argument was that “the Amish believe it sinful not to provide for their own elderly and therefore are religiously opposed to the national social security system.” The Court found, however, that this restriction on religious freedom was “essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.” The Court concluded that mandatory participation in the Social Security system was “indispensable to [its] fiscal vitality.”</p>
<p id="fc640f11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), where the Court held that the <span title="1680" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1680">p. 1680</span>denial of tax exempt status to private schools that racially discriminated because of sincere religious beliefs did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Burger, explained, “[T]he Government has a fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education [which] substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on petitioners’ exercise of their religious beliefs.” The Court found that eliminating discrimination was a compelling government interest and that “no less restrictive means are available to achieve the government interest.”</p>
<p id="fc640f12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986), the Court rejected the claim for a religious exemption to the requirement that individuals provide Social Security numbers in order to receive welfare benefits. Individuals argued that their religion was violated by the requirement for Social Security numbers. The Court denied this claim and declared, “Never to our knowledge has the Court interpreted the First Amendment to require the Government <i>itself</i> to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual development. . . . [The] Free Exercise Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s internal procedures.”</p>
<p id="fc643623-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court rejected a free exercise challenge to the military in Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503 (1986), where the Court, by a five-to-four margin, denied the claim of an Orthodox Jewish doctor in the Air Force who said that his religion required that he wear a yarmulke in violation of the dress code. Simcha Goldman, a clinical psychologist in the Air Force, was an Orthodox Jew and an ordained rabbi. He was ordered not to wear his yarmulke on duty because it was inconsistent with the Air Force dress code.</p>
<p id="fc643624-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court proclaimed the need for deference to the military and said that “[o]ur review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.” The Court said that “to accomplish its mission the military must foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment and espirit de corps. The essence of military service is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of the service.” The Court concluded that it accepted the “considered professional judgment of the Air Force . . . that the traditional outfitting of personnel in standardized uniforms encourages the subordination of personal preferences and identities in favor of the overall group mission.” Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, concluded that the “First Amendment does not require the military to accommodate such practices in the face of its view that they would detract from the uniformity sought by the dress regulations.”</p>
<p id="fc643625-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these cases, the Courts refused to uphold free exercise challenges to specific laws. In Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), the Court made this even more explicit and rejected a Free Exercise Clause challenge to the federal government’s building a road and allowing timber harvesting in a national forest that contained sacred Indian burial grounds. The Court recognized that the construction would “virtually . . . destroy the Indians’ ability to practice their religion” because it would irreparably damage “sacred areas which are an integral and necessary part of their belief systems.” Nonetheless, the Court said that “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens. . . . [The] Free Exercise Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of government compulsion; it does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s internal procedures.”</p>

<p id="fc643634-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The free exercise of religion means, first and foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires. Thus, the First Amendment obviously excludes all “governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such.” The government may not compel affirmation of religious belief, punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false, impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, or lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma.</p>
<p id="fc643635-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the “exercise of religion” often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts: assembling with others for a worship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and wine, proselytizing, abstaining from certain foods or certain modes of transportation. <span title="1682" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1682">p. 1682</span>It would be true, we think (though no case of ours has involved the point), that a State would be “prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]” if it sought to ban such acts or abstentions only when they are engaged in for religious reasons, or only because of the religious belief that they display. It would doubtless be unconstitutional, for example, to ban the casting of “statues that are to be used for worship purposes,” or to prohibit bowing down before a golden calf.</p>
<p id="fc643636-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents in the present case, however, seek to carry the meaning of “prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]” one large step further. They contend that their religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of a criminal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice, and that is concededly constitutional as applied to those who use the drug for other reasons. They assert, in other words, that “prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]” includes requiring any individual to observe a generally applicable law that requires (or forbids) the performance of an act that his religious belief forbids (or requires). As a textual matter, we do not think the words must be given that meaning.</p>
<p id="fc643637-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate. On the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise jurisprudence contradicts that proposition. [D]ecisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a “valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).”</p>
<p id="fc645d48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our most recent decision involving a neutral, generally applicable regulatory law that compelled activity forbidden by an individual’s religion was United States v. Lee. There an Amish employer, on behalf of himself and his employees, sought exemption from collection and payment of Social Security taxes on the ground that the Amish faith prohibited participation in governmental support programs. We rejected the claim that an exemption was constitutionally required. There would be no way, we observed, to distinguish the Amish believer’s objection to Social Security taxes from the religious objections that others might have to the collection or use of other taxes. “If, for example, a religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income tax. The tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.”</p>

Connecticut [1940] (invalidating a licensing system for religious and charitable solicitations under which the administrator had discretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious); Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943) (invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious ideas); or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v.

<p id="fc645d4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case does not present such a hybrid situation, but a free exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right. Respondents urge us to hold, quite simply, that when otherwise prohibitable conduct is accompanied by religious convictions, not only the convictions but the conduct itself must be free from governmental regulation. We have never held that, and decline to do so now. There being no contention that Oregon’s drug law represents an attempt to regulate religious beliefs, the communication of religious beliefs, or the raising of one’s children in those beliefs, the rule to which we have adhered ever since <i>Reynolds</i> plainly controls.</p>
<p id="fc645d4b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents argue that even though exemption from generally applicable criminal laws need not automatically be extended to religiously motivated actors, at least the claim for a religious exemption must be evaluated under the balancing test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963). Under the <i>Sherbert</i> test, governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a compelling governmental interest. Applying that test we have, on three occasions, invalidated state unemployment compensation rules that conditioned the availability of benefits upon an applicant’s willingness to work under conditions forbidden by his religion. We have never invalidated any governmental action on the basis of the <i>Sherbert</i> test except the denial of unemployment compensation. Although we have sometimes purported to apply the <i>Sherbert</i> test in contexts other than that, we have always found the test satisfied.</p>
<p id="fc645d4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years we have abstained from applying the <i>Sherbert</i> test (outside the unemployment compensation field) at all. In Bowen v. Roy (1986), we declined to apply <i>Sherbert</i> analysis to a federal statutory scheme that required benefit applicants and recipients to provide their Social Security numbers. The plaintiffs in that case asserted that it would violate their religious beliefs to obtain and provide a Social Security number for their daughter. We held the statute’s application to the plaintiffs valid regardless of whether it was necessary to effectuate a compelling interest.</p>
<p id="fc645d4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn. (1988), we declined to apply <i>Sherbert</i> analysis to the Government’s logging and road construction activities on lands used for religious purposes by several Native American Tribes, even though it was undisputed that the activities “could have devastating effects on traditional Indian religious practices.” In Goldman v. Weinberger (1986), we rejected application of the <i>Sherbert</i> test to military dress regulations that forbade the wearing of yarmulkes.</p>
<p id="fc645d4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were inclined to breathe into <i>Sherbert</i> some life beyond the unemployment compensation field, we would not apply it to require exemptions from a generally applicable criminal law. The <i>Sherbert</i> test, it must be recalled, was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct. As a plurality of the Court noted in <i>Roy</i>, a distinctive feature of unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind an applicant’s unemployment. Whether or not the decisions are that limited, they at least have nothing to do with an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct.</p>
<p id="fc645d4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government’s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public <span title="1684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1684">p. 1684</span>policy, “cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector’s spiritual development.” To make an individual’s obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State’s interest is “compelling”—permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, “to become a law unto himself”—contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.</p>
<p id="fc645d50-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “compelling government interest” requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, or before the government may regulate the content of speech, is not remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields—equality of treatment and an unrestricted flow of contending speech—are constitutional norms; what it would produce here—a private right to ignore generally applicable laws—is a constitutional anomaly.</p>
<p id="fc645d51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is it possible to limit the impact of respondents’ proposal by requiring a “compelling state interest” only when the conduct prohibited is “central” to the individual’s religion. It is no more appropriate for judges to determine the “centrality” of religious beliefs before applying a “compelling interest” test in the free exercise field, than it would be for them to determine the “importance” of ideas before applying the “compelling interest” test in the free speech field. What principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer’s assertion that a particular act is “central” to his personal faith? Judging the centrality of different religious practices is akin to the unacceptable “business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims.”</p>
<p id="fc645d52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the “compelling interest” test is to be applied at all, then, it must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously commanded. Moreover, if “compelling interest” really means what it says (and watering it down here would subvert its rigor in the other fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that danger increases in direct proportion to the society’s diversity of religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of them. Precisely because “we are a cosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost every conceivable religious preference,” and precisely because we value and protect that religious divergence, we cannot afford the luxury of deeming presumptively invalid, as applied to the religious objector, every regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the highest order. The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind—ranging from compulsory military service to the payment of taxes, to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws, to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races. The First Amendment’s protection of religious liberty does not require this.</p>
<p id="fc645d53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Values that are protected against government interference through enshrinement in the Bill of Rights are not thereby banished from the political process. Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to the press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster the dissemination of the printed word, so also a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to be solicitous of that value in <span title="1685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1685">p. 1685</span>its legislation as well. It is therefore not surprising that a number of States have made an exception to their drug laws for sacramental peyote use.</p>
<p id="fc645d54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious-practice exemption is permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally required, and that the appropriate occasions for its creation can be discerned by the courts. It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc645d55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because respondents’ ingestion of peyote was prohibited under Oregon law, and because that prohibition is constitutional, Oregon may, consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment compensation when their dismissal results from use of the drug.</p>

<p id="fc645d57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although I agree with the result the Court reaches in this case, I cannot join its opinion. In my view, today’s holding dramatically departs from well-settled First Amendment jurisprudence, appears unnecessary to resolve the question presented, and is incompatible with our Nation’s fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty.</p>
<p id="fc645d58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today extracts from our long history of free exercise precedents the single categorical rule that “if prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is . . . merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.” Indeed, the Court holds that where the law is a generally applicable criminal prohibition, our usual free exercise jurisprudence does not even apply. To reach this sweeping result, however, the Court must not only give a strained reading of the First Amendment but must also disregard our consistent application of free exercise doctrine to cases involving generally applicable regulations that burden religious conduct.</p>
<p id="fc645d59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today interprets the Clause to permit the government to prohibit, without justification, conduct mandated by an individual’s religious beliefs, so long as that prohibition is generally applicable. But a law that prohibits certain conduct—conduct that happens to be an act of worship for someone—manifestly does prohibit that person’s free exercise of his religion. A person who is barred from engaging in religiously motivated conduct is barred from freely exercising his religion. Moreover, that person is barred from freely exercising his religion regardless of whether the law prohibits the conduct only when engaged in for religious reasons, only by members of that religion, or by all persons. It is difficult to deny that a law that prohibits religiously motivated conduct, even if the law is generally applicable, does not at least implicate First Amendment concerns.</p>
<p id="fc64846a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court responds that generally applicable laws are “one large step” removed from laws aimed at specific religious practices. The First Amendment, however, does not distinguish between laws that are generally applicable and laws that target particular religious practices. Indeed, few States would be so naïve as to enact a law directly prohibiting or burdening a religious practice as such. Our free exercise cases have all concerned generally applicable laws <span title="1686" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1686">p. 1686</span>that had the effect of significantly burdening a religious practice. If the First Amendment is to have any vitality, it ought not be construed to cover only the extreme and hypothetical situation in which a State directly targets a religious practice. As we have noted in a slightly different context, “[s]uch a test has no basis in precedent and relegates a serious First Amendment value to the barest level of minimum scrutiny that the Equal Protection Clause already provides.”</p>
<p id="fc64846b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To say that a person’s right to free excise has been burdened, of course, does not mean that he has an absolute right to engage in the conduct. Under our established First Amendment jurisprudence, we have recognized that the freedom to act, unlike the freedom to believe, cannot be absolute. Instead, we have respected both the First Amendment’s express textual mandate and the governmental interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.</p>
<p id="fc64846c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The compelling interest test effectuates the First Amendment’s command that religious liberty is an independent liberty, that it occupies a preferred position, and that the Court will not permit encroachments upon this liberty, whether direct or indirect, unless required by clear and compelling governmental interests “of the highest order.” “Only an especially important governmental interest pursued by narrowly tailored means can justify exacting a sacrifice of First Amendments freedoms as the price for an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”</p>
<p id="fc64846d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court attempts to support its narrow reading of the Clause by claiming that “[w]e have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.” But as the Court later notes, as it must, in cases such as <i>Cantwell</i> and <i>Yoder</i> we have in fact interpreted the Free Exercise Clause to forbid application of a generally applicable prohibition to religiously motivated conduct.</p>
<p id="fc64846e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, in each of the other cases cited by the Court to support its categorical rule, we rejected the particular constitutional claims before us only after carefully weighing the competing interests. That we rejected the free exercise claims in those cases hardly calls into question the applicability of First Amendment doctrine in the first place. Indeed, it is surely unusual to judge the vitality of a constitutional doctrine by looking to the win-loss record of the plaintiffs who happen to come before us.</p>
<p id="fc64846f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, however, the essence of a free exercise claim is relief from a burden imposed by government on religious practices or beliefs, whether the burden is imposed directly through laws that prohibit or compel specific religious practices, or indirectly through laws that, in effect, make abandonment of one’s own religion or conformity to the religious beliefs of others the price of an equal place in the civil community.</p>
<p id="fc648470-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it has been shown that a government regulation or criminal prohibition burdens the free exercise of religion, we have consistently asked the government to demonstrate that unbending application of its regulation to the religious objector “is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest,” or represents “the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.”</p>
<p id="fc648471-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To me, the sounder approach—the approach more consistent with our role as judges to decide each case on its individual merits—is to apply this test in each case to determine whether the burden on the specific plaintiffs before <span title="1687" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1687">p. 1687</span>us is constitutionally significant and whether the particular criminal interest asserted by the State before us is compelling. Even if, as an empirical matter, a government’s criminal laws might usually serve a compelling interest in health, safety, or public order, the First Amendment at least requires a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim. Given the range of conduct that a State might legitimately make criminal, we cannot assume, merely because a law carries criminal sanctions and is generally applicable, that the First Amendment never requires the State to grant a limited exemption for religiously motivated conduct.</p>
<p id="fc648472-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today gives no convincing reason to depart from settled First Amendment jurisprudence. There is nothing talismanic about neutral law of general applicability or general criminal prohibitions, for laws neutral toward religion can coerce a person to violate his religious conscience or intrude upon his religious duties just as effectively as laws aimed at religion. Although the Court suggests that the compelling interest test, as applied to generally applicable laws, would result in a “constitutional anomaly,” the First Amendment unequivocally makes freedom of religion, like freedom from race discrimination and freedom of speech a “constitutional nor[m],” not an “anomaly.” Nor would application of our established free exercise doctrine to this case necessarily be incompatible with our equal protection cases. As the language of the Clauses itself makes clear, an individual’s free exercise of religion is a preferred constitutional activity. A law that makes criminal such an activity therefore triggers constitutional concern—and heightened judicial scrutiny—even if it does not target the particular religious conduct at issue. Our free speech cases similarly recognize that neutral regulations that affect free speech values are subject to a balancing, rather than categorical, approach. The Court’s parade of horribles not only fails as a reason for discarding the compelling interest test, it instead demonstrates just the opposite: that courts have been quite capable of applying our free exercise jurisprudence to strike sensible balances between religious liberty and competing state interests.</p>
<p id="fc648473-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court today suggests that the disfavoring of minority religions is an “unavoidable consequence” under our system of government and that accommodation of such religions must be left to the political process. In my view, however, the First Amendment was enacted precisely to protect the rights of those whose religious practices are not shared by the majority and may be viewed with hostility. The history of our free exercise doctrine amply demonstrates the harsh impact majoritarian rule has had on unpopular or emerging religious groups such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Amish. Indeed, the words of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1940) are apt:</p>

<p id="fc648475-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment’s mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.

I would reach the same result applying our established free exercise jurisprudence. There is no dispute that Oregon’s criminal prohibition of peyote places a severe burden on the ability of respondents to freely exercise their religion. Peyote is a sacrament of the Native American Church and is regarded as vital to respondents’ ability to practice their religion. There is also no dispute that Oregon has a significant interest in enforcing laws that control the possession and use of controlled substances by its citizens. As we recently noted, drug abuse is “one of the greatest problems affecting the health and welfare of our population” and thus “one of the most serious problems confronting our society today.” Oregon has a compelling interest in prohibiting the possession of peyote by its citizens. Although the question is close, I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon’s criminal prohibition is “essential to accomplish[],” its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance. Oregon’s criminal prohibition represents that State’s judgment that the possession and use of controlled substances, even by only one person, is inherently harmful and dangerous. Because the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them. Moreover, in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon’s stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote.</p>
<p id="fc648477-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, I believe that granting a selective exemption in this case would seriously impair Oregon’s compelling interest in prohibiting possession of peyote by its citizens. Under such circumstances, the Free Exercise Clause does not require the State to accommodate respondents’ religiously motivated conduct. I would therefore adhere to our established free exercise jurisprudence and hold that the State in this case has a compelling interest in regulating peyote use by its citizens and that accommodating respondents’ religiously motivated conduct “will unduly interfere with fulfillment of the government interest.”</p>

<p id="fc648479-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court over the years painstakingly has developed a consistent and exacting standard to test the constitutionality of a state statute that burdens the free exercise of religion. Such a statute may stand only if the law in general, and the State’s refusal to allow a religious exemption in particular, are justified by a compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive means. Until today, I thought this was a settled and inviolate principle of this Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence. The majority, however, perfunctorily dismisses it as a “constitutional anomaly.” In short, it effectuates a wholesale overturning of settled law concerning the Religion Clauses of our Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc64847a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State proclaims an interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens from the dangers of unlawful drugs. It offers, however, no evidence that the religious use of peyote has ever harmed anyone. The carefully circumscribed ritual context in which respondents used peyote is far removed from the irresponsible and unrestricted recreational use of unlawful drugs. The Native American <span title="1689" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1689">p. 1689</span>Church’s internal restrictions on, and supervision of, its members’ use of peyote substantially obviate the State’s health and safety concerns.</p>
<p id="fc64847b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, I conclude that Oregon’s interest in enforcing its drug laws against religious use of peyote is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh respondents’ right to the free exercise of their religion. The State could not constitutionally enforce its criminal prohibition against respondents, the interests underlying the State’s drug laws cannot justify its denial of unemployment benefits.</p>

Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993), the Court struck down a law that prohibited ritual sacrifice of animals on the ground that it was not a neutral law of general applicability. The Santeria religion uses animal sacrifice as one of its principal forms of worship. Animals are killed and then cooked and eaten in accord with Santeria rituals. After practitioners of Santeria announced plans to establish a house of worship, a school, a cultural center, and a museum in Hialeah, Florida, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting ritual sacrifice of animals. The law defined “sacrifice” as killing animals “not for the primary purpose of food consumption.” The law applied only to an individual or group that “kills, slaughters, or sacrifices animals for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh or blood of the animal is to be consumed.”</p>
<p id="fc64ab92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the justices agreed the law was unconstitutional, with Justice Kennedy writing the opinion for the Court. At the outset, Justice Kennedy reaffirmed the <i>Smith</i> test and declared that “our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.” Kennedy said, however, that “[a] law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a compelling interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.”</p>
<p id="fc64ab93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court decided that the Hialeah law was not neutral because its clear object was to prohibit a religious practice. Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion noted that the text of the law spoke of “sacrifice” and “ritual” and that its purpose was clearly to prohibit the practice of the Santeria religion. The Court also focused on the exceptions to the law that allowed killing of animals by other religions, such as in kosher slaughtering of animals, and that allowed killing of animals for nonreligious purposes. The Court said that this further indicated the lack of neutrality of the law. The Court concluded that “the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion.”</p>

Many types of animal deaths or kills are either not prohibited or approved by express provision.”</p>
<p id="fc64ab95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because it concluded that the ordinance was neither neutral nor of general applicability, the Court applied strict scrutiny. The Court found the law unconstitutional because the government could achieve the goals of safe and sanitary disposal of animal remains without targeting the Santeria religion.</p>
<p id="fc64ab96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Scalia, in an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, wrote separately to argue that the purpose behind a law should not be relevant in determining whether it is neutral and of general applicability. Justice Souter also wrote an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. He argued that the Court should reconsider and overrule <i>Smith</i>. Justice Blackmun concurred in the judgment, in an opinion joined by Justice O’Connor, and “emphasize[d] that the First Amendment’s protection of religion extends beyond those rare occasions on which the government explicitly targets religion (or a particular religion) for disfavored treatment.”</p>

<p id="fc64ab9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kennedy</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc64ab9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2012 a same-sex couple visited Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, to make inquiries about ordering a cake for their wedding reception. The shop’s owner told the couple that he would not create a cake for their wedding because of his religious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages the State of Colorado itself did not recognize at that time. The couple filed a charge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of the Colorado Anti–Discrimination Act.</p>
<p id="fc64d2af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commission determined that the shop’s actions violated the Act and ruled in the couple’s favor. The Colorado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement order, and this Court now must decide whether the Commission’s order violated the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case presents difficult questions as to the proper reconciliation of at least two principles. The first is the authority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the rights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married but who face discrimination when they seek goods or services. The second is the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms under the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The freedoms asserted here are both the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion. The free speech aspect of this case is difficult, for few persons who have seen a beautiful wedding cake might have thought of its creation as an exercise of protected speech. This is an instructive example, however, of <span title="1691" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1691">p. 1691</span>the proposition that the application of constitutional freedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their meaning.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the difficulties in this case is that the parties disagree as to the extent of the baker’s refusal to provide service. If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or images celebrating the marriage—for instance, a cake showing words with religious meaning—that might be different from a refusal to sell any cake at all. In defining whether a baker’s creation can be protected, these details might make a difference.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same difficulties arise in determining whether a baker has a valid free exercise claim. A baker’s refusal to attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way, or a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the cake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the public generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on it are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but endless.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the confluence of speech and free exercise principles might be in some cases, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission’s consideration of this case was inconsistent with the State’s obligation of religious neutrality. The reason and motive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious beliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws. Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach. That requirement, however, was not met here. When the Colorado Civil Rights Commission considered this case, it did not do so with the religious neutrality that the Constitution requires.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given all these considerations, it is proper to hold that whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving facts similar to these, the Commission’s actions here violated the Free Exercise Clause; and its order must be set aside.</p>

<p id="fc64d2b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a bakery in Lakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The shop offers a variety of baked goods, ranging from everyday cookies and brownies to elaborate custom-designed cakes for birthday parties, weddings, and other events.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jack Phillips is an expert baker who has owned and operated the shop for 24 years. Phillips is a devout Christian. He has explained that his “main goal in life is to be obedient to” Jesus Christ and Christ’s “teachings in all aspects of his life.” And he seeks to “honor God through his work at Masterpiece Cakeshop.” One of Phillips’ religious beliefs is that “God’s intention for marriage from the beginning of history is that it is and should be the union of one man and one woman.” To Phillips, creating a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding would be equivalent to participating in a celebration that is contrary to his own most deeply held beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc64d2b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when they entered his shop in the summer of 2012. Craig and Mullins were planning to marry. At that time, Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed <span title="1692" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1692">p. 1692</span>legally in Massachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family and friends in Denver. To prepare for their celebration, Craig and Mullins visited the shop and told Phillips that they were interested in ordering a cake for “our wedding.” They did not mention the design of the cake they envisioned.</p>
<p id="fc64d2ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Phillips informed the couple that he does not “create” wedding cakes for same-sex weddings. He explained, “I’ll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same sex weddings.” The couple left the shop without further discussion.</p>
<p id="fc64d2bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following day, Craig’s mother, who had accompanied the couple to the cakeshop and been present for their interaction with Phillips, telephoned to ask Phillips why he had declined to serve her son. Phillips explained that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious opposition to same-sex marriage, and also because Colorado (at that time) did not recognize same-sex marriages. He later explained his belief that “to create a wedding cake for an event that celebrates something that directly goes against the teachings of the Bible, would have been a personal endorsement and participation in the ceremony and relationship that they were entering into.”</p>
<p id="fc64d2bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) carries forward the state’s tradition of prohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation. Amended in 2007 and 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in relevant part provides as follows:</p>
<p id="fc64d2bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or deny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation.”</p>
<p id="fc64d2be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act defines “public accommodation” broadly to include any “place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place offering services . . . to the public,” but excludes “a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place that is principally used for religious purposes.”</p>
<p id="fc64f9cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Craig and Mullins filed a discrimination complaint against Masterpiece Cakeshop and Phillips in September 2012, shortly after the couple’s visit to the shop. App. 31. The complaint alleged that Craig and Mullins had been denied “full and equal service” at the bakery because of their sexual orientation, and that it was Phillips’ “standard business practice” not to provide cakes for same-sex weddings.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Civil Rights Division opened an investigation. The investigator found that “on multiple occasions,” Phillips “turned away potential customers on the basis of their sexual orientation, stating that he could not create a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony or reception” because his religious beliefs prohibited it and because the potential customers “were doing something illegal” at that time. The investigation found that Phillips had declined to sell custom wedding cakes to about six other same-sex couples on this basis. The investigator also recounted that, according to affidavits submitted by Craig and Mullins, Phillips’ shop had refused to sell cupcakes to a lesbian couple for their commitment celebration because the shop “had a policy of not selling baked goods to same-sex couples for this type of event.” Based on these findings, the Division found probable cause that Phillips violated CADA and referred the case to the Civil Rights Commission.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1693" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1693">p. 1693</span>The Commission found it proper to conduct a formal hearing, and it sent the case to a State ALJ. Finding no dispute as to material facts, the ALJ entertained cross-motions for summary judgment and ruled in the couple’s favor. The ALJ first rejected Phillips’ argument that declining to make or create a wedding cake for Craig and Mullins did not violate Colorado law. It was undisputed that the shop is subject to state public accommodations laws. And the ALJ determined that Phillips’ actions constituted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, not simply opposition to same-sex marriage as Phillips contended.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commission affirmed the ALJ’s decision in full. The Commission ordered Phillips to “cease and desist from discriminating against . . . same-sex couples by refusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [they] would sell to heterosexual couples.” It also ordered additional remedial measures, including “comprehensive staff training on the Public Accommodations section” of CADA “and changes to any and all company policies to comply with . . . this Order.” The Commission additionally required Phillips to prepare “quarterly compliance reports” for a period of two years documenting “the number of patrons denied service” and why, along with “a statement describing the remedial actions taken.” Phillips appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Commission’s legal determinations and remedial order.</p>

<p id="fc64f9d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts. At the same time, the religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression. As this Court observed in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), “[t]he First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.” Nevertheless, while those religious and philosophical objections are protected, it is a general rule that such objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion. This refusal would be well understood in our constitutional order as an exercise of religion, an exercise that gay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment to their own dignity and worth. Yet if that exception were not confined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and services for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay persons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure equal access to goods, services, and public accommodations.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1694" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1694">p. 1694</span>It is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment. Petitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings, that would be a different matter and the State would have a strong case under this Court’s precedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that went beyond any protected rights of a baker who offers goods and services to the general public and is subject to a neutrally applied and generally applicable public accommodations law.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue is presented. He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own voice and of his own creation. As Phillips would see the case, this contention has a significant First Amendment speech component and implicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs. In this context the baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the customers’ rights to goods and services became a demand for him to exercise the right of his own personal expression for their message, a message he could not express in a way consistent with his religious beliefs. Phillips’ dilemma was particularly understandable given the background of legal principles and administration of the law in Colorado at that time. His decision and his actions leading to the refusal of service all occurred in the year 2012. At that point, Colorado did not recognize the validity of gay marriages performed in its own State. Since the State itself did not allow those marriages to be performed in Colorado, there is some force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in deeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood to be an expression of support for their validity when that expression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at least insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and express a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to take place in another State.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time, state law also afforded storekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages the storekeeper considered offensive. Indeed, while enforcement proceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado Civil Rights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving other bakers’ creation of cakes, concluding on at least three occasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages.</p>
<p id="fc64f9d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]ny decision in favor of the baker would have to be sufficiently constrained, lest all purveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons in effect be allowed to put up signs saying “no goods or services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages,” something that would impose a serious stigma on gay persons. But, nonetheless, Phillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p id="fc64f9da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The neutral and respectful consideration to which Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however. The Civil Rights Commission’s treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.</p>
<p id="fc64f9db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That hostility surfaced at the Commission’s formal, public hearings, as shown by the record. On May 30, 2014, the seven-member Commission convened <span title="1695" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1695">p. 1695</span>publicly to consider Phillips’ case. At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s business community. One commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe “what he wants to believe,” but cannot act on his religious beliefs “if he decides to do business in the state.” A few moments later, the commissioner restated the same position: “[I]f a businessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue with the—the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise.” Standing alone, these statements are susceptible of different interpretations. On the one hand, they might mean simply that a business cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual orientation, regardless of the proprietor’s personal views. On the other hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive comments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips’ free exercise rights and the dilemma he faced. In view of the comments that followed, the latter seems the more likely.</p>
<p id="fc64f9dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again. This meeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record. On this occasion another commissioner made specific reference to the previous meeting’s discussion but said far more to disparage Phillips’ beliefs. The commissioner stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc64f9dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“I would also like to reiterate what we said in the hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust, whether it be—I mean, we—we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to—to use their religion to hurt others.”</p>
</div>
<p id="fc64f9de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To describe a man’s faith as “one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use” is to disparage his religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical—something insubstantial and even insincere. The commissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips’ invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of Colorado’s antidiscrimination law—a law that protects against discrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual orientation.</p>
<p id="fc651fef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record shows no objection to these comments from other commissioners. And the later state-court ruling reviewing the Commission’s decision did not mention those comments, much less express concern with their content. Nor were the comments by the commissioners disavowed in the briefs filed in this Court. For these reasons, the Court cannot avoid the conclusion that these statements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission’s adjudication of Phillips’ case. Members of the Court have disagreed on the question whether statements made by lawmakers may properly be taken into account in determining whether a law intentionally discriminates on the basis of religion. In this case, however, the remarks were made in a very different context—by an adjudicatory body deciding a particular case.</p>
<p id="fc651ff0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another indication of hostility is the difference in treatment between Phillips’ case and the cases of other bakers who objected to a requested cake on the basis <span title="1696" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1696">p. 1696</span>of conscience and prevailed before the Commission. As noted above, on at least three other occasions the Civil Rights Division considered the refusal of bakers to create cakes with images that conveyed disapproval of same-sex marriage, along with religious text. Each time, the Division found that the baker acted lawfully in refusing service. It made these determinations because, in the words of the Division, the requested cake included “wording and images [the baker] deemed derogatory,” featured “language and images [the baker] deemed hateful,” or displayed a message the baker “deemed as discriminatory.[”]</p>
<p id="fc651ff1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The treatment of the conscience-based objections at issue in these three cases contrasts with the Commission’s treatment of Phillips’ objection. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the theory that any message the requested wedding cake would carry would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did not address this point in any of the other cases with respect to the cakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism. Additionally, the Division found no violation of CADA in the other cases in part because each bakery was willing to sell other products, including those depicting Christian themes, to the prospective customers. But the Commission dismissed Phillips’ willingness to sell “birthday cakes, shower cakes, [and] cookies and brownies,” to gay and lesbian customers as irrelevant. The treatment of the other cases and Phillips’ case could reasonably be interpreted as being inconsistent as to the question of whether speech is involved, quite apart from whether the cases should ultimately be distinguished. In short, the Commission’s consideration of Phillips’ religious objection did not accord with its treatment of these other objections.</p>
<p id="fc651ff2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons just described, the Commission’s treatment of Phillips’ case violated the State’s duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint. In view of these factors the record here demonstrates that the Commission’s consideration of Phillips’ case was neither tolerant nor respectful of Phillips’ religious beliefs. The Commission gave “every appearance,” of adjudicating Phillips’ religious objection based on a negative normative “evaluation of the particular justification” for his objection and the religious grounds for it. It hardly requires restating that government has no role in deciding or even suggesting whether the religious ground for Phillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate. On these facts, the Court must draw the inference that Phillips’ religious objection was not considered with the neutrality that the Free Exercise Clause requires.</p>
<p id="fc651ff3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the issues here are difficult to resolve, it must be concluded that the State’s interest could have been weighed against Phillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed. The official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners’ comments—comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by the State at any point in the proceedings that led to affirmance of the order—were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires. The Commission’s disparate consideration of Phillips’ case compared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same. For these reasons, the order must be set aside.</p>

<p id="fc651ff5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion. <span title="1697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1697">p. 1697</span>Phillips was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who would give full and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of the circumstances in which this case was presented, considered, and decided. However later cases raising these or similar concerns are resolved in the future, for these reasons the rulings of the Commission and of the state court that enforced the Commission’s order must be invalidated.</p>
<p id="fc651ff6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.</p>
<p id="fc651ff7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Gorsuch</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Alito</span> joins, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc651ff8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith<i>,</i> this Court held that a neutral and generally applicable law will usually survive a constitutional free exercise challenge. <i>Smith</i> remains controversial in many quarters. But we know this with certainty: when the government fails to act neutrally toward the free exercise of religion, it tends to run into trouble. Then the government can prevail only if it satisfies strict scrutiny, showing that its restrictions on religion both serve a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored.</p>
<p id="fc651ff9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision respects these principles. As the Court explains, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission failed to act neutrally toward Jack Phillips’s religious faith. Maybe most notably, the Commission allowed three other bakers to refuse a customer’s request that would have required them to violate their secular commitments. Yet it denied the same accommodation to Mr. Phillips when he refused a customer’s request that would have required him to violate his religious beliefs. As the Court also explains, the only reason the Commission seemed to supply for its discrimination was that it found Mr. Phillips’s religious beliefs “offensive.” That kind of judgmental dismissal of a sincerely held religious belief is, of course, antithetical to the First Amendment and cannot begin to satisfy strict scrutiny. The Constitution protects not just popular religious exercises from the condemnation of civil authorities. It protects them all.</p>
<p id="fc651ffa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Gorsuch</span> joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc651ffb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) violated Jack Phillips’ right to freely exercise his religion. While Phillips rightly prevails on his free-exercise claim, I write separately to address his free-speech claim. The Court does not address this claim because it has some uncertainties about the record.</p>
<p id="fc651ffc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conduct that the Colorado Court of Appeals ascribed to Phillips—creating and designing custom wedding cakes—is expressive. Phillips considers himself an artist. The logo for Masterpiece Cakeshop is an artist’s paint palette with a paintbrush and baker’s whisk. Behind the counter Phillips has a picture that depicts him as an artist painting on a canvas. Phillips takes exceptional care with each cake that he creates—sketching the design out on paper, choosing the color scheme, creating the frosting and decorations, baking and sculpting the cake, decorating it, and delivering it to the wedding. Examples of his creations can be seen on Masterpiece’s website.</p>
<p id="fc651ffd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Phillips is an active participant in the wedding celebration. He sits down with each couple for a consultation before he creates their custom wedding cake. <span title="1698" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1698">p. 1698</span>He discusses their preferences, their personalities, and the details of their wedding to ensure that each cake reflects the couple who ordered it. In addition to creating and delivering the cake—a focal point of the wedding celebration—Phillips sometimes stays and interacts with the guests at the wedding. And the guests often recognize his creations and seek his bakery out afterward. Phillips also sees the inherent symbolism in wedding cakes. To him, a wedding cake inherently communicates that “a wedding has occurred, a marriage has begun, and the couple should be celebrated.”</p>
<p id="fc651ffe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wedding cakes do, in fact, communicate this message. A tradition from Victorian England that made its way to America after the Civil War, “[w]edding cakes are so packed with symbolism that it is hard to know where to begin.” If an average person walked into a room and saw a white, multi-tiered cake, he would immediately know that he had stumbled upon a wedding. The cake is “so standardised and inevitable a part of getting married that few ever think to question it.” Almost no wedding, no matter how spartan, is missing the cake.</p>
<p id="fc65470f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, Phillips’ creation of custom wedding cakes is expressive. The use of his artistic talents to create a well-recognized symbol that celebrates the beginning of a marriage clearly communicates a message—certainly more so than nude dancing, or flying a plain red flag. By forcing Phillips to create custom wedding cakes for same-sex weddings, Colorado’s public-accommodations law “alter[s] the expressive content” of his message. Forcing Phillips to make custom wedding cakes for same-sex marriages requires him to, at the very least, acknowledge that same-sex weddings are “weddings” and suggest that they should be celebrated—the precise message he believes his faith forbids. The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from requiring Phillips to “bear witness to [these] fact[s],” or to “affir[m] . . . a belief with which [he] disagrees.”</p>
<p id="fc654710-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc654711-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is much in the Court’s opinion with which I agree. “[I]t is a general rule that [religious and philosophical] objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.” “Colorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.” “[P]urveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons [may not] put up signs saying ‘no goods or services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages.’” Gay persons may be spared from “indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.” I strongly disagree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that Craig and Mullins should lose this case. All of the above-quoted statements point in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="fc654712-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes that “Phillips’ religious objection was not considered with the neutrality that the Free Exercise Clause requires.” This conclusion rests on <span title="1699" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1699">p. 1699</span>evidence said to show the Colorado Civil Rights Commission’s (Commission) hostility to religion. Hostility is discernible, the Court maintains, from the asserted “disparate consideration of Phillips’ case compared to the cases of” three other bakers who refused to make cakes requested by William Jack. The Court also finds hostility in statements made at two public hearings on Phillips’ appeal to the Commission. The different outcomes the Court features do not evidence hostility to religion of the kind we have previously held to signal a free-exercise violation, nor do the comments by one or two members of one of the four decisionmaking entities considering this case justify reversing the judgment below.</p>
<p id="fc654713-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes that “the Commission’s consideration of Phillips’ religious objection did not accord with its treatment of [the other bakers’] objections.” But the cases the Court aligns are hardly comparable. The bakers would have refused to make a cake with Jack’s requested message for any customer, regardless of his or her religion. And the bakers visited by Jack would have sold him any baked goods they would have sold anyone else. The bakeries’ refusal to make Jack cakes of a kind they would not make for any customer scarcely resembles Phillips’ refusal to serve Craig and Mullins: Phillips would <i>not</i> sell to Craig and Mullins, for no reason other than their sexual orientation, a cake of the kind he regularly sold to others. When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding cake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating <i>their</i> wedding—not a cake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings—and that is the service Craig and Mullins were denied. Colorado, the Court does not gainsay, prohibits precisely the discrimination Craig and Mullins encountered. Jack, on the other hand, suffered no service refusal on the basis of his religion or any other protected characteristic. He was treated as any other customer would have been treated—no better, no worse.</p>
<p id="fc654714-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that Phillips might sell other cakes and cookies to gay and lesbian customers was irrelevant to the issue Craig and Mullins’ case presented. What matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple. In contrast, the other bakeries’ sale of other goods to Christian customers was relevant: It shows that there were no goods the bakeries would sell to a non-Christian customer that they would refuse to sell to a Christian customer.</p>
<p id="fc654715-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statements made at the Commission’s public hearings on Phillips’ case provide no firmer support for the Court’s holding today. Whatever one may think of the statements in historical context, I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins. The proceedings involved several layers of independent decisionmaking, of which the Commission was but one. First, the Division had to find probable cause that Phillips violated CADA. Second, the ALJ entertained the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. Third, the Commission heard Phillips’ appeal. Fourth, after the Commission’s ruling, the Colorado Court of Appeals considered the case <i>de novo</i>. What prejudice infected the determinations of the adjudicators in the case before and after the Commission? The Court does not say. Phillips’ case is thus far removed from the only precedent upon which the Court relies, Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993), where the government action that violated a principle of religious neutrality implicated a sole decisionmaking body, the city council.</p>

<p id="fc654716-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop</i> left open the underlying question: does it violate free exercise of religion or freedom of speech to hold a business liable when it refuses to serve a same-sex couple because of the business owner’s <span title="1700" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1700">p. 1700</span>religious beliefs?

<p id="fc654719-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another instance where the Court found a violation of free exercise of religion was Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171 (2012). The Court held that it would violate the Free Exercise Clause, as well as the Establishment Clause, to hold a religious institution liable under an antidiscrimination law for the choices it makes as to who will be its ministers. The case involved a teacher at a religious elementary school who was fired for insubordination when the school thought she might sue them under the Americans with Disability Act after she lost her job when she developed a serious illness.</p>
<p id="fc65471a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court found that holding the religious institution liable for choices it makes as to who will be its ministers infringes the Free Exercise Clause. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for a unanimous Court, distinguished Employment Division v. Smith:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc65471b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group’s right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.</p>
<p id="fc65471c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the teacher] also contend that our decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990), precludes recognition of a ministerial exception. It is true that the ADA’s prohibition on retaliation, like Oregon’s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability. But a church’s selection of its ministers is unlike an individual’s ingestion of peyote. <i>Smith</i> involved government regulation of only outward physical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself. The contention that <i>Smith</i> forecloses recognition of a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses has no merit.</p>

<p id="fc656e36-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses. In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology. We hold <span title="1701" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1701">p. 1701</span>that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc656e37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements. The student must enroll “at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington,” and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship. Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as “eligible postsecondary institution[s]” if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body. A “degree in theology” is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the State’s constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are “devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.”</p>
<p id="fc656e38-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College. Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program. Davey had “planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.” To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration. There is no dispute that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional and therefore excluded under the Promise Scholarship Program.</p>
<p id="fc656e39-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the beginning of the 1999-2000 academic year, Davey met with Northwest’s director of financial aid. He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree. He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest. He refused to sign the form and did not receive any scholarship funds.</p>
<p id="fc656e3a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment provide: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” These two Clauses, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, are frequently in tension. Yet we have long said that “there is room for play in the joints” between them. Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York (1970). In other words, there are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause.</p>
<p id="fc656e3b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves that “play in the joints” described above. Under our Establishment Clause precedent, the link between government funds and religious training is broken by the independent and private choice of recipients. See Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002). As such, there is no doubt that the State could, consistent with the Federal Constitution, permit Promise Scholars to pursue a degree in devotional theology, and the State does not contend otherwise. The question before us, however, is whether Washington, pursuant to its own constitutions,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10619_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10619_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> which has been authoritatively interpreted as prohibiting <span title="1702" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1702">p. 1702</span>even indirectly funding religious instruction that will prepare students for the ministry, can deny them such funding without violating the Free Exercise Clause.</p>
<p id="fc656e3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than that drawn by the United States Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel. In fact, we can think of few areas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into play. Since the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an “established” religion. Most States that sought to avoid an establishment of religion around the time of the founding placed in their constitutions formal prohibitions against using tax funds to support the ministry.</p>
<p id="fc65954e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Far from evincing the hostility toward religion which was manifest in <i>Lukumi</i>, we believe that the entirety of the Promise Scholarship Program goes a long way toward including religion in its benefits. The program permits students to attend pervasively religious schools, so long as they are accredited. And under the Promise Scholarship Program’s current guidelines, students are still eligible to take devotional theology courses. Davey notes all students at Northwest are required to take at least four devotional courses, and some students may have additional religious requirements as part of their majors.</p>
<p id="fc65954f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, we find neither in the history or text of Article I, §11 of the Washington Constitution, nor in the operation of the Promise Scholarship Program, anything that suggests animus towards religion. Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, we therefore cannot conclude that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect.</p>
<p id="fc659550-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Davey’s claim must fail. The State’s interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars. If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here. We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington.</p>
<p id="fc659551-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc659552-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the State makes a public benefit generally available, that benefit becomes part of the baseline against which burdens on religion are measured; and when the State withholds that benefit from some individuals solely on the basis of religion, it violates the Free Exercise Clause no less than if it had imposed a special tax. That is precisely what the State of Washington has done here. It has created a generally available public benefit, whose receipt is conditioned only on academic performance, income, and attendance at an accredited school. It has then carved out a solitary course of study for exclusion: theology. No field of study but religion is singled out for disfavor in this fashion. Davey is not asking for a special benefit to which others are not entitled. He seeks only equal treatment—the right to direct his scholarship to his chosen course of study, a right every other Promise Scholar enjoys.</p>
<p id="fc659553-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court does not dispute that the Free Exercise Clause places some constraints on public benefits programs, but finds none here, based on a principle of “play in the joints.” I use the term “principle” loosely, for that is not so much a legal principle as a refusal to apply any principle when faced with competing constitutional directives. There is nothing anomalous about constitutional <span title="1703" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1703">p. 1703</span>commands that abut. A municipality hiring public contractors may not discriminate against blacks or in favor of them; it cannot discriminate a little bit each way and then plead “play in the joints” when haled into court. If the Religion Clauses demand neutrality, we must enforce them, in hard cases as well as easy ones.</p>
<p id="fc659554-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if “play in the joints” were a valid legal principle, surely it would apply only when it was a close call whether complying with one of the Religion Clauses would violate the other. But that is not the case here.</p>
<p id="fc659555-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any case, the State already has all the play in the joints it needs. There are any number of ways it could respect both its unusually sensitive concern for the conscience of its taxpayers and the Federal Free Exercise Clause. It could make the scholarships redeemable only at public universities (where it sets the curriculum), or only for select courses of study. Either option would replace a program that facially discriminates against religion with one that just happens not to subsidize it. The State could also simply abandon the scholarship program altogether. If that seems a dear price to pay for freedom of conscience, it is only because the State has defined that freedom so broadly that it would be offended by a program with such an incidental, indirect religious effect.</p>
<p id="fc659556-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is the nature of the State’s asserted interest here? It cannot be protecting the pocketbooks of its citizens; given the tiny fraction of Promise Scholars who would pursue theology degrees, the amount of any citizen’s tax bill at stake is de minimis. It cannot be preventing mistaken appearance of endorsement; where a State merely declines to penalize students for selecting a religious major, “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw . . . an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief.” Nor can Washington’s exclusion be defended as a means of assuring that the State will neither favor nor disfavor Davey in his religious calling. Davey will throughout his life contribute to the public fisc through sales taxes on personal purchases, property taxes on his home, and so on; and nothing in the Court’s opinion turns on whether Davey winds up a net winner or loser in the State’s tax-and-spend scheme.</p>
<p id="fc659557-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No, the interest to which the Court defers is not fear of a conceivable Establishment Clause violation, budget constraints, avoidance of endorsement, or substantive neutrality—none of these. It is a pure philosophical preference: the State’s opinion that it would violate taxpayers’ freedom of conscience not to discriminate against candidates for the ministry. This sort of protection of “freedom of conscience” has no logical limit and can justify the singling out of religion for exclusion from public programs in virtually any context. The Court never says whether it deems this interest compelling (the opinion is devoid of any mention of standard of review) but, self-evidently, it is not.</p>

<p id="fc65955e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Missouri Department of Natural Resources offers state grants to help public and private schools, nonprofit daycare centers, and other nonprofit entities purchase rubber playground surfaces made from recycled tires.

<p id="fc659561-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year to serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the surrounding area. Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980, the Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates under its auspices on church property. The Center admits students of any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging from age two to five.</p>
<p id="fc659562-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Center includes a playground that is equipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings, jungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes. Almost the entire surface beneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel. Youngsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from the equipment. And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving.</p>
<p id="fc65bc73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large portion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by participating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. Run by the State’s Department of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires destined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers reimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that purchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires. It is funded through a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State.</p>
<p id="fc65bc74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Due to limited resources, the Department cannot offer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive basis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as the poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the applicant’s plan to promote recycling. When the Center applied, the Department had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity. That policy, in the Department’s view, was compelled by Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which provides: “That no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.”</p>
<p id="fc65bc75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants in the 2012 Scrap Tire Program. But despite its high score, the Center was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant. In a letter rejecting the Center’s application, the program director explained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance directly to a church.</p>
<p id="fc65bc76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as part of the 2012 program. Because the Center was operated by Trinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant.</p>

<p id="fc65bc78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the Department in Federal District Court. The Church alleged that the Department’s failure to approve the Center’s application, pursuant to its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated applicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Trinity Lutheran sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the Church on that basis in future grant applications.</p>
<p id="fc65bc79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court granted the Department’s motion to dismiss. The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the exercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion. The District Court likened the Department’s denial of the scrap tire grant to the situation this Court encountered in Locke v. Davey (2004). In that case, we upheld against a free exercise challenge the State of Washington’s decision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a state scholarship program. Finding the present case “nearly indistinguishable from <i>Locke,</i>” the District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions like Trinity Lutheran. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</p>

<p id="fc65bc7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment provides, in part, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The parties agree that the Establishment Clause of that Amendment does not prevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire Program. That does not, however, answer the question under the Free Exercise Clause, because we have recognized that there is “play in the joints” between what the Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause compels.</p>
<p id="fc65bc7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Free Exercise Clause “protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment” and subjects to the strictest scrutiny laws that target the religious for “special disabilities” based on their “religious status.” Applying that basic principle, this Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally available benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only by a state interest “of the highest order.”</p>
<p id="fc65bc7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947), for example, we upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a New Jersey law enabling a local school district to reimburse parents for the public transportation costs of sending their children to public and private schools, including parochial schools. In the course of ruling that the Establishment Clause allowed New Jersey to extend that public benefit to all its citizens regardless of their religious belief, we explained that a State “cannot hamper its citizens in the free exercise of their own religion. Consequently, it cannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the members of any other faith, <i>because of their faith, or lack of it,</i> from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.”</p>

<p id="fc65bc80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Department’s policy expressly discriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their religious character. If the cases just described make one thing clear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny. This conclusion is unremarkable in light of our prior decisions.</p>
<p id="fc65bc81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Department contends that merely declining to extend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not <i>prohibit</i> the Church from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise exercising its religious rights. Here the Department has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place. That decision does not meaningfully burden the Church’s free exercise rights. And absent any such burden, the argument continues, the Department is free to heed the State’s antiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a church.</p>
<p id="fc65bc82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true the Department has not criminalized the way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a certain view of the Gospel. But, as the Department itself acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” As the Court put it more than 50 years ago, “[i]t is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.”</p>
<p id="fc65bc83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement to a subsidy. It instead asserts a right to participate in a government benefit program without having to disavow its religious character. The “imposition of such a condition upon even a gratuitous benefit inevitably deter[s] or discourage[s] the exercise of First Amendment rights.” The express discrimination against religious exercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal to allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with secular organizations for a grant. Trinity Lutheran is a member of the community too, and the State’s decision to exclude it for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest scrutiny.</p>

<p id="fc65bc85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Department attempts to get out from under the weight of our precedents by arguing that the free exercise question in this case is instead controlled by our decision in Locke v. Davey. It is not. In <i>Locke,</i> the State of Washington created a scholarship program to assist high-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education. The scholarships were paid out of the State’s general fund, and eligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant’s score on college admission tests and family income. While scholarship recipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and non-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the funds to pursue a devotional theology degree—one “devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.” Davey was selected for a scholarship but was denied the funds when he refused to certify that he would not use them toward a devotional degree. He sued, arguing that the State’s refusal to allow its scholarship money to go toward such degrees violated his free exercise rights.</p>
<p id="fc65bc86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1707" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1707">p. 1707</span>At the outset the Court made clear that <i>Locke</i> was not like the case now before us.</p>
<p id="fc65bc87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Washington’s restriction on the use of its scholarship funds was different. According to the Court, the State had “merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.” Davey was not denied a scholarship because of who he <i>was</i>; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed <i>to do</i>—use the funds to prepare for the ministry. Here there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because of what it is—a church.</p>
<p id="fc65e398-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Locke</i> also stated that Washington’s choice was in keeping with the State’s antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for the training of clergy; in fact, the Court could “think of few areas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into play.” The claimant in <i>Locke</i> sought funding for an “essentially religious endeavor . . . akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit,” and opposition to such funding “to support church leaders” lay at the historic core of the Religion Clauses. Here nothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled tires to resurface playgrounds.</p>
<p id="fc65e399-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying on <i>Locke,</i> the Department nonetheless emphasizes Missouri’s similar constitutional tradition of not furnishing taxpayer money directly to churches. But <i>Locke</i> took account of Washington’s antiestablishment interest only after determining, as noted, that the scholarship program did not “require students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” As the Court put it, Washington’s scholarship program went “a long way toward including religion in its benefits.” Students in the program were free to use their scholarships at “pervasively religious schools.” Davey could use his scholarship to pursue a secular degree at one institution while studying devotional theology at another. He could also use his scholarship money to attend a religious college and take devotional theology courses there. The only thing he could not do was use the scholarship to pursue a degree in that subject.</p>
<p id="fc65e39a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, there is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran <i>is</i> put to the choice between being a church and receiving a government benefit. The rule is simple: No churches need apply.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1072D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1072D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">20</a></span></p>

<p id="fc65e39d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State in this case expressly requires Trinity Lutheran to renounce its religious character in order to participate in an otherwise generally available public benefit program, for which it is fully qualified. Our cases make clear that such a condition imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that must be subjected to the “most rigorous” scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fc65e39e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under that stringent standard, only a state interest “of the highest order” can justify the Department’s discriminatory policy. Yet the Department offers nothing more than Missouri’s policy preference for skating as far as possible from religious establishment concerns. In the face of the clear infringement on free exercise before us, that interest cannot qualify as compelling. As we said when considering Missouri’s same policy preference on a prior occasion, “the state interest asserted here—in achieving greater separation of church and <span title="1708" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1708">p. 1708</span>State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution—is limited by the Free Exercise Clause.”</p>
<p id="fc65e39f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State has pursued its preferred policy to the point of expressly denying a qualified religious entity a public benefit solely because of its religious character. Under our precedents, that goes too far. The Department’s policy violates the Free Exercise Clause.</p>
<p id="fc65e3a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nearly 200 years ago, a legislator urged the Maryland Assembly to adopt a bill that would end the State’s disqualification of Jews from public office: “If, on account of my religious faith, I am subjected to disqualifications, from which others are free, . . . I cannot but consider myself a persecuted man. . . . An odious exclusion from any of the benefits common to the rest of my fellow-citizens, is a persecution, differing only in degree, but of a nature equally unjustifiable with that, whose instruments are chains and torture.”</p>
<p id="fc65e3a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has not subjected anyone to chains or torture on account of religion. And the result of the State’s policy is nothing so dramatic as the denial of political office. The consequence is, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees. But the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.</p>

<p id="fc65e3a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court’s endorsement in <i>Locke</i> of even a “mil[d] kind,” <i>id.,</i> at 720, 124 S. Ct. 1307 of discrimination against religion remains troubling. But because the Court today appropriately construes <i>Locke</i> narrowly, and because no party has asked us to reconsider it, I join nearly all of the Court’s opinion. I do not, however, join footnote 3, for the reasons expressed by Justice Gorsuch.</p>

<p id="fc65e3a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Missouri’s law bars Trinity Lutheran from participating in a public benefits program only because it is a church. I agree this violates the First Amendment and I am pleased to join nearly all of the Court’s opinion. I offer only two modest qualifications.</p>
<p id="fc65e3a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the Court leaves open the possibility a useful distinction might be drawn between laws that discriminate on the basis of religious <i>status</i> and religious <i>use.</i> Respectfully, I harbor doubts about the stability of such a line. Does a religious man say grace before dinner? Or does a man begin his meal in a religious manner? Is it a religious group that built the playground? Or did a group build the playground so it might be used to advance a religious mission? The distinction blurs in much the same way the line between acts and omissions can blur when stared at too long, leaving us to ask (for example) whether the man who drowns by awaiting the incoming tide does so by act (coming upon the sea) or omission (allowing the sea to come upon him). Often enough the same facts can be described both ways.</p>
<p id="fc65e3a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither do I see why the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause should care. After all, that Clause guarantees the free <i>exercise</i> of religion, not just the right to inward belief (or status). And this Court has long explained that government may not “devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices.” Generally the government may not force people to choose between participation in a public program and their right to free exercise of religion. I don’t see why it should matter whether we describe <span title="1709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1709">p. 1709</span>that benefit, say, as closed to Lutherans (status) or closed to people who do Lutheran things (use). It is free exercise either way. For these reasons, reliance on the status-use distinction does not suffice for me to distinguish Locke v. Davey.</p>
<p id="fc660ab8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second and for similar reasons, I am unable to join the footnoted observation that “[t]his case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing.” Of course the footnote is entirely correct, but I worry that some might mistakenly read it to suggest that only “playground resurfacing” cases, or only those with some association with children’s safety or health, or perhaps some other social good we find sufficiently worthy, are governed by the legal rules recounted in and faithfully applied by the Court’s opinion. Such a reading would be unreasonable for our cases are “governed by general principles, rather than ad hoc improvisations.” And the general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else.</p>
<p id="fc660ab9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc660aba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with much of what the Court says and with its result. But I find relevant, and would emphasize, the particular nature of the “public benefit” here at issue. The Court stated in <i>Everson</i> that “cutting off church schools from” such “general government services as ordinary police and fire protection . . . is obviously not the purpose of the First Amendment.” Here, the State would cut Trinity Lutheran off from participation in a general program designed to secure or to improve the health and safety of children. I see no significant difference. The fact that the program at issue ultimately funds only a limited number of projects cannot itself justify a religious distinction. Nor is there any administrative or other reason to treat church schools differently. The sole reason advanced that explains the difference is faith. And it is that last-mentioned fact that calls the Free Exercise Clause into play. We need not go further. Public benefits come in many shapes and sizes. I would leave the application of the Free Exercise Clause to other kinds of public benefits for another day.</p>
<p id="fc660abb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc660abc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hear the Court tell it, this is a simple case about recycling tires to resurface a playground. The stakes are higher. This case is about nothing less than the relationship between religious institutions and the civil government—that is, between church and state. The Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church. Its decision slights both our precedents and our history, and its reasoning weakens this country’s longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both.</p>

<p id="fc660abe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Founded in 1922, Trinity Lutheran Church (Church) “operates . . . for the express purpose of carrying out the commission of . . . Jesus Christ as directed to His church on earth.” The Church uses “preaching, teaching, worship, witness, service, and fellowship according to the Word of God” to carry out its mission “to ‘make disciples.’” The Church’s religious beliefs include its desire to <span title="1710" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1710">p. 1710</span>“associat[e] with the [Trinity Church Child] Learning Center.” The Learning Center serves as “a ministry of the Church and incorporates daily religion and developmentally appropriate activities into . . . [its] program.” In this way, “[t]hrough the Learning Center, the Church teaches a Christian world view to children of members of the Church, as well as children of non-member residents” of the area. These activities represent the Church’s “sincere religious belief . . . to use [the Learning Center] to teach the Gospel to children of its members, as well to bring the Gospel message to non-members.”</p>

<p id="fc660ac0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Properly understood then, this is a case about whether Missouri can decline to fund improvements to the facilities the Church uses to practice and spread its religious views. This Court has repeatedly warned that funding of exactly this kind—payments from the government to a house of worship—would cross the line drawn by the Establishment Clause. So it is surprising that the Court mentions the Establishment Clause only to note the parties’ agreement that it “does not prevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire Program.” Constitutional questions are decided by this Court, not the parties’ concessions. The Establishment Clause does not allow Missouri to grant the Church’s funding request because the Church uses the Learning Center, including its playground, in conjunction with its religious mission. The Court’s silence on this front signals either its misunderstanding of the facts of this case or a startling departure from our precedents.</p>
<p id="fc660ac1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government may not directly fund religious exercise. Nowhere is this rule more clearly implicated than when funds flow directly from the public treasury to a house of worship. A house of worship exists to foster and further religious exercise. When a government funds a house of worship, it underwrites this religious exercise.</p>
<p id="fc660ac2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is no different. The Church seeks state funds to improve the Learning Center’s facilities, which, by the Church’s own avowed description, are used to assist the spiritual growth of the children of its members and to spread the Church’s faith to the children of nonmembers. The Church’s playground surface—like a Sunday School room’s walls or the sanctuary’s pews—are integrated with and integral to its religious mission. The conclusion that the funding the Church seeks would impermissibly advance religion is inescapable.</p>
<p id="fc660ac3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, this Court has found some direct government funding of religious institutions to be consistent with the Establishment Clause. But the funding in those cases came with assurances that public funds would not be used for religious activity, despite the religious nature of the institution. The Church has not and cannot provide such assurances here. The Church has a religious mission, one that it pursues through the Learning Center. The playground surface cannot be confined to secular use any more than lumber used to frame the Church’s walls, glass stained and used to form its windows, or nails used to build its altar.</p>
<p id="fc660ac4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court may simply disagree with this account of the facts and think that the Church does not put its playground to religious use. If so, its mistake is limited to this case. But if it agrees that the State’s funding would further religious activity and sees no Establishment Clause problem, then it must be implicitly applying a rule other than the one agreed to in our precedents.</p>
<p id="fc660ac5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1711">p. 1711</span>When the Court last addressed direct funding of religious institutions, in <i>Mitchell,</i> it adhered to the rule that the Establishment Clause prohibits the direct funding of religious activities.</p>
<p id="fc660ac6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s opinion suggests the Court has made the leap the <i>Mitchell</i> plurality could not. For if it agrees that the funding here will finance religious activities, then only a rule that considers that fact irrelevant could support a conclusion of constitutionality. It has no basis in the history to which the Court has repeatedly turned to inform its understanding of the Establishment Clause. It permits direct subsidies for religious indoctrination, with all the attendant concerns that led to the Establishment Clause. And it favors certain religious groups, those with a belief system that allows them to compete for public dollars and those well-organized and well-funded enough to do so successfully.</p>
<p id="fc660ac7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such a break with precedent would mark a radical mistake. The Establishment Clause protects both religion and government from the dangers that result when the two become entwined, “<i>not</i> by providing every religion with an <i>equal opportunity</i> (say, to secure state funding or to pray in the public schools), but by drawing fairly clear lines of <i>separation</i> between church and state—at least where the heartland of religious belief, such as primary religious [worship], is at issue.”</p>

<p id="fc6631d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming the absence of an Establishment Clause violation and proceeding on the Court’s preferred front—the Free Exercise Clause—the Court errs. It claims that the government may not draw lines based on an entity’s religious “status.” But we have repeatedly said that it can. When confronted with government action that draws such a line, we have carefully considered whether the interests embodied in the Religion Clauses justify that line. The question here is thus whether those interests support the line drawn in Missouri’s Article I, §7, separating the State’s treasury from those of houses of worship. They unquestionably do.</p>
<p id="fc6631da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion” and the Free Exercise Clause prohibits laws “prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” “[I]f expanded to a logical extreme,” these prohibitions “would tend to clash with the other.” Even in the absence of a violation of one of the Religion Clauses, the interaction of government and religion can raise concerns that sound in both Clauses. For that reason, the government may sometimes act to accommodate those concerns, even when not required to do so by the Free Exercise Clause, without violating the Establishment Clause. And the government may sometimes act to accommodate those concerns, even when not required to do so by the Establishment Clause, without violating the Free Exercise Clause. “[T]here is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.” This space between the two Clauses gives government some room to recognize the unique status of religious entities and to single them out on that basis for exclusion from otherwise generally applicable laws.</p>
<p id="fc6631db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Invoking this principle, this Court has held that the government may sometimes relieve religious entities from the requirements of government programs. A State need not, for example, require nonprofit houses of worship to pay property taxes. Nor must a State require nonprofit religious entities to abstain from <span title="1712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1712">p. 1712</span>making employment decisions on the basis of religion. But the government may not invoke the space between the Religion Clauses in a manner that “devolve[s] into an unlawful fostering of religion.”</p>
<p id="fc6631dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Missouri has decided that the unique status of houses of worship requires a special rule when it comes to public funds. Its Constitution reflects that choice and provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc6631dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“That no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect, or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.” Art. I, §7.</p>
</div>
<p id="fc6631de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Missouri’s decision, which has deep roots in our Nation’s history, reflects a reasonable and constitutional judgment.</p>
<p id="fc6631df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has consistently looked to history for guidance when applying the Constitution’s Religion Clauses. Those Clauses guard against a return to the past, and so that past properly informs their meaning. This case is no different.</p>
<p id="fc6631e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who fought to end the public funding of religion based their opposition on a powerful set of arguments, all stemming from the basic premise that the practice harmed both civil government and religion. The civil government, they maintained, could claim no authority over religious belief. For them, support for religion compelled by the State marked an overstep of authority that would only lead to more. Equally troubling, it risked divisiveness by giving religions reason to compete for the State’s beneficence. Faith, they believed, was a personal matter, entirely between an individual and his god. Religion was best served when sects reached out on the basis of their tenets alone, unsullied by outside forces, allowing adherents to come to their faith voluntarily. Over and over, these arguments gained acceptance and led to the end of state laws exacting payment for the support of religion.</p>
<p id="fc6631e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Locke,</i> this Court expressed an understanding of, and respect for, this history.</p>
<p id="fc6631e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same is true of this case, about directing taxpayer funds to houses of worship. Like the use of public dollars for ministers at issue in <i>Locke,</i> turning over public funds to houses of worship implicates serious antiestablishment and free exercise interests. The history just discussed fully supports this conclusion. As states disestablished, they repealed laws allowing taxation to support religion because the practice threatened other forms of government support for, involved some government control over, and weakened supporters’ control of religion. Common sense also supports this conclusion. Recall that a state may not fund religious activities without violating the Establishment Clause. A state can reasonably use status as a “house of worship” as a stand-in for “religious activities.” Inside a house of worship, dividing the religious from the secular would require intrusive line-drawing by government, and monitoring those lines would entangle government with the house of worship’s activities. And so while not every activity a house of worship undertakes will be inseparably linked to religious activity, “the likelihood that many are makes a categorical rule a suitable means to avoid chilling the exercise of religion.” Finally, and of course, such funding implicates the free exercise rights of taxpayers by denying them the chance to decide for themselves whether and how to fund religion. <span title="1713" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1713">p. 1713</span>If there is any “‘room for play in the joints’ between” the Religion Clauses, it is here.</p>
<p id="fc6631e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As was true in <i>Locke,</i> a prophylactic rule against the use of public funds for houses of worship is a permissible accommodation of these weighty interests. The rule has a historical pedigree identical to that of the provision in <i>Locke</i>. Today, thirty-eight States have a counterpart to Missouri’s Article I, §7. The provisions, as a general matter, date back to or before these States’ original Constitutions. That so many States have for so long drawn a line that prohibits public funding for houses of worship, based on principles rooted in this Nation’s understanding of how best to foster religious liberty, supports the conclusion that public funding of houses of worship “is of a different ilk.”</p>
<p id="fc6631e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Missouri has recognized the simple truth that, even absent an Establishment Clause violation, the transfer of public funds to houses of worship raises concerns that sit exactly between the Religion Clauses. To avoid those concerns, and only those concerns, it has prohibited such funding. In doing so, it made the same choice made by the earliest States centuries ago and many other States in the years since. The Constitution permits this choice.</p>
<p id="fc6631e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Court’s view, none of this matters. It focuses on one aspect of Missouri’s Article I, §7, to the exclusion of all else: that it denies funding to a house of worship, here the Church, “simply because of what it [i]s—a church.”</p>
<p id="fc6631e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start where the Court stays silent. Its opinion does not acknowledge that our precedents have expressly approved of a government’s choice to draw lines based on an entity’s religious status. Those cases did not deploy strict scrutiny to create a presumption of unconstitutionality, as the Court does today. Instead, they asked whether the government had offered a strong enough reason to justify drawing a line based on that status.</p>
<p id="fc6631e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court takes two steps to avoid these precedents. First, it recasts <i>Locke</i> as a case about a restriction that prohibited the would-be minister from “us[ing] the funds to prepare for the ministry.” A faithful reading of <i>Locke</i> gives it a broader reach. <i>Locke</i> stands for the reasonable proposition that the government may, but need not, choose not to fund certain religious entities (there, ministers) where doing so raises “historic and substantial” establishment and free exercise concerns.</p>
<p id="fc6631e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, it suggests that this case is different because it involves “discrimination” in the form of the denial of access to a possible benefit. But in this area of law, a decision to treat entities differently based on distinctions that the Religion Clauses make relevant does not amount to discrimination. To understand why, keep in mind that “the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.” If the denial of a benefit others may receive is discrimination that violates the Free Exercise Clause, then the accommodations of religious entities we have approved would violate the free exercise rights of nonreligious entities. We have, with good reason, rejected that idea and instead focused on whether the government has provided a good enough reason, based in the values the Religion Clauses protect, for its decision.</p>
<p id="fc6631e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court offers no real reason for rejecting the balancing approach in our precedents in favor of strict scrutiny, beyond its references to discrimination. The Court’s desire to avoid what it views as discrimination is understandable. But in this context, the description is particularly inappropriate. A State’s decision not to fund houses of worship does not disfavor religion; rather, it represents <span title="1714" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1714">p. 1714</span>a valid choice to remain secular in the face of serious establishment and free exercise concerns. That does not make the State “atheistic or antireligious.” The Court’s conclusion “that the only alternative to governmental support of religion is governmental hostility to it represents a giant step backward in our Religion Clause jurisprudence.”</p>
<p id="fc6658fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At bottom, the Court creates the following rule today: The government may draw lines on the basis of religious status to grant a benefit to religious persons or entities but it may not draw lines on that basis when doing so would further the interests the Religion Clauses protect in other ways. Nothing supports this lopsided outcome. Not the Religion Clauses, as they protect establishment and free exercise interests in the same constitutional breath, neither privileged over the other. Not precedent, since we have repeatedly explained that the Clauses protect not religion but “the individual’s freedom of conscience,” —that which allows him to choose religion, reject it, or remain undecided. And not reason, because as this case shows, the same interests served by lifting government-imposed burdens on certain religious entities may sometimes be equally served by denying government-provided benefits to certain religious entities.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10859_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10859_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">21</a></span> Today’s decision discounts centuries of history and jeopardizes the government’s ability to remain secular.</p>

<p id="fc6658fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today dismantles a core protection for religious freedom provided in these Clauses. It holds not just that a government may support houses of worship with taxpayer funds, but that—at least in this case and perhaps in others, it must do so whenever it decides to create a funding program. History shows that the Religion Clauses separate the public treasury from religious coffers as one measure to secure the kind of freedom of conscience that benefits both religion and government. If this separation means anything, it means that the government cannot, or at the very least need not, tax its citizens and turn that money over to houses of worship. The Court today blinds itself to the outcome this history requires and leads us instead to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.</p>

<p id="fc665901-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993, 42 U.S.C. §2000bb, was adopted to negate the <i>Smith</i> test and require strict scrutiny for Free Exercise Clause claims. The act declares that its purpose is “to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder, and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.” In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), the Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments. Boerne, which is presented in Chapter 2, held that Congress lacked the authority under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to expand the scope of rights and that RFRA was thus unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments.</p>
<p id="fc665902-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has never expressly upheld the constitutionality of RFRA as applied to the federal government. However, in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Unia Do, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), the Supreme Court applied the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to the federal government. Although the Court did not expressly address the issue of whether the statute is constitutional as applied to the federal government, the Court did use the act to rule in favor of a religion and against the federal government. The case involved a small religion, with relatively few adherents in the United States, whose members receive communion by drinking hoasca, a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon rainforest that contains a hallucinogen regulated under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Members of the religion brought a suit seeking a declaratory judgment that their use of the tea was protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p>
<p id="fc665903-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Roberts wrote for a unanimous Court and ruled in favor of the religion. In response to the government’s claim of a need to stop the availability of hallucinogenic drugs, the Court stated, “RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened. RFRA expressly adopted the compelling interest test ‘as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972).’ In each of those cases, this Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.”</p>
<p id="fc665904-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying this test, the Court concluded, “Under the more focused inquiry required by RFRA and the compelling interest test, the Government’s mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances, as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, cannot carry the day. It is true, of course, that Schedule I substances are exceptionally dangerous. Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue here—the circumscribed, sacramental use of hoasca by [this religion].”</p>
<p id="fc665905-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case indicates that RFRA is applicable to the federal government and that the Court approves a rigorous application of strict scrutiny under the statute.</p>
<p id="fc665906-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This also was clear from the Supreme Court’s subsequent, and undoubtedly most important, decision concerning RFRA: Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. 682 (2014). The Court held that it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration <span title="1716" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1716">p. 1716</span>Act to require that a closely held corporation provide insurance coverage for contraceptives that violates its owners’ religious beliefs. A federal law required that the Department of Health and Human Services promulgate regulations requiring that health insurance provided by employers include preventative health care coverage for women. These regulations mandate that employer-provided insurance include contraceptive coverage for women. Although religious institutions and nonprofit corporations affiliated with religious institutions may exempt themselves from this requirement, for-profit companies must comply.</p>
<p id="fc665907-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that it violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act to require a closely held for-profit corporation to provide coverage for contraceptives that it says violate the religious beliefs of its owners. Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion. The Court said that Congress “included corporations within RFRA’s definition of ‘persons.’” The Court held that corporations can claim to have religious beliefs and religious free exercise. It stated: “A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. . . . When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.”</p>
<p id="fc665908-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that it had “little trouble concluding” that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened the religious beliefs of owners of closely held corporations who opposed certain contraceptives. The Court said that it would assume that the government has a compelling interest in ensuring the availability of contraceptives for women, but that there were less restrictive alternatives: Congress could directly pay for these contraceptives or Congress could allow for-profit companies the same ability to opt out that it had given to not-for-profit companies that are affiliated with religions that oppose contraception. The Court thus concluded that “[t]he contraceptive mandate, as applied to closely held corporations, violates RFRA.”</p>
<p id="fc665909-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg wrote a vigorous dissent, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, and disagreed with every aspect of the majority’s opinion. The dissent disagreed that for-profit corporations can have religious beliefs or religious free exercise and stated that “until today, religious exemptions had never been extended to any entity operating in the commercial, profit-making world.” The dissent also disagreed that there is a substantial burdening of religious belief from requiring employers to provide insurance that includes coverage for contraceptives. Justice Ginsburg wrote: “The requirement carries no command that Hobby Lobby or Conestoga purchase or provide the contraceptives they find objectionable. Instead, it calls on the companies covered by the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated funds that finance a wide variety of benefits under comprehensive health plans. . . . Any decision to use contraceptives made by a woman covered under Hobby Lobby’s or Conestoga’s plan will not be propelled by the Government, it will be the woman’s autonomous choice, informed by the physician she consults.”</p>
<p id="fc66590a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent also disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that there are less restrictive alternatives. Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion stressed that this will open the door to other claims under RFRA for an exemption to providing health insurance coverage. She wrote: “Would the exemption the Court holds RFRA demands for employers with religiously grounded objections to the use of certain contraceptives extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and <span title="1717" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1717">p. 1717</span>pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian Scientists, among others)?”</p>
<p id="fc66590b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent was concerned, too, that this could lead to claims for religious exemptions to other federal laws, such as antidiscrimination statutes. The majority opinion responded to this by denying this possibility because “[t]he Government has a compelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal. . . .”</p>

<p id="fc66801f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decisions recognize that “there is room for play in the joints” between the Clauses, some space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause. In accord with the majority of Courts of Appeals that have ruled on the question, we hold that §3 of RLUIPA fits within the corridor between the Religion Clauses: On its face, the Act qualifies as a permissible legislative accommodation of religion that is not barred by the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p id="fc668025-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three major competing approaches to the Establishment Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108EB_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N108EB_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> Each has adherents on the Court, and each is supported by a body of scholarly literature.

<p id="fc668029-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first theory often is termed “strict separation.” This approach says that to the greatest extent possible, government and religion should be separated. The government should be, as much as possible, secular; religion should be entirely in the private realm of society. This theory is perhaps best described by Thomas Jefferson’s metaphor that there should be a wall separating church and state.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108FE_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N108FE_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> As the Supreme Court declared in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), “The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable.”</p>
<p id="fc66802b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jefferson’s famous words were uttered, as was Madison’s Remonstrance, as part of a campaign against Virginia’s renewing its tax to support the church. In <i>Everson</i>, Justice Rutledge reviewed this history in describing the philosophy underlying the Establishment Clause: “The Amendment’s purpose was not to strike merely at the official establishment of a single sect, creed or religion, outlawing only a formal relation such as had prevailed in England and some of the colonies. Necessarily it was to uproot all such relationships. But the object was broader than separating church and state in this narrow sense. It was to create a complete and permanent separation of the spheres of religious activity and civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion.”</p>
<p id="fc66802c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A strict separation of church and state is seen as necessary to protect religious liberty.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10912_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10912_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span> When religion becomes a part of government, separationists argue, there is inevitable coercion to participate in that faith. Those of different faiths and those who profess no religious beliefs are made to feel excluded and unwelcome when government and religion become intertwined. Moreover, government involvement with religion is inherently divisive in a country with so many different religions and many people who claim no religion at all.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1091D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1091D_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span></p>
<p id="fc668031-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are problems with the strict separation approach, as there are with all of the theories. A complete prohibition of all government assistance to religion would threaten the free exercise of religion. For example, a refusal by the government to provide police, fire, or sanitation services obviously would seemingly infringe free exercise. Thus, a total wall separating church and state is impossible, and the issue becomes how to draw the appropriate line. Moreover, religion <span title="1719" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1719">p. 1719</span>has traditionally been a part of many government activities, from the phrase “In God We Trust” on coins to the invocation before Supreme Court session, “God save this honorable Court.”</p>

<p id="fc668034-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second major approach to the Establishment Clause says that the government must be neutral on religion; that is, the government cannot favor religion over secularism or one religion over others. Professor Philip Kurland, a key exponent of this approach to the Religion Clauses, wrote that “the clauses should be read as stating a single precept: that government cannot utilize religion as a standard for action or inaction because these clauses, read together as they should be, prohibit classification in terms of religion either to confer a benefit or to impose a burden.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10940_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10940_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> Professor Douglas Laycock has said that substantive neutrality means that “the religion clauses require government to minimize the extent to which it either encourages or discourages religious belief or disbelief, practice or nonpractice, observance or nonobservance.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10949_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10949_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span></p>
<p id="fc668037-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several Supreme Court justices have advanced an “endorsement” test in evaluating the neutrality of a government’s action. Under this approach, the government violates the Establishment Clause if it symbolically endorses a particular religion or if it generally endorses either religion or secularism. For example, Justice O’Connor has written that “[e]very government practice must be judged in its unique circumstances to determine whether it constitutes an endorsement or disapproval of religion.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10955_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10955_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span></p>
<p id="fc66a749-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor explained the importance of such government neutrality: “As a theoretical matter, the endorsement test captures the essential command of the Establishment Clause, namely, that government must not make a person’s religious beliefs relevant to his or her standing in the political community by conveying a message ‘that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.’ . . . If government is to be neutral in matters of religion, rather than showing either favoritism or disapproval towards citizens based on their personal religious choices, government cannot endorse the religious practices and beliefs of some citizens without sending a clear message to nonadherents that they are outsiders or less than full members of the political community.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1095E_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1095E_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span></p>
<p id="fc66a74b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty is in determining what government actions constitute an “endorsement” of religion. Several justices discussed this in Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Board v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753 (1995). The issue in <i>Pinette</i> was whether it was unconstitutional for the government to preclude the Ku Klux Klan from erecting a large Latin cross in the park across from the Ohio Statehouse. Although there was no majority opinion for the Court, seven justices voted that excluding the cross violated the Klan’s free speech rights and that allowing it to be present would not violate the Establishment Clause. In the <span title="1720" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1720">p. 1720</span>course of the Establishment Clause discussion, several of the justices addressed what constitutes a symbolic endorsement.</p>
<p id="fc66a74c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor, in an opinion concurring in the judgment joined by Justices Souter and Breyer, concluded that the cross should be allowed because the reasonable observer would not perceive it as an endorsement of religion. O’Connor said that “[w]here the government’s operation of a public forum has the effect of endorsing religion, even if the governmental actor neither intends nor actively encourages that result, the Establishment Clause is violated.” Justice O’Connor said that a reasonable observer would not likely perceive the cross as being endorsed by the government because there was “a sign disclaiming government sponsorship or endorsement” and this would “remove doubt about State approval of [the] religious message.”</p>
<p id="fc66a74d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">O’Connor said that the endorsement test is applied “from the perspective of a hypothetical observer who is presumed to possess a certain level of information that all citizens might not share.” She said that the reasonable observer “must be deemed aware of the history and content of the community and forum in which the religious display appears [and] the general history of the place in which the cross is displayed. [An] informed observer will know how the public space in question has been used in the past.”</p>
<p id="fc66a74e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Stevens and Ginsburg dissented and argued that endorsement exists if a reasonable person passing by would perceive government support for religion. Justice Stevens wrote, “If a reasonable person could perceive a government endorsement of religion from a private display, then the State may not allow its property to be used as a forum for that display. No less stringent rule can adequately protect non-adherents from a well-grounded perception that their sovereign supports a faith to which they do not subscribe.” Justice Stevens argued that Justice O’Connor’s “‘reasonable person’ comes off as a well-schooled jurist, a being finer than the tort-law model. . . . [T]his enhanced tort-law standard is singularly out of place in the Establishment Clause context. It strips of constitutional protection every person whose knowledge happens to fall below some ‘ideal’ standard.”</p>
<p id="fc66a74f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, three different approaches to the endorsement test were expressed in <i>Pinette</i>. Justice Scalia, writing for the plurality, rejected using the test at all where the issue is private speech on government property. Justice O’Connor, writing for herself and Justices Souter and Breyer, said that the symbolic endorsement test should be applied from the perspective of the perceptions of a well-educated and well-informed observer. Justice Stevens, dissenting and joined by Justice Ginsburg, said that the symbolic endorsement test should look to the perceptions of the reasonable passerby.</p>
<p id="fc66a750-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The endorsement test is defended as a desirable approach to the Establishment Clause because it is a way of determining whether the government is neutral or whether it is favoring religion. A key purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prevent the government from making those who are not a part of the favored religion from feeling unwelcome. The symbolic endorsement test is seen as a way of assessing the likely perceptions of and reactions to government conduct.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10983_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10983_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span></p>
<p id="fc66a752-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1721" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1721">p. 1721</span>Those who criticize the endorsement test often focus on its ambiguity and indeterminancy.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10996_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10996_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span> People will perceive symbols in widely varying ways. The Court inevitably is left to make a subjective choice as to how people will perceive a particular symbol. Moreover, judges who are part of the dominant religion may be insensitive to how those of minority religions perceive particular symbols. At the same time, some argue that the endorsement test is too restrictive of government involvement with religion. Justice Kennedy, for example, said, “Either the endorsement test must invalidate scores of traditional practices recognizing the place religion holds in our culture, or it must be twisted and stretched to avoid inconsistency with practices we know to have been permitted in the past, while condemning similar practices with no greater endorsement effect simply by reason of their lack of historical antecedent. Neither result is acceptable.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109A7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109A7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">32</a></span></p>

<p id="fc66a757-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third major theory is termed an “accommodation” approach. Under this view, the Court should interpret the Establishment Clause to recognize the importance of religion in society and accommodate its presence in government. Specifically, under the accommodation approach the government violates the Establishment Clause only if it literally establishes a church or coerces religious participation. Justice Kennedy, for example, has said that “the Establishment Clause . . . guarantees at a minimum that a government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109B9_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109B9_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span> In fact, wrote Justice Kennedy, “[b]arring all attempts to aid religion through government coercion goes far toward the attainment of [the] object [of the Establishment Clause].”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109BF_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109BF_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">34</a></span></p>
<p id="fc66a75a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key question under this approach concerns what constitutes government “coercion.” Several justices discussed this in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992), presented below, where the Court declared unconstitutional clergy-delivered prayers at public school graduations. Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, found that such prayers are inherently coercive because there is great pressure on students to attend their graduation ceremonies and to not leave during the prayers.</p>
<p id="fc66a75b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Blackmun, in an opinion joined by Justices Stevens and O’Connor, wrote to emphasize that the Establishment Clause can be violated even without coercion. He remarked that it “is not enough that the government refrain from compelling religious practices; it must not engage in them either.” Likewise, Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens and O’Connor, wrote separately to stress that coercion is sufficient for a finding of Establishment Clause violation, <span title="1722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1722">p. 1722</span>but it is not necessary; Establishment Clause violations exist without coercion if there is symbolic government endorsement of religion.</p>
<p id="fc66a75c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissenting opinion by Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Thomas, advocated the accommodation approach, but defined coercion much more narrowly than Justice Kennedy. Justice Scalia said that “[t]he coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty.” In other words, for the dissenters in <i>Lee</i>, coercion exists only if the law requires and punishes the failure to engage in religious practices.</p>
<p id="fc66a75d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a subsequent case, presented below, Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Justice Thomas in a concurring opinion joined in relevant part by Justice Scalia, said that coercion must be legal coercion enforced by penalty of law: “‘The coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support <i>by force of law and threat of penalty</i>.’ Thus, to the extent coercion is relevant to the Establishment Clause analysis, it is actual legal coercion that counts—not the ‘subtle coercive pressures.’ [I]n light of the foregoing history of the Establishment Clause, ‘[p]eer pressure, unpleasant as it may be, is not coercion’ either.”</p>
<p id="fc66a75e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who defend the accommodation approach argue that it best reflects the importance and prevalence of religion in American society. Professor Michael McConnell, an advocate of this view, said that it is desirable because it makes “religion . . . a welcome element in the mix of beliefs and associations present in the community. Under this view, the emphasis is placed on freedom of choice and diversity among religious opinion. The nation is understood not as secular but as pluralistic. Religion is under no special disability in public life; indeed, it is at least as protected and encouraged as any other form of belief and association—in some ways more so.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109E0_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109E0_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span> Anything less than accommodation, it is argued, is unacceptable hostility to religion.</p>
<p id="fc66a760-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Opponents of the accommodation approach argue that, especially as defined by Justice Scalia, little ever will violate the Establishment Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109ED_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N109ED_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span> Nothing except the government creating its own church or by force of law requiring religious practices or discriminating among religions will offend the provision. Those disagreeing with this theory argue that the Establishment Clause also should serve to prevent the government from making those of other religions feel unwelcome and to keep the government from using its power and influence to advance religion or a particular religion. Justice O’Connor expressed this view when she wrote, “An Establishment Clause standard that prohibits only ‘coercive’ practices or overt efforts at government proselytization, but fails to take account of the numerous more subtle ways that government can show favoritism to particular beliefs or convey a message of disapproval to others, would not, in my view, adequately protect the religious liberty or respect the religious diversity of the members of our pluralistic political community. Thus, this Court has never relied on coercion alone as the touchstone of Establishment Clause analysis.”</p>

<p id="fc66ce7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> announced the judgment of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc66ce7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This litigation concerns the constitutionality of two recurring holiday displays located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh. The first is a creche placed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse. The second is a Chanukah menorah placed just outside the City-County Building, next to a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that each display violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because each has the impermissible effect of endorsing religion. We agree that the creche display has that unconstitutional effect but reverse the Court of Appeals’ judgment regarding the menorah display.</p>
<p id="fc66ce7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of adjudicating specific cases, this Court has come to understand the Establishment Clause to mean that government may not promote or affiliate itself with any religious doctrine or organization, may not discriminate among persons on the basis of their religious beliefs and practices, may not delegate a governmental power to a religious institution, and may not involve itself too deeply in such an institution’s affairs. Our subsequent decisions further have refined the definition of governmental action that unconstitutionally advances religion. In recent years, we have paid particularly close attention to whether the challenged governmental practice either has the purpose or effect of “endorsing” religion, a concern that has long had a place in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence. Of course, the word “endorsement” is not self-defining. Rather, it derives its meaning from other words that this Court has found useful over the years in interpreting the Establishment Clause. Thus, it has been noted that the prohibition against governmental endorsement of religion “preclude[s] government from conveying or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.” Whether the key word is “endorsement,” “favoritism,” or “promotion,” the essential principle remains the same.</p>
<p id="fc66ce7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have had occasion in the past to apply Establishment Clause principles to the government’s display of objects with religious significance. In Lynch v. Donnelly, we considered whether the city of Pawtucket, R.I., had violated the Establishment Clause by including a creche in its annual Christmas display, located in a private park within the downtown shopping district. By a 5-to-4 decision in that difficult case, the Court upheld inclusion of the creche in the Pawtucket display, holding that the inclusion of the creche did not have the impermissible effect of advancing or promoting religion. The five Justices in concurrence and dissent in <i>Lynch</i> agreed upon the relevant constitutional principles: the government’s use <span title="1724" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1724">p. 1724</span>of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government’s use of religious symbolism depends upon its context. These general principles are sound, and have been adopted by the Court in subsequent cases. Since <i>Lynch</i>, the Court has made clear that, when evaluating the effect of government conduct under the Establishment Clause, we must ascertain whether “the challenged governmental action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices.”</p>
<p id="fc66ce7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn first to the county’s creche display. There is no doubt, of course, that the creche itself is capable of communicating a religious message. Under the Court’s holding in <i>Lynch</i>, the effect of a creche display turns on its setting. Here, unlike in <i>Lynch</i>, nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche’s religious message. The <i>Lynch</i> display composed a series of figures and objects, each group of which had its own focal point. Santa’s house and his reindeer were objects of attention separate from the creche, and had their specific visual story to tell. Similarly, whatever a “talking” wishing well may be, it obviously was a center of attention separate from the creche. Here, in contrast, the creche stands alone: it is the single element of the display on the Grand Staircase.</p>
<p id="fc66ce7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The display of the Chanukah menorah in front of the City-County Building may well present a closer constitutional question. The menorah, one must recognize, is a religious symbol: it serves to commemorate the miracle of the oil as described in the Talmud. But the menorah’s message is not exclusively religious. The menorah is the primary visual symbol for a holiday that, like Christmas, has both religious and secular dimensions.</p>
<p id="fc66ce80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he menorah here stands next to a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty. While no challenge has been made here to the display of the tree and the sign, their presence is obviously relevant in determining the effect of the menorah’s display. The necessary result of placing a menorah next to a Christmas tree is to create an “overall holiday setting” that represents both Christmas and Chanukah—two holidays, not one. The mere fact that Pittsburgh displays symbols of both Christmas and Chanukah does not end the constitutional inquiry. If the city celebrates both Christmas and Chanukah as religious holidays, then it violates the Establishment Clause. The simultaneous endorsement of Judaism and Christianity is no less constitutionally infirm than the endorsement of Christianity alone.</p>
<p id="fc66ce81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the relevant question for Establishment Clause purposes is whether the combined display of the tree, the sign, and the menorah has the effect of endorsing both Christian and Jewish faiths, or rather simply recognizes that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter-holiday season, which has attained a secular status in our society. Of the two interpretations of this particular display, the latter seems far more plausible and is also in line with <i>Lynch</i>.</p>
<p id="fc66ce82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span> concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc66ce83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree that the creche displayed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, the seat of county government, conveys a message to nonadherents of Christianity that they are not full members of the political community, and a corresponding message to Christians that they are favored members of the political community. In contrast to the creche in <i>Lynch</i>, which was displayed in a private park in the city’s commercial district as part of a broader display of traditional secular symbols of the holiday season, this creche stands alone in the county courthouse. The display of religious symbols in public <span title="1725" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1725">p. 1725</span>areas of core government buildings runs a special risk of “mak[ing] religion relevant, in reality or public perception, to status in the political community.” The Court correctly concludes that placement of the central religious symbol of the Christmas holiday season at the Allegheny County Courthouse has the unconstitutional effect of conveying a government endorsement of Christianity.</p>
<p id="fc66ce84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For reasons which differ somewhat from those set forth in Justice Blackmun’s opinion, I also conclude that the city of Pittsburgh’s combined holiday display of a Chanukah menorah, a Christmas tree, and a sign saluting liberty does not have the effect of conveying an endorsement of religion. In my view, the relevant question for Establishment Clause purposes is whether the city of Pittsburgh’s display of the menorah, the religious symbol of a religious holiday, next to a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty sends a message of government endorsement of Judaism or whether it sends a message of pluralism and freedom to choose one’s own beliefs. The message of pluralism conveyed by the city’s combined holiday display is not a message that endorses religion over nonreligion.</p>

<p id="fc66ce86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I continue to believe that the display of an object that “retains a specifically Christian [or other] religious meaning” is incompatible with the separation of church and state demanded by our Constitution. I therefore agree with the Court that Allegheny County’s display of a creche at the county courthouse signals an endorsement of the Christian faith in violation of the Establishment Clause. Court’s opinion. I cannot agree, however, that the city’s display of a 45-foot Christmas tree and an 18-foot Chanukah menorah at the entrance to the building housing the mayor’s office shows no favoritism towards Christianity, Judaism, or both. Indeed, I should have thought that the answer as to the first display supplied the answer to the second.</p>
<p id="fc66ce87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="fc66f598-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion the Establishment Clause should be construed to create a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property. There is always a risk that such symbols will offend nonmembers of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular advertisement disrespectful. Some devout Christians believe that the creche should be placed only in reverential settings, such as a church or perhaps a private home; they do not countenance its use as an aid to commercialization of Christ’s birthday. In this very suit, members of the Jewish faith firmly opposed the use to which the menorah was put by the particular sect that sponsored the display at Pittsburgh’s City-County Building. Even though “[p]assersby who disagree with the message conveyed by these displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their backs,” displays of this kind inevitably have a greater tendency to emphasize sincere and deeply felt differences among individuals than to achieve an ecumenical goal. The Establishment Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement.</p>

<p id="fc66f59a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1726" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1726">p. 1726</span>The majority holds that the County of Allegheny violated the Establishment Clause by displaying a creche in the county courthouse, because the “principal or primary effect” of the display is to advance religion. This view of the Establishment Clause reflects an unjustified hostility toward religion, a hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents, and I dissent from this holding. The creche display is constitutional, and, for the same reasons, the display of a menorah by the city of Pittsburgh is permissible as well. On this latter point, I concur in the result, but not the reasoning, of Justice Blackmun’s opinion.</p>
<p id="fc66f59b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather than requiring government to avoid any action that acknowledges or aids religion, the Establishment Clause permits government some latitude in recognizing and accommodating the central role religion plays in our society. Any approach less sensitive to our heritage would border on latent hostility toward religion, as it would require government in all its multifaceted roles to acknowledge only the secular, to the exclusion and so to the detriment of the religious. A categorical approach would install federal courts as jealous guardians of an absolute “wall of separation,” sending a clear message of disapproval. In this century, as the modern administrative state expands to touch the lives of its citizens in such diverse ways and redirects their financial choices through programs of its own, it is difficult to maintain the fiction that requiring government to avoid all assistance to religion can in fairness be viewed as serving the goal of neutrality.</p>
<p id="fc66f59c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ability of the organized community to recognize and accommodate religion in a society with a pervasive public sector requires diligent observance of the border between accommodation and establishment. Our cases disclose two limiting principles: government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in any religion or its exercise; and it may not, in the guise of avoiding hostility or callous indifference, give direct benefits to religion in such a degree that it in fact “establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.”</p>
<p id="fc66f59d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles are not difficult to apply to the facts of the cases before us. In permitting the displays on government property of the menorah and the creche, the city and county sought to do no more than “celebrate the season,” and to acknowledge, along with many of their citizens, the historical background and the religious, as well as secular, nature of the Chanukah and Christmas holidays. This interest falls well within the tradition of government accommodation and acknowledgment of religion that has marked our history from the beginning. It cannot be disputed that government, if it chooses, may participate in sharing with its citizens the joy of the holiday season, by declaring public holidays, installing or permitting festive displays, sponsoring celebrations and parades, and providing holiday vacations for its employees. All levels of our government do precisely that. As we said in <i>Lynch</i>, “Government has long recognized—indeed it has subsidized—holidays with religious significance.”</p>
<p id="fc66f59e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If government is to participate in its citizens’ celebration of a holiday that contains both a secular and a religious component, enforced recognition of only the secular aspect would signify the callous indifference toward religious faith that our cases and traditions do not require; for by commemorating the holiday only as it is celebrated by nonadherents, the government would be refusing to acknowledge the plain fact, and the historical reality, that many of its citizens celebrate its religious aspects as well. Judicial invalidation of government’s attempts to recognize the religious underpinnings of the holiday would signal not neutrality but a pervasive intent to insulate government from all things religious. The <span title="1727" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1727">p. 1727</span>Religion Clauses do not require government to acknowledge these holidays or their religious component; but our strong tradition of government accommodation and acknowledgment permits government to do so.</p>
<p id="fc66f59f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no suggestion here that the government’s power to coerce has been used to further the interests of Christianity or Judaism in any way. No one was compelled to observe or participate in any religious ceremony or activity. Neither the city nor the county contributed significant amounts of tax money to serve the cause of one religious faith. The creche and the menorah are purely passive symbols of religious holidays. Passersby who disagree with the message conveyed by these displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their backs, just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of government speech.</p>

<p id="fc66f5a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is firmly established that the government violates the Establishment Clause if it discriminates among religious groups. Such discrimination will be allowed only if strict scrutiny is met. If there is not discrimination, the case is discussed under the <i>Lemon</i> test described in the next subsection. In Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680 (1989), the Court explained, “[W]hen it is claimed that a denominational preference exists, the initial inquiry is whether the law facially differentiates among religions. If no such facial preference exists, we proceed to apply the customary three-pronged Establishment Clause inquiry derived from Lemon v. Kurtzman.”</p>
<p id="fc66f5a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982), applied this principle to declare unconstitutional a Minnesota law that imposed registration and reporting requirements on charitable organizations but exempted religious institutions that received more than half of their financial support from members’ contributions.</p>
<p id="fc66f5a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the “history and logic of the Establishment Clause [mean] that no State can ‘pass laws which aid one religion’ or that ‘prefer one religion over another.’” The Court concluded that the 50 percent requirement “clearly grants denominational preferences of the sort consistently and firmly deprecated in our precedents” and thus could not be allowed unless strict scrutiny was met. Religions that met the requirement, such as the Catholic Church, had the great benefit of being exempt from the burdens of the statute; religions that did not meet the requirement, such as the “Moonies,” would have to comply with the law. The Court found that there was no compelling interest to justify the discrimination and thus concluded that the “fifty percent rule sets up precisely the sort of official denominational preference that the Framers of the First Amendment forbade.”</p>
<p id="fc66f5a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also applied this neutrality principle in Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687 (1994), to declare unconstitutional a state law that created a separate school district for a small village that was inhabited by Hasidic Jews. The Village of Kiryas Joel was created by a sect known as Satmar Hasidim. They maintained two parochial schools, one for boys and one for girls. However, they did not have any services available for children with disabilities. Until the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1985, the government provided special education for such children within <span title="1728" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1728">p. 1728</span>the parochial schools.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ADC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10ADC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">37</a></span> In response to these Supreme Court decisions, the State of New York adopted a law that created a public school district with boundaries identical to those of the Village of Kiryas Joel. The school board for the village was like all other school boards, except that all of its elected members were part of the Satmar Hasidic sect.</p>
<p id="fc66f5a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Souter, writing for the Court, declared the New York law unconstitutional as impermissible preference for one religion over others. The government created a school district specifically to help one religion so that it could provide special education without its children having to attend school with those outside the faith. Justice Souter explained that “the fundamental source of constitutional concern here is that the legislature itself may fail to exercise governmental authority in a religiously neutral way.”</p>
<p id="fc671bb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a part of the opinion that was joined only by a plurality, Justice Souter also said that the law violated the Establishment Clause because the government was impermissibly delegating government authority to a religious entity. He said that creating a government entity contiguous with a religious community and thereby allowing the religion to control its political process was an impermissible “fusion of governmental and religious functions.”</p>
<p id="fc671bb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, cases such as <i>Larson</i> and <i>Kiryas Joel</i> establish that a government action violates the Establishment Clause if it prefers one religion or sect over others. In such instances, the Court invalidates the law without reaching the <i>Lemon</i> test, discussed below. Yet the neutrality approach taken in cases such as <i>Larson</i> and <i>Kiryas Joel</i> is remarkably similar to the analysis under the first two prongs of the <i>Lemon</i> test: If the government is favoring one religion, it is acting with the purpose, and there is the effect of fostering that religion.</p>

<p id="fc671bc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These two appeals raise questions as to Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes providing state aid to church-related elementary and secondary schools. Pennsylvania has adopted a statutory program that provides financial support to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools by way of reimbursement for the cost of teachers’ salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in specified secular subjects. Rhode Island has adopted a statute under which the State pays directly to teachers in nonpublic elementary schools a supplement of 15% of their annual salary. Under each statute state aid has been given to church-related educational institutions. We hold that both statutes are unconstitutional.</p>

Its authors did not simply prohibit the establishment of a state church or a state religion, an area history shows they regarded as very important and fraught with great dangers. Instead they commanded that there should be “no law respecting an establishment of religion.” A law may be one “respecting” the forbidden objective while falling short of its total realization. A law “respecting” the proscribed result, that is, the establishment of religion, is not always easily identifiable as one violative of the Clause. A given law might not establish a state religion but nevertheless be one “respecting” that end in the sense of being a step that could lead to such establishment and hence offend the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc671bc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of precisely stated constitutional prohibitions. we must draw lines with reference to the three main evils against which the Establishment Clause was intended to afford protection: “sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.”</p>
<p id="fc671bc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster “an excessive government entanglement with religion.”</p>
<p id="fc671bc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inquiry into the legislative purposes of the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes affords no basis for a conclusion that the legislative intent was to advance religion. On the contrary, the statutes themselves clearly state that they are intended to enhance the quality of the secular education in all schools covered by the compulsory attendance laws. There is no reason to believe the legislatures meant anything else. [However,] we conclude that the cumulative impact of the entire relationship arising under the statutes in each State involves excessive entanglement between government and religion. In order to determine whether the government entanglement with religion is excessive, we must examine the character and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, the nature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and the religious authority. Mr. Justice Harlan echoed the classic warning as to “programs whose very nature is apt to entangle the state in details of administration.” Here we find that both statutes foster an impermissible degree of entanglement.</p>

<p id="fc6742e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test is the requirement that there be a secular purpose for a law. For example, in Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that required the Ten Commandments to be posted on the walls of every public school classroom. The Court concluded that the law “has no secular legislative purpose” and therefore violated the Establishment Clause. Similarly, in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985), the Court invalidated a state law that authorized public school teachers to hold a one-minute period of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer. The Court found that the purpose behind the law was to reintroduce prayer into public schools and deemed the law unconstitutional because it “was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose—indeed, the statute had <i>no</i> secular purpose.”</p>
<p id="fc6742e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), the Court followed this reasoning and ruled unconstitutional a state law that required that public schools that teach evolution also teach “creation science.” Since “creation science” is a religious theory explaining the origin of human life, the Court concluded, “Because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to endorse a particular religious doctrine, the Act furthers religion in violation of the establishment clause.”</p>
<p id="fc6742e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state laws requiring businesses to be closed <span title="1731" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1731">p. 1731</span>on Sunday. The Court acknowledged “the strongly religious origin of these laws.” Nonetheless, the Court found the laws permissible because “[t]he present purpose and effect of most of them is to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens; the fact that this day is Sunday, a day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals.”</p>
<p id="fc6742e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several of the justices—especially Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia—have criticized the first prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test. Rehnquist has argued that the requirement for a secular purpose “is a constitutional theory [that] has no basis in the history of the amendment it seeks to interpret, is difficult to apply and yields unprincipled results.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BC7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BC7_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">42</a></span> Scalia contended, “[D]iscerning the subjective motivation of those enacting the statue is, to be honest, almost always an impossible task. The number of possible motivations . . . is not binary, or indeed even finite. . . . To look for <i>the sole purpose</i> of even a single legislator is probably to look for something that does not exist.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BD0_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BD0_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">43</a></span></p>
<p id="fc6742e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the Court considers legislative purpose, despite the difficulty in ascertaining it, in other areas of constitutional law, such as in the requirement for proof of a discriminatory purpose to prove a race or gender classification when there is a facially neutral law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BD9_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BD9_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">44</a></span> The rationale for the first prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test is that the very essence of the Establishment Clause is to keep the government from acting to advance religion.</p>

<p id="fc6742eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test requires that the principal or primary effect of a law must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. In recent years, this often has been expressed in terms of symbolic endorsement: The government’s action must not symbolically endorse religion or a particular religion.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BFC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BFC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">45</a></span></p>
<p id="fc6769fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 (1985), is an example where the Court used the second part of the <i>Lemon</i> test to invalidate a law. A Connecticut statute provided that no person may be required by an employer to work on his or her Sabbath. The Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional and emphasized that the law created an absolute and unqualified right for individuals to not work for religious reasons and thus favored religion over all other interests. The Court concluded that “the statute goes beyond having an incidental or remote effect of advancing religion. The statute has a primary effect that impermissibly advances a particular religious practice.”</p>
<p id="fc6769fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in other cases, the Court has upheld exemptions from laws for religion. In Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987), the Court found constitutional an exemption for religious organizations from Title VII’s prohibition against discrimination in employment based on religion. The Court concluded that <span title="1732" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1732">p. 1732</span>the exemption met the first prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test because it was a permissible purpose “to alleviate significant government interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions.”</p>
<p id="fc6769ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More significantly, the Court found that the exemption was not inconsistent with the second part of the <i>Lemon</i> test. Justice White, writing for the majority, said that “[a] law is not unconstitutional simply because it <i>allows</i> churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose. For a law to have forbidden ‘effects’ under <i>Lemon</i>, it must be fair to say that the <i>government itself</i> has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.”</p>
<p id="fc676a00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between <i>Thornton</i> and <i>Amos</i> is that the latter involved an exemption in a statute for religion, whereas the former concerned a law that provided a benefit solely for religion. The Court found that the latter was permissible, but that the former was the government advancing religion through its own activities and influence. Yet the distinction is difficult because both laws provided a preference for religion alone.</p>

<p id="fc676a03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test forbids government actions that cause excessive entanglement with religion. The Court has said that a law violates the Establishment Clause when it requires a “comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state survieillance.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C45_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C45_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">46</a></span> The Court also has said that “apart from any specific entanglement of the State in particular religious programs, assistance . . . [violates the Establishment Clause if it] carries the [grave] potential for entanglement in the broader sense of continuing political strife over aid to religion.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C4B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C4B_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">47</a></span></p>
<p id="fc676a06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot pay teacher salaries in parochial schools, even for teachers of secular subjects.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C54_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C54_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">48</a></span> If the government paid such salaries, it would need to monitor whether the teachers were teaching secular or religious material.

<p id="fc676a08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997), however, the Court held that it was permissible for public schoolteachers to provide remedial education in parochial schools. In doing so, the Court cast doubt as to whether the “entanglement prong” remains a separate prong of the analysis. The Court said, “Thus, it is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it as an aspect of the inquiry into a statute’s effect.” But the Court also reiterated that “excessive entanglement” violates the Establishment Clause: “Not all entanglements, of course, have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. Interaction between church and state is inevitable, and we have always tolerated some level of involvement between the two. Entanglement must be ‘excessive’ before it runs afoul of the Establishment Clause.” Subsequently, Justice O’Connor observed, “In Agostini v. Felton (1997), we folded the entanglement inquiry into the primary effect inquiry.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C63_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C63_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">49</a></span></p>

<p id="fc676a0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of cases concerning the Establishment Clause have involved free speech claims. Specifically, these cases concern situations where the government chooses to restrict private religious speech on government property or with government funds because of a desire to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court consistently has held that excluding such religious speech violates the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech because it is an impermissible content-based restriction of expression.</p>
<p id="fc676a0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases mark a significant development in Establishment Clause jurisprudence that changes the way many cases will be litigated and decided. If a government action can be characterized as a restriction of private religious speech, it can be challenged as violating the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech, and the challenger has a strong likelihood of prevailing; no longer will such cases be seen as exclusively or even predominantly involving the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p id="fc676a10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The initial Supreme Court cases in this area concerned efforts by the government to restrict religious groups from using school facilities so as to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state university’s policy of preventing student groups from using school facilities for religious worship or religious discussion. The University of Missouri at Kansas City allowed registered student groups to use its facilities, but forbade their use “for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching.”</p>
<p id="fc679121-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the university “discriminated against student groups and speakers based on their desire to use a generally open forum to engage in religious worship and discussion. These are forms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment.” The Court expressly rejected the dissent’s argument that religious worship is not speech protected by the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment. The Court said that the university had created a public forum by opening these places to speech and said that “[i]n order to justify discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based on the religious content of a group’s intended speech, the University must therefore satisfy the standard of review appropriate to content-based exclusions. It must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.”</p>
<p id="fc679122-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court then concluded that excluding religious speech was not necessary in order to be consistent with the Establishment Clause. The Court applied the <i>Lemon</i> test and said that opening school facilities to all groups served the secular purpose of providing a forum for student meetings. The Court said that any effect in advancing religion would be “incidental.” The Court concluded that allowing religious groups to use school facilities was not excessive entanglement with religion; no state monitoring would be necessary if the university allowed secular and religious groups to use the facilities.</p>
<p id="fc679123-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court followed similar reasoning in Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990). <i>Mergens</i> involved a <span title="1734" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1734">p. 1734</span>constitutional challenge to the federal Equal Access Act, which applies to any public school that receives federal financial assistance. The Equal Access Act says that any such school that opens its facilities to noncurricular student groups may not deny equal access to any students who wish to conduct meetings on similar terms because of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of their speech.</p>
<p id="fc679124-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor, writing for the plurality, said that “the logic of <i>Widmar</i> applies.” Justice O’Connor used the <i>Lemon</i> test and concluded that preventing discrimination against speech because of its religious, political, or philosophical content was a legitimate secular purpose. She said that the effect was not to advance religion because allowing religious groups to use school facilities was not likely to be perceived as a symbolic government endorsement of religion. Justice O’Connor wrote that “secondary school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis.” She said that “there is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.” Finally, Justice O’Conner concluded that there was not excessive entanglement with religion because faculty sponsors were not allowed to participate actively in religious groups’ meetings.</p>
<p id="fc679125-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Brennan and Marshall concurred in the judgment and emphasized that schools had the consitutional duty to make it clear that the government was not endorsing the views or activities of the religious groups. Justices Kennedy and Scalia also concurred in the judgment, though they used an accommodationist approach rather than the <i>Lemon</i> test. They said that the only relevant inquiries were whether the government aid was so extensive as to have a clear tendency to establish a state religion or whether the government was coercing student religious participation. They concluded that the Establishment Clause was not violated because there was neither the establishment of a state religion nor coercion of religious activities.</p>
<p id="fc679126-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District, 508 U.S. 384 (1993), the Court followed this reasoning and declared unconstitutional a school district’s policy of excluding religious groups from using school facilities during evenings and weekends. Pursuant to state law, a school district opened its facilities to community and civic groups during evenings and weekends, but said that “school premises shall not be used by any group for religious purposes.”</p>
<p id="fc679127-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court expressly followed the reasoning in <i>Widmar</i> and said that once the government chose to open its facilities to community groups it could not discriminate against those engaging in religious speech unless strict scrutiny was met. The Court again rejected the claim that avoiding violation of the Establishment Clause provided such a compelling interest. The Court said: “We have no more trouble than did the <i>Widmar</i> Court in disposing of the claimed defense on the ground that the posited fears of an Establishment Clause violation are unfounded. The showing of this film series would not have been during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members.” The Court concluded that “[a]s in <i>Widmar</i>, permitting District property to be used . . . would not have been an establishment of religion under the three-part test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman. The challenged governmental action has a secular purpose, does <span title="1735" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1735">p. 1735</span>not have the principal or primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, and does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.”</p>
<p id="fc679128-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98 (2001), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a school policy that allowed community groups to conduct after-school programs for students, but excluded a religious group that was essentially conducting workshop sessions, including Bible study. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Thomas, found that excluding the group was an impermissible content-based restriction on speech because it was denied access solely because of the religious content of its speech. The Court also found that allowing the group use of the facilities did not violate the Establishment Clause as long as religious and nonreligious groups were treated equally.</p>

<p id="fc67912b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court applied these cases in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), to declare unconstitutional a state university’s refusal to give student activity funds to a Christian group that published an expressly religious magazine.</p>
<p id="fc67912c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kennedy reasoned in two steps. First, he said that denying funds to the religious student group was impermissible content-based discrimination against religious speech. Kennedy expressly relied on <i>Widmar</i>, <i>Mergens</i>, and <i>Lamb’s Chapel</i> to conclude that the government unconstitutionally was discriminating against the Christian group because of the religious content of its speech. He said that although the government has wide discretion when it chooses to allocate scarce financial resources, “[i]t does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.” Kennedy said that “[v]ital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to examine publications to determine whether or not they are based on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them. The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling of individual thought and expression.”</p>
<p id="fc67912d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, Justice Kennedy concluded that providing funds to the religious group would not violate the Establishment Clause. He emphasized that “[t]he governmental program here is neutral toward religion.” The government was acting with the purpose and effect of helping student groups and fostering a wide array of activities and viewpoints on campus. Justice Kennedy cited to <i>Widmar</i>, <i>Mergens</i>, and <i>Lamb’s Chapel</i> and said that “[t]here is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its behalf.” Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion concluded: “There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University’s honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause.”</p>
<p id="fc67912e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Souter dissented and was joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer. He emphasized that this was the first time that the Court ever had allowed, let alone required, direct government financial subsidies to a religious group. Souter stated that “[u]sing public funds for the direct subsidization of <span title="1736" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1736">p. 1736</span>preaching the word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause, and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was meant to bar this use of public money.” He concluded that “[t]he principle against direct funding with public money is patently violated by the contested use of today’s student activity fee.”</p>

<p id="fc679131-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases under the Establishment Clause have involved issues of when, if at all, religion can become a part of government activities. For example, a large number of decisions have concerned the question of when religion impermissibly becomes a part of public school education. The Court has considered this topic in evaluating laws that allow children to be released from school for religious education, in considering prayers in public schools, and in evaluating curricular decisions made for religious reasons. In contrast to this area in which the Court has been very restrictive of religious presence in government activities, the Court has upheld the constitutionality of the government’s employment of a chaplain for the legislature. These cases are discussed in turn.</p>

<p id="fc679136-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first Supreme Court cases to consider religion as a part of public school activities concerned policies that allowed students to be released from classes to receive religious instruction. The Court said that this was impermissible if the religious teaching occurred on school premises, but allowed if the students were released to receive religious training elsewhere.</p>
<p id="fc679137-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203 (1948), the Court declared unconstitutional a school’s policy of allowing students to be released, with parental permission, to religious instruction classes conducted during regular school hours in the school building by outside teachers. The superintendent of schools approved the religious teachers, and attendance records were kept and reported to school authorities in the same way as for other classes. Students not attending the religion classes were left in a study hall; Justice Jackson referred to turning the school into a temporary jail for those who did not go to church.</p>
<p id="fc679138-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in an opinion by Justice Black, found the law unconstitutional as violating the “wall of separation between church and state.” Justice Black explained, “Here not only are the state’s tax-supported public school buildings used for the dissemination of religious doctrines. The State also affords sectarian groups an invaluable aid in that it helps to provide pupils for their religious classes through use of the State’s compulsory public school machinery. This is not separation of Church and State.”</p>
<p id="fc679139-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few years later, in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), the Supreme Court upheld a school board policy that allowed students to be released, during the school day, for religious instruction outside the school. Although Justice Douglas, writing for the Court, said that “[t]here cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflects the philosophy that Church and State should <span title="1737" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1737">p. 1737</span>be separated.” He also said, “We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.” The Court concluded that allowing students to receive religious instruction during school hours was simply accommodating religion and not a violation of the Establishment Clause since government funds and facilities were not used. Douglas wrote, “We would have to press the concept of separation of Church and State to these extremes to condemn the present law on constitutional grounds. . . . When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.”</p>
<p id="fc67913a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court distinguished <i>McCollum</i> because there “the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction.” In contrast, in <i>Zorach</i>, all of the religious education occurred off school premises.</p>

<p id="fc67b84d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Few Supreme Court decisions have been as controversial as those that declared unconstitutional prayers and Bible readings in public schools. The Supreme Court has invalidated prayer in public schools, including voluntary prayers led by instructors and a government-mandated moment of “silent prayer.” The Court also has followed this reasoning to invalidate clergy-delivered prayers at public school graduations. The Court, however, has not yet ruled as to whether a government-mandated moment of silent reflection would be allowed; nor has it decided the constitutionality of student-delivered prayers at public school graduations.</p>

<p id="fc67b855-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 9, New Hyde Park, New York, acting in its official capacity under state law, directed the School District’s principal to cause the following prayer to be said aloud by each class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day: “Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.”</p>
<p id="fc67b856-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This daily procedure was adopted on the recommendation of the State Board of Regents, a governmental agency created by the State Constitution to which the New York Legislature has granted broad supervisory, executive, and legislative powers over the State’s public school system. These state officials composed the prayer which they recommended and published as a part of their “Statement on Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools,” saying: “We believe that this Statement will be subscribed to by all men and women of good will, and we call upon all of them to aid in giving life to our program.”</p>
<p id="fc67b857-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1738" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1738">p. 1738</span>We think that by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the Regents’ prayer, the State of New York has adopted a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. There can, of course, be no doubt that New York’s program of daily classroom invocation of God’s blessings as prescribed in the Regents’ prayer is a religious activity. It is a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty. The nature of such a prayer has always been religious, none of the respondents has denied this and the trial court expressly so found.</p>
<p id="fc67b858-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioners contend among other things that the state laws requiring or permitting use of the Regents’ prayer must be struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs. For this reason, petitioners argue, the State’s use of the Regents’ prayer in its public school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church and State. We agree with that contention since we think that the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.</p>
<p id="fc67b859-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America. The Book of Common Prayer, which was created under governmental direction and which was approved by Acts of Parliament in 1548 and 1549, set out in minute detail the accepted form and content of prayer and other religious ceremonies to be used in the established, tax-supported Church of England. The controversies over the Book and what should be its content repeatedly threatened to disrupt the peace of that country as the accepted forms of prayer in the established church changed with the views of the particular ruler that happened to be in control at the time. Powerful groups representing some of the varying religious views of the people struggled among themselves to impress their particular views upon the Government and obtain amendments of the Book more suitable to their respective notions of how religious services should be conducted in order that the official religious establishment would advance their particular religious beliefs. Other groups, lacking the necessary political power to influence the Government on the matter, decided to leave England and its established church and seek freedom in America from England’s governmentally ordained and supported religion.</p>
<p id="fc67b85a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no doubt that New York’s state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs embodied in the Regents’ prayer. The respondents’ argument to the contrary, which is largely based upon the contention that the Regents’ prayer is “nondenominational” and the fact that the program, as modified and approved by state courts, does not require all pupils to recite the prayer but permits those who wish to do so to remain silent or be excused from the room, ignores the essential nature of the program’s constitutional defects. Neither the fact that the prayer may be denominationally neutral nor the fact that its observance on the part of the students is voluntary can serve to free it from the limitations of the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc67b85b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been argued that to apply the Constitution in such a way as to prohibit state laws respecting an establishment of religious services in public schools is to <span title="1739" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1739">p. 1739</span>indicate a hostility toward religion or toward prayer. Nothing, of course, could be more wrong. It is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for religious guidance.</p>
<p id="fc67b85c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc67b85d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A local school board in New York has provided that those pupils who wish to do so may join in a brief prayer at the beginning of each school day, acknowledging their dependence upon God and asking His blessing upon them and upon their parents, their teachers, and their country. The Court today decides that in permitting this brief non-denominational prayer the school board has violated the Constitution of the United States. I think this decision is wrong.</p>
<p id="fc67b85e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With all respect, I think the Court has misapplied a great constitutional principle. I cannot see how an “official religion” is established by letting those who want to say a prayer say it. On the contrary, I think that to deny the wish of these school children to join in reciting this prayer is to deny them the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our Nation.</p>
<p id="fc67b85f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the opening of each day’s Session of this Court we stand, while one of our officials invokes the protection of God. Since the days of John Marshall our Crier has said, “God save the United States and this Honorable Court.” Both the Senate and the House of Representatives open their daily Sessions with prayer. Each of our Presidents, from George Washington to John F. Kennedy, has upon assuming his Office asked the protection and help of God.</p>
<p id="fc67df70-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Countless similar examples could be listed, but there is no need to belabor the obvious. It was all summed up by this Court just ten years ago in a single sentence: “We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.” Zorach v. Clauson. I do not believe that this Court, or the Congress, or the President has by the actions and practices I have mentioned established an “official religion” in violation of the Constitution. And I do not believe the State of New York has done so in this case. What each has done has been to recognize and to follow the deeply entrenched and highly cherished spiritual traditions of our Nation—traditions which come down to us from those who almost two hundred years ago avowed their “firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence” when they proclaimed the freedom and independence of this brave new world.</p>

<p id="fc67df71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A year later, in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), the Court declared unconstitutional a state’s law and a city’s rule that required the reading, without comment, at the beginning of each school day of verses from the Bible and the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer by students in unison. Although <i>Schempp</i>, unlike <i>Engel</i>, did not involve a state-composed prayer, the laws requiring Bible reading and reciting of the Lord’s Prayer were deemed to violate the Establishment Clause. The Court emphasized that these religious exercises were prescribed as part of the curricular activities of students, conducted in school buildings, and supervised by teachers.</p>
<p id="fc67df72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court distinguished studying the Bible in a literature or comparative religion course, which would be permissible. The Court said that “the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required <span title="1740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1740">p. 1740</span>by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion.”</p>
<p id="fc67df73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985), the Court followed <i>Engel</i> and <i>Schempp</i> and declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that authorized a moment of silence in public schools for “meditation or voluntary prayer.” The legislative history of the law was clear that its purpose was to reintroduce prayer into the public schools. The Court said that the record was “unambiguous” that the law “was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose—indeed, the statute had <i>no</i> secular purpose.”</p>
<p id="fc67df74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court did not resolve the question of whether a moment of “silent reflection” would be permissible absent legislative history that indicated that its purpose was to reintroduce prayer into public schools. For some people, there seems little objectionable about teachers asking students to be silent for a moment at the beginning of the school day to collect their thoughts and mentally prepare for learning. But for others, government-mandated moments of silent reflection and prayer seem unnecessary; students surely have been saying silent prayers as long as teachers have been giving tests.</p>

She was about 14 years old. For many years it has been the policy of the Providence School Committee and the Superintendent of Schools to permit principals to invite members of the clergy to give invocations and benedictions at middle school and high school graduations. Many, but not all, of the principals elected to include prayers as part of the graduation ceremonies. Acting for himself and his daughter, Deborah’s father, Daniel Weisman, objected to any prayers at Deborah’s middle school graduation, but to no avail. The school principal, petitioner Robert E. Lee, invited a rabbi to deliver prayers at the graduation exercise for Deborah’s class. Rabbi Leslie Gutterman, of the Temple Beth El in Providence, accepted.</p>

<p id="fc6806a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These dominant facts mark and control the confines of our decision. State officials direct the performance of a formal religious exercise at promotional and graduation ceremonies for secondary schools. Even for those students who <span title="1742" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1742">p. 1742</span>object to the religious exercise, their attendance and participation in the state-sponsored religious activity are in a fair and real sense obligatory, though the school district does not require attendance as a condition for receipt of the diploma.</p>
<p id="fc6806a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he controlling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious exercise in primary and secondary public schools compel the holding here that the policy of the city of Providence is an unconstitutional one. We can decide the case without reconsidering the general constitutional framework by which public schools’ efforts to accommodate religion are measured. Thus we do not accept the invitation of petitioners and amicus the United States to reconsider our decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman.</p>
<p id="fc6806a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government involvement with religious activity in this case is pervasive, to the point of creating a state-sponsored and state-directed religious exercise in a public school. Conducting this formal religious observance conflicts with settled rules pertaining to prayer exercise for students, and that suffices to determine the question before us.</p>
<p id="fc6806a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which “establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.” The State’s involvement in the school prayers challenged today violates these central principles.</p>
<p id="fc6806a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That involvement is as troubling as it is undenied. A school official, the principal, decided that an invocation and a benediction should be given; this is a choice attributable to the State, and from a constitutional perspective it is as if a state statute decreed that the prayers must occur. The principal chose the religious participant, here a rabbi, and that choice is also attributable to the State.</p>
<p id="fc6806a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s role did not end with the decision to include a prayer and with the choice of a clergyman. Principal Lee provided Rabbi Gutterman with a copy of the “Guidelines for Civic Occasion,” and advised him that his prayers should be nonsectarian. Through these means the principal directed and controlled the content of the prayers. Even if the only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that the rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious representative who valued his or her continued reputation and effectiveness in the community would incur the State’s displeasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that “it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the Amercian people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government,” Engel v. Vitale (1962), and that is what the school officials attempted to do.</p>
<p id="fc6806a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment’s Religion Clauses mean that religious beliefs and religious expression are too precious to be either proscribed or prescribed by the State. The design of the Constitution is that preservation and transmission of religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the private sphere, which itself is promised freedom to pursue that mission.</p>
<p id="fc682db7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn our attention now to consider the position of the students, both those who desired the prayer and she who did not. As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools. What to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the <span title="1743" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1743">p. 1743</span>nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the State of enforce a religious orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="fc682db8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not look beyond the circumstances of this case to see the phenomenon at work. The undeniable fact is that the school district’s supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peer pressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. This pressure, though subtle and indirect, can be as real as any overt compulsion. Of course, in our culture standing or remaining silent can signify adherence to a view or simple respect for the views of others. And no doubt some persons who have no desire to join a prayer have little objection to standing as a sign of respect for those who do. But for the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonable perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will not allow, the injury is no less real. There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi’s prayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that for her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies mere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that, given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.</p>
<p id="fc682db9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The injury caused by the government’s action, and the reason why Daniel and Deborah Weisman object to it, is that the State, in a school setting, in effect required participation in a religious exercise. There was a stipulation in the District Court that attendance at graduation and promotional ceremonies is voluntary. Petitioners and the United States, as amicus, made this a center point of the case, arguing that the option of not attending the graduation excuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself. The argument lacks all persuasion. Law reaches past formalism. And to say a teenage student has a real choice not to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commencement without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allow the case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that in our society and in our culture high school graduation is one of life’s most significant occasions. A school rule which excuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may not be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term “voluntary,” for absence would require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which have motivated the student through youth and all her high school years. Graduation is a time for family and those closest to the student to celebrate success and express mutual wishes of gratitude and respect, all to the end of impressing upon the young person the role that it is his or her right and duty to assume in the community and all of its diverse parts.</p>
<p id="fc682dba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s argument gives insufficient recognition to the real conflict of conscience faced by the young student. The essence of the Government’s position is that with regard to a civic, social occasion of this importance it is the objector, not the majority, who must take unilateral and private action to avoid compromising religious scruples, hereby electing to miss the graduation exercise. This turns conventional First Amendment analysis on its head. It is a tenet of the First Amendment that the State cannot require one of its citizens <span title="1744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1744">p. 1744</span>to forfeit his or her rights and benefits as the price of resisting conformance to state-sponsored religious practice. To say that a student must remain apart from the ceremony at the opening invocation and closing benediction is to risk compelling conformity in an environment analogous to the classroom setting, where we have said the risk of compulsion is especially high.</p>
<p id="fc682dbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole question presented is whether a religious exercise may be conducted at a graduation ceremony in circumstances where, as we have found, young graduates who object are induced to conform. No holding by this Court suggests that a school can persuade or compel a student to participate in a religious exercise. That is being done here, and it is forbidden by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc682dbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span> join, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc682dbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nearly half a century of review and refinement of Establishment Clause jurisprudence has distilled one clear understanding: Government may neither promote not affiliate itself with any religious doctrine or organization, nor may it obtrude itself in the internal affairs of any religious institution. The application of these principles to the present case mandates the decision reached today by the Court.</p>
<p id="fc682dbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the Court’s opinion today because I find nothing in it inconsistent with the essential precepts of the Establishment Clause developed in our precedents. The Court holds that the graduation prayer is unconstitutional because the State “in effect required participation in a religious exercise.” Although our precedents make clear that proof of government coercion is not necessary to prove an Establishment Clause violation, it is sufficient. Government pressure to participate in a religious activity is an obvious indication that the government is endorsing or promoting religion.</p>
<p id="fc682dbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But it is not enough that the government restrain from compelling religious practices: It must not engage in them either. The Court repeatedly has recognized that a violation of the Establishment Clause is not predicated on coercion. The Establishment Clause proscribes public schools from “conveying or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred,” even if the schools do not actually “impos[e] pressure upon a student to participate in a religious activity.”</p>
<p id="fc682dc0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have believed that religious freedom cannot exist in the absence of a free democratic government, and that such a government cannot endure when there is fusion between religion and the political regime. We have believed that religious freedom cannot thrive in the absence of a vibrant religious community and that such a community cannot prosper when it is bound to the secular. And we have believed that these were the animating principles behind the adoption of the Establishment Clause. To that end, our cases have prohibited government endorsement of religion, its sponsorship, and active involvement in religion, whether or not citizens were coerced to conform.</p>
<p id="fc682dc1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Justice Souter also concurred, saying that coercion is sufficient, though not necessary, for a violation of the Establishment Clause.]</p>
<p id="fc682dc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc682dc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three Terms ago, I joined an opinion recognizing that the Establishment Clause must be construed in light of the “[g]overnment policies of <span title="1745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1745">p. 1745</span>accommodation, acknowledgement, and support for religion [that] are an accepted part of our political and cultural heritage.” That opinion affirmed that “the meaning of the Clause is to be determined by reference to historical practices and understandings.” County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>
<p id="fc682dc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These views of course prevent me from joining today’s opinion, which is conspicuously bereft of any reference to history. In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and benedictions at public-school graduation ceremonies, the Court—with nary a mention that it is doing so—lays waste a tradition that is as old as public-school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineering, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable, test of psychological coercion.</p>
<p id="fc682dc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Holmes’ aphorism that “a page of history is worth a volume of logic,” applies with particular force to our Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The history and tradition of our Nation are replete with public ceremonies featuring prayers of thanksgiving and petition. From our Nation’s origin, prayer has been a prominent part of governmental ceremonies and proclamations. The Declaration of Independence, the document marking our birth as a separate people, “appeal[ed] to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions” and avowed “a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence.” In his first inaugural address, after swearing his oath of office on a Bible, George Washington deliberately made a prayer a part of his first official act as President.</p>
<p id="fc682dc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court presumably would separate graduation invocations and benedictions from other instances of public “preservation and transmission of religious beliefs” on the ground that they involve “psychological coercion.” I find it a sufficient embarrassment that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence regarding holiday displays, see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter (1989), has come to “requir[e] scrutiny more commonly associated with interior decorators than with the judiciary.” But interior decorating is a rock-hard science compared to psychology practiced by amateurs. A few citations of “[r]esearch in psychology” that have no particular bearing upon the precise issue here, cannot disguise that fact that the Court has gone beyond the realm where judges know what they are doing. The Court’s argument that state officials have “coerced” students to take part in the invocation and benediction at graduation ceremonies is, not to put too fine a point on it, incoherent.</p>
<p id="fc682dc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court declares that students’ “attendance and participation in the [invocation and benediction] are in a fair and real sense obligatory.” But what exactly is this “fair and real sense”? According to the Court, students at graduation who want “to avoid the fact or appearance of participation,” in the invocation and benediction are psychologically obligated by “public pressure, as well as peer pressure, . . . to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence” during those prayers. This assertion—the very linchpin of the Court’s opinion—is almost as intriguing for what it does not say as for what it says. It does not say, for example, that students are psychologically coerced to bow their heads, place their hands in a Durer-like prayer position, pay attention to the prayers, utter “Amen,” or in fact pray. (Perhaps further intensive psychological research <span title="1746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1746">p. 1746</span>remains to be done on these matters.) It claims only that students are psychologically coerced “to stand . . . or, at least, maintain respectful silence.”</p>
<p id="fc682dc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin with the latter: The Court’s notion that a student who simply sits in “respectful silence” during the invocations and benediction (when all others are standing) has somehow joined—or would somehow be perceived as having joined—in the prayers is nothing short of ludicrous. We indeed live in a vulgar age. But surely “our social conventions,” have not coarsened to the point that anyone who does not stand on his chair and shout obscenities can reasonably be deemed to have assented to everything said in his presence. Since the Court does not dispute that students exposed to prayer at graduation ceremonies retain (despite “subtle coercive pressures”) the free will to sit, there is absolutely no basis for the Court’s decision. It is fanciful enough to say that “a reasonable dissenter,” standing head erect in a class of bowed heads, “could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.” It is beyond the absurd to say that she could entertain such a belief while pointedly declining to rise.</p>
<p id="fc682dc9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But let us assume the very worst, that the nonparticipating graduate is “subtly coerced” . . . to stand! Even that half of the disjunctive does not remotely establish a “participation” (or an “appearance of participation”) in a religious exercise. I may add, moreover, that maintaining respect for the religious observances of others is a fundamental civic virtue that government (including the public schools) can and should cultivate—so that even if it were the case that the displaying of such respect might be mistaken for taking part in the prayer, I would deny that the dissenter’s interest in avoiding even the false appearance of participation constitutionally trumps the government’s interest in fostering respect for religion generally.</p>
<p id="fc682dca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion manifests that the Court itself has not given careful consideration to its test of psychological coercion. For if it had, how could it observe, with no hint of concern or disapproval, that students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance, which immediately preceded Rabbi Gutterman’s invocation? The government can, of course, no more coerce political orthodoxy than religious orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="fc682dcb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I also find it odd that the Court concludes that high school graduates may not be subject to this supposed psychological coercion, yet refrains from addressing whether “mature adults” may. I had though that the reason graduation from high school is regarded as so significant an event is that it is generally associated with transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Many graduating seniors, of course, are old enough to vote. Why then, does the Court treat them as though they were first-graders? Will we soon have a jurisprudence that distinguishes between mature and immature adults?</p>
<p id="fc682dcc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deeper flaw in the Court’s opinion does not lie in its wrong answer to the question whether there was state-induced “peer-pressure” coercion; it lies, rather, in the Court’s making violation of the Establishment Clause hinge on such a precious question. The coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty. The Establishment Clause was adopted to prohibit such an establishment of religion at the federal level (and to protect state establishments of religion from federal interference).</p>
<p id="fc6854dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, while I have no quarrel with the Court’s general proposition that the Establishment Clause “guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to <span title="1747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1747">p. 1747</span>support or participate in religion or its exercise,” I see no warrant for expanding the concept of coercion beyond acts backed by threat of penalty—a brand of coercion that, happily, is readily discernible to those of us who have made a career of reading the disciples of Blackstone rather than of Freud. The framers were indeed opposed to coercion of religious worship by the National Government; but, as their own sponsorship of nonsectarian prayer in public events demonstrates, they understood that “[s]peech is not coercive; the listener may do as he likes.”</p>
<p id="fc6854de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reader has been told much in this case about the personal interest of Mr. Weisman and his daughter, and very little about the personal interests on the other side. They are not inconsequential. Church and state would not be such a difficult subject if religion were, as the Court apparently thinks it to be, some purely personal avocation that can be indulged entirely in secret, like pornography, in the privacy of one’s room. For most believers it is not that, and has never been. Religious men and women of almost all denominations have felt it necessary to acknowledge and beseech the blessing of God as a people, and not just as individuals, because they believe in the “protection of divine Providence,” as the Declaration of Independence put it, not just for individuals but for societies; because they believe God to be, as Washington’s first Thanksgiving Proclamation put it, the “Great Lord and Ruler of Nations.” One can believe in the effectiveness of such public worship, or one can deprecate and deride it. But the longstanding Amercian tradition of prayer at official ceremonies displays with unmistakable clarity that the Establishment Clause does not forbid the government to accommodate it.</p>
<p id="fc6854df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I must add one final observation: The Founders of our Republic knew the fearsome potential of sectarian religious belief to generate civil dissension and civil strife. And they also knew that nothing, absolutely nothing, is so inclined to foster among religious believers of various faith a toleration—no, an affection—for one another than voluntarily joining in prayer together, to the God whom they all worship and seek. Needless to say, no one should be compelled to do that, but it is a shame to deprive our public culture of the opportunity, and indeed the encouragement, for people to do it voluntarily. The Baptist or Catholic who heard and joined in the simple and inspiring prayers of Rabbi Gutterman on this official and patriotic occasion was inoculated from religious bigotry and prejudice in a manner that cannot be replicated. To deprive our society of that important unifying mechanism, in order to spare the nonbeliever what seems to me the minimal inconvenience of standing or even sitting in respectful nonparticipation, is as senseless in policy as it in unsupported in law.</p>

<p id="fc687bfb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final policy (October policy) is essentially the same as the August policy, though it omits the word “prayer” from its title, and refers to “messages” and “statements” as well as “invocations.” It is the validity of that policy that is before us.</p>
<p id="fc687bfc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted the District’s petition for certiorari, limited to the following question: “Whether petitioner’s policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violates the Establishment Clause.” We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that it does.</p>

<p id="fc687bfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lee v. Weisman (1992), we held that a prayer delivered by a rabbi at a middle school graduation ceremony violated that Clause. Although this case involves student prayer at a different type of school function, our analysis is properly guided by the principles that we endorsed in <i>Lee</i>.</p>
<p id="fc687bff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1749" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1749">p. 1749</span>In this case the District first argues that this principle is inapplicable to its October policy because the messages are private student speech, not public speech. It reminds us that there is a crucial difference between <i>government</i> speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and <i>private</i> speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.</p>
<p id="fc687c00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We certainly agree with that distinction, but we are not persuaded that the pregame invocations should be regarded as “private speech.” These invocations are authorized by a government policy and take place on government property at government-sponsored school-related events. Of course, not every message delivered under such circumstances is the government’s own. We have held, for example, that an individual’s contribution to a government-created forum was not government speech. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). Although the District relies heavily on <i>Rosenberger</i> and similar cases involving such forums, it is clear that the pregame ceremony is not the type of forum discussed in those cases. The Santa Fe school officials simply do not “evince either ‘by policy or by practice,’ any intent to open the [pregame ceremony] to ‘indiscriminate use,’ . . . by the student body generally.” Rather, the school allows only one student, the same student for the entire season, to give the invocation. The statement or invocation, moreover, is subject to particular regulations that confine the content and topic of the student’s message.</p>
<p id="fc687c01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Granting only one student access to the stage at a time does not, of course, necessarily preclude a finding that a school has created a limited public forum. Here, however, Santa Fe’s student election system ensures that only those messages deemed “appropriate” under the District’s policy may be delivered. That is, the majoritarian process implemented by the District guarantees, by definition, that minority candidates will never prevail and that their views will be effectively silenced.</p>
<p id="fc687c02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Lee</i>, the school district made the related argument that its policy of endorsing only “civic or nonsectarian” prayer was acceptable because it minimized the intrusion on the audience as a whole. We rejected that claim by explaining that such a majoritarian policy “does not lessen the offense or isolation to the objectors. At best it narrows their number, at worst increases their sense of isolation and affront.” Similarly, while Santa Fe’s majoritarian election might ensure that most of the students are represented, it does nothing to protect the minority; indeed, it likely serves to intensify their offense.</p>
<p id="fc687c03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the District has failed to divorce itself from the religious content in the invocations. It has not succeeded in doing so, either by claiming that its policy is “‘one of neutrality rather than endorsement’” or by characterizing the individual student as the “circuit-breaker” in the process. Contrary to the District’s repeated assertions that it has adopted a “hands-off” approach to the pregame invocation, the realities of the situation plainly reveal that its policy involves both perceived and actual endorsement of religion. In this case, as we found in <i>Lee</i>, the “degree of school involvement” makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear “the imprint of the State and thus put school-age children who objected in an untenable position.”</p>
<p id="fc687c04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to involving the school in the selection of the speaker, the policy, by its terms, invites and encourages religious messages. The policy itself states that the purpose of the message is “to solemnize the event.” A religious message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Moreover, the requirements <span title="1750" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1750">p. 1750</span>that the message “promote good citizenship” and “establish the appropriate environment for competition” further narrow the types of message deemed appropriate, suggesting that a solemn, yet nonreligious, message, such as commentary on United States foreign policy, would be prohibited. Indeed, the only type of message that is expressly endorsed in the text is an “invocation”—a term that primarily described an appeal for divine assistance. In fact, as used in the past at Santa Fe High School, an “invocation” has always entailed a focused religious message. Thus, the expressed purposes of the policy encourage the selection of a religious message, and that is precisely how the students understand the policy. The results of the elections described in the parties’ stipulation make it clear that the students understood that the central question before them was whether prayer should be a part of the pregame ceremony. We recognize the important role that public worship plays in many communities, as well as the sincere desire to include public prayer as a part of various occasions so as to mark those occasions’ significance. But such religious activity in public schools, as elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc687c05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The actual or perceived endorsement of the message, moreover, is established by factors beyond just the text of the policy. Once the student speaker is selected and the message composed, the invocation is then delivered to a large audience assembled as part of a regularly scheduled, school-sponsored function conducted on school property. The message is broadcast over the school’s public address system, which remains subject to the control of school officials. It is fair to assume that the pregame ceremony is clothed in the traditional indicia of school sporting events, which generally include not just the team, but also cheerleaders and band members dressed in uniforms sporting the school name and mascot. The school’s name is likely written in large print across the field and on banners and flags. The crowd will certainly include many who display the school colors and insignia on their school T-shirts, jackets, or hats and who may also be waving signs displaying the school name. It is in a setting such as this that “[t]he board has chosen to permit” the elected student to rise and give the “statement or invocation.”</p>
<p id="fc687c06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this context the members of the listening audience must perceive the pregame message as a public expression of the views of the majority of the student body delivered with the approval of the school administration. In cases involving state participation in a religious activity, one of the relevant questions is “whether an objective observer, acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute, would perceive it as a state endorsement of prayer in public schools.” Regardless of the listener’s support for, or objection to, the message, an objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school’s seal of approval.</p>
<p id="fc687c07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">School sponsorship of religious message is impermissible because it sends the ancillary message to members of the audience who are nonadherents “that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.” The delivery of such a message—over the school’s public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer—is not properly characterized as “private” speech.</p>
<p id="fc687c08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District next argues that its football policy is distinguishable from the graduation prayer in <i>Lee</i> because it does not coerce students to participate <span title="1751" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1751">p. 1751</span>in religious observances. Attendance at a high school football game, unlike showing up for class, is certainly not required in order to receive a diploma. Moreover, we may assume that the District is correct in arguing that the informal pressure to attend an athletic event is not as strong as a senior’s desire to attend her own graduation ceremony. There are some students, however, such as cheerleaders, members of the band, and, of course, the team members themselves, for whom seasonal commitments mandate their attendance, sometimes for class credit. The District also minimizes the importance to many students of attending and participating in extracurricular activities as part of a complete educational experience.</p>
<p id="fc687c09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">High school home football games are traditional gatherings of a school community; they bring together students and faculty as well as friends and family from years present and past to root for a common cause. Undoubtedly, the games are not important to some students, and they voluntarily choose not to attend. For many others, however, the choice between whether to attend these games or to risk facing a personally offensive religious ritual is in no practical sense an easy one. The Constitution, moreover, demands that the school may not force this difficult choice upon these students for “[i]t is a tenet of the First Amendment that the State cannot require one of its citizens to forfeit his or her rights and benefits as the price of resisting conformance to state-sponsored religious practice.”</p>
<p id="fc687c0a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we regard every high school student’s decision to attend a home football game as purely voluntary, we are nevertheless persuaded that the delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship. For “the government may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means.”</p>
<p id="fc68a31b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc68a31c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court distorts existing precedent to conclude that the school district’s student-message program is invalid on its face under the Establishment Clause. But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the Court’s opinion; it bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life. Neither the holding nor the tone of the opinion is faithful to the meaning of the Establishment Clause, when it is recalled that George Washington himself, at the request of the very Congress which passed the Bill of Rights, proclaimed a day of “public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God.”</p>
<p id="fc68a31d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, venturing into the realm of prophesy, decides that it “need not wait for the inevitable” and invalidates the district’s policy on its face. To do so, it applies the most rigid version of the oft-criticized test of Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). Even if it were appropriate to apply the <i>Lemon</i> test here, the district’s student-message policy should not be invalidated on its face.</p>
<p id="fc68a31e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]ith respect to the policy’s purpose, the Court holds that “the simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school endorsement of student prayer, was a constitutional violation.” But the policy itself has plausible secular purposes: “[T]o solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate environment for the competition.” Where a governmental body “expresses a plausible secular purpose” for an enactment, “courts should generally defer to that stated intent.” Under the <span title="1752" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1752">p. 1752</span>Court’s logic, a public school that sponsors the singing of the national anthem before football games violates the Establishment Clause. Although the Court apparently believes that solemnizing football games is an illegitimate purpose, the voters in the school district seem to disagree. Nothing in the Establishment Clause prevents them from making this choice.</p>

<p id="fc68a321-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional government decisions concerning the curriculum that were motivated by religious purpose. These cases primarily have concerned state law prohibiting the teaching of evolution or requiring the teaching of “creationism” when evolution is taught.</p>
<p id="fc68a322-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), the Court declared unconstitutional an Arkansas law that made it unlawful for a teacher in a state-supported school or university “to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals” or “to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches” this theory. The Court held that the law prohibiting teaching of evolution was motivated by a religious purpose and thus violated the Establishment Clause. The Court explained, “The overriding fact is that Arkansas’ law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group.” The Court observed that “[t]here is and can be no doubt that the First Amendment does not permit the State to require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.” The Arkansas law did exactly that: preclude teaching of evolution because it was a theory opposed by some religions.</p>
<p id="fc68a323-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), the Court followed this same reasoning and declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law that prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools unless accompanied by instruction in “creation science.” The Court noted that, as in <i>Epperson</i>, the “same historic and contemporaneous antagonisms between the teachings of certain religious denominations and the teaching of evolution are present in this case.” The Court said that the law’s “primary purpose was to change the science curriculum of public schools in order to provide persuasive advantage to a particular religious doctrine that rejects the factual basis of evolution in its entirety.” The Court thus concluded, “Because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to advance a particular religious belief, the Act endorses religion in violation of the First Amendment.”</p>

<p id="fc68a327-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Marsh v.

From colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since, the practice of legislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom. This unique history leads us to accept the interpretation of the First Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause arising from a practice of prayer similar to that now challenged.</p>
<p id="fc68a329-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the unambiguous and unbroken history of more than 200 years, there can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has become part of the fabric of our society.

<p id="fc68ca42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Greece, a town with a population of 94,000, is in upstate New York. For some years, it began its monthly town board meetings with a moment of silence. In 1999, the newly elected town supervisor, John Auberger, decided to replicate the prayer practice he had found meaningful while serving in the county legislature. Following the roll call and recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, Auberger would invite a local clergyman to the front of the room to deliver an invocation. After the prayer, Auberger would thank the minister for serving as the board’s “chaplain for the month” and present him with a commemorative plaque. The prayer was intended to place town board members in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind, invoke divine guidance in town affairs, and follow a tradition practiced by Congress and dozens of state legislatures.</p>
<p id="fc68ca43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The town followed an informal method for selecting prayer givers, all of whom were unpaid volunteers. A town employee would call the congregations listed in a local directory until she found a minister available for that month’s meeting. The town eventually compiled a list of willing “board chaplains” who had accepted invitations and agreed to return in the future. The town at no point excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer giver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or layperson of any persuasion, including an atheist, could give the invocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town were Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of the participating ministers were too.</p>
<p id="fc68ca44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1754">p. 1754</span>Greece neither reviewed the prayers in advance of the meetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or content, in the belief that exercising any degree of control over the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and speech rights of the ministers. The town instead left the guest clergy free to compose their own devotions. The resulting prayers often sounded both civic and religious themes. Typical were invocations that asked the divinity to abide at the meeting and bestow blessings on the community. Some of the ministers spoke in a distinctly Christian idiom; and a minority invoked religious holidays, scripture, or doctrine.</p>
<p id="fc68ca45-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens attended town board meetings to speak about issues of local concern, and they objected that the prayers violated their religious or philosophical views. At one meeting, Galloway admonished board members that she found the prayers “offensive,” “intolerable,” and an affront to a “diverse community.” After respondents complained that Christian themes pervaded the prayers, to the exclusion of citizens who did not share those beliefs, the town invited a Jewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i temple to deliver prayers. A Wiccan priestess who had read press reports about the prayer controversy requested, and was granted, an opportunity to give the invocation.</p>
<p id="fc68ca46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Galloway and Stephens brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.

<p id="fc68ca48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Marsh v. Chambers, the Court found no First Amendment violation in the Nebraska Legislature’s practice of opening its sessions with a prayer delivered by a chaplain paid from state funds. The decision concluded that legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the framing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends gravity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful society. The Court has considered this symbolic expression to be a “tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held,” rather than a first, treacherous step towards establishment of a state church.</p>
<p id="fc68ca49-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Marsh</i> is sometimes described as “carving out an exception” to the Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence, because it sustained legislative prayer without subjecting the practice to “any of the formal ‘tests’ that have traditionally structured” this inquiry. The Court in <i>Marsh</i> found those tests unnecessary because history supported the conclusion that legislative invocations are compatible with the Establishment Clause. The First Congress made it an early item of business to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both the House and Senate have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time.</p>
<p id="fc68ca4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Marsh</i> must not be understood as permitting a practice that would amount to a constitutional violation if not for its historical foundation. The case teaches instead that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted “by reference to historical practices and understandings.” That the First Congress provided for the appointment of chaplains only days after approving language for the First <span title="1755" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1755">p. 1755</span>Amendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s role in society. In the 1850’s, the judiciary committees in both the House and Senate reevaluated the practice of official chaplaincies after receiving petitions to abolish the office. The committees concluded that the office posed no threat of an establishment because lawmakers were not compelled to attend the daily prayer, no faith was excluded by law, nor any favored, and the cost of the chaplain’s salary imposed a vanishingly small burden on taxpayers. <i>Marsh</i> stands for the proposition that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary of the Establishment Clause where history shows that the specific practice is permitted. Any test the Court adopts must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. A test that would sweep away what has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very divisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.</p>
<p id="fc68f15b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.</p>

<p id="fc68f15d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents maintain that prayer must be nonsectarian, or not identifiable with any one religion; and they fault the town for permitting guest chaplains to deliver prayers that “use overtly Christian terms” or “invoke specifics of Christian theology.” A prayer is fitting for the public sphere, in their view, only if it contains “the most general, nonsectarian reference to God,” and eschews mention of doctrines associated with any one faith.</p>
<p id="fc68f15e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single, fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in the Court’s cases. The Court found the prayers in <i>Marsh</i> consistent with the First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic theism but because our history and tradition have shown that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom.” The Congress that drafted the First Amendment would have been accustomed to invocations containing explicitly religious themes of the sort respondents find objectionable. One of the Senate’s first chaplains, the Rev. William White, gave prayers in a series that included the Lord’s Prayer, the Collect for Ash Wednesday, prayers for peace and grace, a general thanksgiving, St. Chrysostom’s Prayer, and a prayer seeking “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.”</p>
<p id="fc68f15f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, a rule that would involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact. Our Government is prohibited from prescribing prayers to be recited in our public institutions in order to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior. It would be but a few steps removed from that prohibition for legislatures to require chaplains to redact the religious content from their message in order to make it acceptable for the public sphere. Government may not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the most generic reference to the sacred any more than it may prescribe a religious orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="fc68f160-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1756" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1756">p. 1756</span>Respondents argue, in effect, that legislative prayer may be addressed only to a generic God. The law and the Court could not draw this line for each specific prayer or seek to require ministers to set aside their nuanced and deeply personal beliefs for vague and artificial ones. There is doubt, in any event, that consensus might be reached as to what qualifies as generic or nonsectarian. Honorifics like “Lord of Lords” or “King of Kings” might strike a Christian audience as ecumenical, yet these titles may have no place in the vocabulary of other faith traditions.</p>
<p id="fc68f161-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content. The relevant constraint derives from its place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. Prayer that is solemn and respectful in tone, that invites lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing, serves that legitimate function. If the course and practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion, many present may consider the prayer to fall short of the desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion and to unite lawmakers in their common effort. That circumstance would present a different case than the one presently before the Court.</p>
<p id="fc68f162-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prayers delivered in the town of Greece do not fall outside the tradition this Court has recognized. A number of the prayers did invoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly Father, or the Holy Spirit, but they also invoked universal themes, as by celebrating the changing of the seasons or calling for a “spirit of cooperation” among town leaders.</p>
<p id="fc68f163-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation. <i>Marsh</i>, indeed, requires an inquiry into the prayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the contents of a single prayer.</p>
<p id="fc68f164-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the Court of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened the Establishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Christian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located within its borders and represented that it would welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one. That nearly all of the congregations in town turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths. So long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing. The quest to promote “a ‘diversity’ of religious views” would require the town “to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions [it] should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor each,” a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more troublesome than the current approach.</p>

<p id="fc68f166-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents further seek to distinguish the town’s prayer practice from the tradition upheld in <i>Marsh</i> on the ground that it coerces participation by nonadherents. They and some <i>amici</i> contend that prayer conducted in the intimate setting of a town board meeting differs in fundamental ways from the invocations <span title="1757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1757">p. 1757</span>delivered in Congress and state legislatures, where the public remains segregated from legislative activity and may not address the body except by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town meetings, on the other hand, to accept awards; speak on matters of local importance; and petition the board for action that may affect their economic interests, such as the granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning variances. Respondents argue that the public may feel subtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their beliefs in order to please the board members from whom they are about to seek a favorable ruling. In their view the fact that board members in small towns know many of their constituents by name only increases the pressure to conform.</p>
<p id="fc68f167-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is an elemental First Amendment principle that government may not coerce its citizens “to support or participate in any religion or its exercise.” On the record in this case the Court is not persuaded that the town of Greece, through the act of offering a brief, solemn, and respectful prayer to open its monthly meetings, compelled its citizens to engage in a religious observance. The inquiry remains a fact-sensitive one that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.</p>
<p id="fc68f168-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prayer opportunity in this case must be evaluated against the backdrop of historical practice. As a practice that has long endured, legislative prayer has become part of our heritage and tradition, part of our expressive idiom, similar to the Pledge of Allegiance, inaugural prayer, or the recitation of “God save the United States and this honorable Court” at the opening of this Court’s sessions. It is presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and understands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many private citizens, not to afford government an opportunity to proselytize or force truant constituents into the pews.</p>
<p id="fc68f169-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal audience for these invocations is not, indeed, the public but lawmakers themselves, who may find that a moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the mind to a higher purpose and thereby eases the task of governing. For members of town boards and commissions, who often serve part-time and as volunteers, ceremonial prayer may also reflect the values they hold as private citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to show who and what they are without denying the right to dissent by those who disagree.</p>
<p id="fc68f16a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The analysis would be different if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers, singled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their decisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity. No such thing occurred in the town of Greece.</p>
<p id="fc68f16b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In their declarations in the trial court, respondents stated that the prayers gave them offense and made them feel excluded and disrespected. Offense, however, does not equate to coercion. Adults often encounter speech they find disagreeable; and an Establishment Clause violation is not made out any time a person experiences a sense of affront from the expression of contrary religious views in a legislative forum, especially where, as here, any member of the public is welcome in turn to offer an invocation reflecting his or her own convictions.</p>
<p id="fc69187c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this Nation was founded and until the present day, many Americans deem that their own existence must be understood by precepts far beyond the authority of government to alter or define and that willing participation in civic affairs can be consistent with a brief acknowledgment of their belief in a higher power, always with due respect for <span title="1758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1758">p. 1758</span>those who adhere to other beliefs. The prayer in this case has a permissible ceremonial purpose. It is not an unconstitutional establishment of religion.</p>
<p id="fc69187d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition and does not coerce participation by nonadherents.</p>

<p id="fc691881-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As I have explained before, the text and history of the [Establishment] Clause “resis[t] incorporation” against the States. If the Establishment Clause is not incorporated, then it has no application here, where only municipal action is at issue.</p>
<p id="fc691882-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an initial matter, the Clause probably prohibits Congress from establishing a national religion. The text of the Clause also suggests that Congress “could not interfere with state establishments, notwithstanding any argument that could be made based on Congress’ power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.” That choice of language—“Congress shall make no law”—effectively denied Congress any power to regulate state establishments.</p>

<p id="fc691884-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Establishment Clause were properly incorporated against the States, the municipal prayers at issue in this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding. “The coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support <i>by force of law and threat of penalty</i>.”</p>
<p id="fc691885-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, to the extent coercion is relevant to the Establishment Clause analysis, it is actual legal coercion that counts—not the “subtle coercive pressures” allegedly felt by respondents in this case. The majority properly concludes that “[o]ffense . . . does not equate to coercion,” since “[a]dults often encounter speech they find disagreeable[,] and an Establishment Clause violation is not made out any time a person experiences a sense of affront from the expression of contrary religious views in a legislative forum.” I would simply add, in light of the foregoing history of the Establishment Clause, that “[p]eer pressure, unpleasant as it may be, is not coercion” either.</p>

<p id="fc691887-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For centuries now, people have come to this country from every corner of the world to share in the blessing of religious freedom. Our Constitution promises that they may worship in their own way, without fear of penalty or danger, and that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our Constitution makes a commitment still more remarkable—that however those individuals worship, they <span title="1759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1759">p. 1759</span>will count as full and equal American citizens. A Christian, a Jew, a Muslim (and so forth)—each stands in the same relationship with her country, with her state and local communities, and with every level and body of government. So that when each person performs the duties or seeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an adherent to one or another religion, but simply as an American.</p>
<p id="fc691888-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I respectfully dissent from the Court’s opinion because I think the Town of Greece’s prayer practices violate that norm of religious equality—the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian. I do not contend that principle translates here into a bright separationist line. To the contrary, I agree with the Court’s decision in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), upholding the Nebraska Legislature’s tradition of beginning each session with a chaplain’s prayer. And I believe that pluralism and inclusion in a town hall can satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality; such a forum need not become a religion-free zone. But still, the Town of Greece should lose this case. The practice at issue here differs from the one sustained in <i>Marsh</i> because Greece’s town meetings involve participation by ordinary citizens, and the invocations given—directly to those citizens—were predominantly sectarian in content. Still more, Greece’s Board did nothing to recognize religious diversity: In arranging for clergy members to open each meeting, the Town never sought (except briefly when this suit was filed) to involve, accommodate, or in any way reach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So month in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits. In my view, that practice does not square with the First Amendment’s promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government.</p>

<p id="fc69188a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of Greece, consider several hypothetical scenarios in which sectarian prayer—taken straight from this case’s record—infuses governmental activities. None involves, as this case does, a proceeding that could be characterized as a legislative session, but they are useful to elaborate some general principles. In each instance, assume (as was true in Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to government policy and is representative of the prayers generally offered in the designated setting:</p>
<p id="fc69188b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are a party in a case going to trial; let’s say you have filed suit against the government for violating one of your legal rights. The judge bangs his gavel to call the court to order, asks a minister to come to the front of the room, and instructs the 10 or so individuals present to rise for an opening prayer. The clergyman faces those in attendance and says: “Lord, God of all creation. . . . We acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. We draw strength . . . from his resurrection at Easter. Jesus Christ, who took away the sins of the world, destroyed our death, through his dying and in his rising, he has restored our life. Blessed are you, who has raised up the Lord Jesus, you who will raise us, in our turn, and put us by His side. . . . Amen.” The judge then asks your lawyer to begin the trial.</p>
<p id="fc693e9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1760" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1760">p. 1760</span>It’s election day, and you head over to your local polling place to vote. As you and others wait to give your names and receive your ballots, an election official asks everyone there to join him in prayer. He says: “We pray this [day] for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as [we vote]. . . . Let’s just say the Our Father together. ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. . . .’” And after he concludes, he makes the sign of the cross, and appears to wait expectantly for you and the other prospective voters to do so too.</p>
<p id="fc693e9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are an immigrant attending a naturalization ceremony to finally become a citizen. The presiding official tells you and your fellow applicants that before administering the oath of allegiance, he would like a minister to pray for you and with you. The pastor steps to the front of the room, asks everyone to bow their heads, and recites: “[F]ather, son, and Holy Spirit—it is with a due sense of reverence and awe that we come before you [today] seeking your blessing. . . . You are . . . a wise God, oh Lord, . . . as evidenced even in the plan of redemption that is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We ask that you would give freely and abundantly wisdom to one and to all . . . in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who lives with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>
<p id="fc693e9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would hold that the government officials responsible for the above practices—that is, for prayer repeatedly invoking a single religion’s beliefs in these settings—crossed a constitutional line. I have every confidence the Court would agree.</p>
<p id="fc693e9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why? The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christianity as such. This opinion is full of Christian prayers, because those were the only invocations offered in the Town of Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the prayer of some other religion, the outcome would be exactly the same. Suppose, for example, that government officials in a predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to begin all public functions with a chanting of the Sh’ma and V’ahavta. (“Hear O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. . . . Bind [these words] as a sign upon your hand; let them be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house, and on your gates.”) Or assume officials in a mostly Muslim town requested a muezzin to commence such functions, over and over again, with a recitation of the Adhan. (“God is greatest, God is greatest. I bear witness that there is no deity but God. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.”) In any instance, the question would be why such government-sponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the constitutional pale.</p>
<p id="fc693ea0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One glaring problem is that the government in all these hypotheticals has aligned itself with, and placed its imprimatur on, a particular religious creed. “The clearest command of the Establishment Clause,” this Court has held, “is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.”</p>
<p id="fc693ea1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By authorizing and overseeing prayers associated with a single religion—to the exclusion of all others—the government officials in my hypothetical cases (whether federal, state, or local does not matter) have violated that foundational principle. They have embarked on a course of religious favoritism anathema to the First Amendment. And making matters still worse: They have done so in a place where individuals come to interact with, and participate in, the institutions and processes of their government. And so a civic function of some kind brings religious differences to the fore: That public proceeding becomes (whether intentionally or not) an instrument for dividing her from adherents <span title="1761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1761">p. 1761</span>to the community’s majority religion, and for altering the very nature of her relationship with her government.</p>
<p id="fc693ea2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is not the country we are, because that is not what our Constitution permits. Here, when a citizen stands before her government, whether to perform a service or request a benefit, her religious beliefs do not enter into the picture.</p>

<p id="fc693ea4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both Greece’s and the majority’s view, everything I have discussed is irrelevant here because this case involves “the tradition of legislative prayer outlined” in Marsh v. Chambers. And before I dispute the Town and Court, I want to give them their due: They are right that, under <i>Marsh</i>, legislative prayer has a distinctive constitutional warrant by virtue of tradition. As the Court today describes, a long history, stretching back to the first session of Congress (when chaplains began to give prayers in both Chambers). And so I agree with the majority that the issue here is “whether the prayer practice in the Town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.”</p>
<p id="fc693ea5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that question. Instead, the prayers given in Greece, addressed directly to the Town’s citizenry, were <i>more</i> sectarian, and <i>less</i> inclusive, than anything this Court sustained in <i>Marsh</i>. For those reasons, the prayer in Greece departs from the legislative tradition that the majority takes as its benchmark.</p>
<p id="fc693ea6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Marsh</i> upheld prayer addressed to legislators alone, in a proceeding in which citizens had no role—and even then, only when it did not “proselytize or advance” any single religion. It was that legislative prayer practice (not every prayer in a body exercising any legislative function) that the Court found constitutional given its “unambiguous and unbroken history.” But that approved practice, as I have shown, is not Greece’s. None of the history <i>Marsh</i> cited—and none the majority details today—supports calling on citizens to pray, in a manner consonant with only a single religion’s beliefs, at a participatory public proceeding, having both legislative and adjudicative components. Or to use the majority’s phrase, no “history shows that th[is] specific practice is permitted.” And so, contra the majority, Greece’s prayers cannot simply ride on the constitutional coattails of the legislative tradition <i>Marsh</i> described. The Board’s practice must, in its own particulars, meet constitutional requirements.</p>
<p id="fc693ea7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the guideposts for addressing that inquiry include the principles of religious neutrality I discussed earlier. The government (whether federal, state, or local) may not favor, or align itself with, any particular creed. And that is nowhere more true than when officials and citizens come face to face in their shared institutions of governance. In performing civic functions and seeking civic benefits, each person of this nation must experience a government that belongs to one and all, irrespective of belief. And for its part, each government must ensure that its participatory processes will not classify those citizens by faith, or make relevant their religious differences.</p>
<p id="fc693ea8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But Greece could not do what it did: infuse a participatory government body with one (and only one) faith, so that month in and month out, the citizens appearing before it become partly defined by their creed — as those who share, and those who do not, the community’s majority religious belief. In this country, when citizens go before the government, they go not as Christians or Muslims <span title="1762" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1762">p. 1762</span>or Jews (or what have you), but just as Americans (or here, as Grecians). That is what it means to be an equal citizen, irrespective of religion. And that is what the Town of Greece precluded by so identifying</p>

After suits were filed charging violations of the Establishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a resolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent legal code.” The result in each instance was a modified display of the Commandments surrounded by texts containing religious references as their sole common element.

In McCreary County, the placement of the Commandments responded to an order of the county legislative body requiring “the display [to] be posted in ‘a very high traffic area’ of the courthouse.” In Pulaski County, amidst reported controversy over the propriety of the display, the Commandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county Judge-Executive, who called them “good rules to live by” and who recounted the story of an astronaut who became convinced “there must be a divine God” after viewing the Earth from the moon.</p>
<p id="fc6965c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 1999, respondents American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky et al. sued the Counties in Federal District Court and sought a preliminary injunction against maintaining the displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of the prohibition of religious establishment included in the First Amendment of the Constitution. Within a month, and before the District Court had responded to the request for injunction, the legislative body of each County authorized a second, expanded display, by nearly identical resolutions reciting that the Ten Commandments are “the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of . . . Kentucky are founded,” and stating several grounds for taking that position: that “the Ten Commandments are codified in Kentucky’s civil and criminal laws”; that the Kentucky House of Representatives had in 1993 “voted unanimously . . . to adjourn . . . ‘in remembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics’”; that the “County Judge and . . . magistrates agree with the arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore” in defense of his “display [of] the Ten Commandments in his courtroom”; and that the “Founding Father[s] [had an] explicit understanding of the duty of elected officials to publicly acknowledge God as the source of America’s strength and direction.”</p>
<p id="fc6965c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As directed by the resolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten Commandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of the resolution, which instructed that it, too, be posted. In addition to the first display’s large framed copy of the edited King James version of the Commandments, the second included eight other documents in smaller frames, each either having a religious theme or excerpted to highlight a religious element. The documents were the “endowed by their Creator” passage from the Declaration of Independence; the Preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky; the national motto, “In God We Trust”; a page from the Congressional Record of February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and including a statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln designating April 30, 1863, a National Day of Prayer and Humiliation; an excerpt from President Lincoln’s “Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon Presentation of a Bible,” reading that “[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man”; a proclamation by President Reagan marking 1983 the Year of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compact.</p>

Stone v. Graham (1980). <i>Stone</i> found a predominantly <span title="1764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1764">p. 1764</span>religious purpose in the government’s posting of the Commandments, given their prominence as “‘an instrument of religion.’” The Counties ask for a different approach here by arguing that official purpose is unknowable and the search for it inherently vain.</p>

<p id="fc698cdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) summarized the three familiar considerations for evaluating Establishment Clause claims, looking to whether government action has “a secular legislative purpose” has been a common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of our cases. Though we have found government action motivated by an illegitimate purpose only four times since <i>Lemon</i>, and “the secular purpose requirement alone may rarely be determinative . . . , it nevertheless serves an important function.”</p>
<p id="fc698cde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The touchstone for our analysis is the principle that the “First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.” When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the government’s ostensible object is to take sides. Manifesting a purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion generally, clashes with the “understanding, reached . . . after decades of religious war, that liberty and social stability demand a religious tolerance that respects the religious views of all citizens. . . .” By showing a purpose to favor religion, the government “sends the . . . message to . . . nonadherents ‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members. . . .’”</p>

<p id="fc698ce0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of Establishment Clause values, the Counties ask us to abandon <i>Lemon</i>’s purpose test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their first argument is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to them, true “purpose” is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent. The assertions are as seismic as they are unconvincing.</p>
<p id="fc698ce1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation that makes up the daily fare of every appellate court in the country, and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitutional doctrine, e.g., Washington v. Davis (1976) (discriminatory purpose required for Equal Protection violation); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n (1977) (discriminatory purpose relevant to dormant Commerce Clause claim); Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993) (discriminatory purpose raises level of scrutiny required by free exercise claim). With enquiries into purpose this common, if they were nothing but hunts for mares’ nests deflecting attention from bare judicial will, the whole notion of purpose in law would have dropped into disrepute long ago.</p>
<p id="fc698ce2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense, as in Establishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter’s heart <span title="1765" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1765">p. 1765</span>of hearts. The eyes that look to purpose belong to an “objective observer,” one who takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the “text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute,” or comparable official act. There is, then, nothing hinting at an unpredictable or disingenuous exercise when a court enquires into purpose after a claim is raised under the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc698ce3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there any indication that the enquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every time a case is filed. In the past, the test has not been fatal very often, presumably because government does not generally act unconstitutionally, with the predominant purpose of advancing religion.</p>
<p id="fc698ce4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lemon</i> said that government action must have “a secular . . . purpose,” and after a host of cases it is fair to add that although a legislature’s stated reasons will generally get deference, the secular purpose required has to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective.</p>

<p id="fc698ce6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We take <i>Stone</i> as the initial legal benchmark, our only case dealing with the constitutionality of displaying the Commandments. <i>Stone</i> recognized that the Commandments are an “instrument of religion” and that, at least on the facts before it, the display of their text could presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law specifically required their posting in public school classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not leave room even for an argument that secular education explained their being there.</p>
<p id="fc698ce7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to deny that the Commandments have had influence on civil or secular law; a major text of a majority religion is bound to be felt. The point is simply that the original text viewed in its entirety is an unmistakably religious statement dealing with religious obligations and with morality subject to religious sanction. When the government initiates an effort to place this statement alone in public view, a religious object is unmistakable.</p>
<p id="fc698ce8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold only that purpose needs to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and needs to be understood in light of context; an implausible claim that governmental purpose has changed should not carry the day in a court of law any more than in a head with common sense. It is enough to say here that district courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief to take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant conditions.</p>
<p id="fc698ce9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we have occasion here to hold that a sacred text can never be integrated constitutionally into a governmental display on the subject of law, or American history. We do not forget, and in this litigation have frequently been reminded, that our own courtroom frieze was deliberately designed in the exercise of governmental authority so as to include the figure of Moses holding tablets exhibiting a portion of the Hebrew text of the later, secularly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the National Government was violating neutrality in religion.</p>

<p id="fc698ceb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent, however, puts forward a limitation on the application of the neutrality principle, with citations to historical evidence said to show that the Framers understood the ban on establishment of religion as sufficiently narrow to allow the government to espouse submission to the divine will. The dissent identifies God as the God of monotheism, all of whose three principal strains (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) acknowledge the religious importance of the Ten Commandments. On the dissent’s view, it apparently follows that even rigorous espousal of a common element of this common monotheism is consistent with the establishment ban.</p>
<p id="fc698cec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the dissent’s argument for the original understanding is flawed from the outset by its failure to consider the full range of evidence showing what the Framers believed. The dissent is certainly correct in putting forward evidence that some of the Framers thought some endorsement of religion was compatible with the establishment ban.</p>
<p id="fc698ced-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the fact is that we do have more to go on, for there is also evidence supporting the proposition that the Framers intended the Establishment Clause to require governmental neutrality in matters of religion, including neutrality in statements acknowledging religion. The very language of the Establishment Clause represented a significant departure from early drafts that merely prohibited a single national religion, and the final language instead “extended [the] prohibition to state support for ‘religion’ in general.”</p>
<p id="fc698cee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical record, moreover, is complicated beyond the dissent’s account by the writings and practices of figures no less influential than Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Jefferson, for example, refused to issue Thanksgiving Proclamations because he believed that they violated the Constitution. And Madison, whom the dissent claims as supporting its thesis, criticized Virginia’s general assessment tax not just because it required people to donate “three pence” to religion, but because “it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.”</p>
<p id="fc69b3ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fair inference is that there was no common understanding about the limits of the establishment prohibition, and the dissent’s conclusion that its narrower view was the original understanding stretches the evidence beyond tensile capacity. What the evidence does show is a group of statesmen, like others before and after them, who proposed a guarantee with contours not wholly worked out, leaving the Establishment Clause with edges still to be determined. And none the worse for that. Indeterminate edges are the kind to have in a constitution meant to endure, and to meet “exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for as they occur.”</p>
<p id="fc69b400-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the dissent fails to show a consistent original understanding from which to argue that the neutrality principle should be rejected, it does manage to deliver a surprise. As mentioned, the dissent says that the deity the Framers had in mind was the God of monotheism, with the consequence that government may espouse a tenet of traditional monotheism. This is truly a remarkable view. Today’s dissent, however, apparently means that government should be free to approve the core beliefs of a favored religion over the tenets of others, a view that should trouble anyone who prizes religious liberty. Certainly history cannot justify it; on the contrary, history shows that the religion of concern to <span title="1767" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1767">p. 1767</span>the Framers was not that of the monotheistic faiths generally, but Christianity in particular, a fact that no member of this Court takes as a premise for construing the Religion Clauses.</p>
<p id="fc69b401-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historical evidence thus supports no solid argument for changing course (whatever force the argument might have when directed at the existing precedent), whereas public discourse at the present time certainly raises no doubt about the value of the interpretative approach invoked for 60 years now. We are centuries away from the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre and the treatment of heretics in early Massachusetts, but the divisiveness of religion in current public life is inescapable. This is no time to deny the prudence of understanding the Establishment Clause to require the Government to stay neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of the individual.</p>
<p id="fc69b402-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc69b403-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join in the Court’s opinion. The First Amendment expresses our Nation’s fundamental commitment to religious liberty by means of two provisions—one protecting the free exercise of religion, the other barring establishment of religion. They were written by the descendents of people who had come to this land precisely so that they could practice their religion freely. Together with the other First Amendment guarantees—of free speech, a free press, and the rights to assemble and petition—the Religion Clauses were designed to safeguard the freedom of conscience and belief that those immigrants had sought. They embody an idea that was once considered radical: Free people are entitled to free and diverse thoughts, which government ought neither to constrain nor to direct.</p>
<p id="fc69b404-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reasonable minds can disagree about how to apply the Religion Clauses in a given case. But the goal of the Clauses is clear: to carry out the Founders’ plan of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.</p>
<p id="fc69b405-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By enforcing the Clauses, we have kept religion a matter for the individual conscience, not for the prosecutor or bureaucrat. At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the assumption of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. The well-known statement that “[w]e are a religious people” has proved true. Americans attend their places of worship more often than do citizens of other developed nations, and describe religion as playing an especially important role in their lives. Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly?</p>
<p id="fc69b406-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we enforce these restrictions, we do so for the same reason that guided the Framers—respect for religion’s special role in society. Our Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to voluntary religious expression, and provided for the possibility of judicial intervention when government action threatens or impedes such expression. Voluntary religious belief and expression may be as threatened when government takes the mantle of religion upon itself as when government directly interferes with private religious practices. When the government associates one set of religious beliefs with the state and identifies nonadherents as outsiders, it encroaches upon the individual’s decision about whether and how to worship. In the marketplace of ideas, the government <span title="1768" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1768">p. 1768</span>has vast resources and special status. Government religious expression therefore risks crowding out private observance and distorting the natural interplay between competing beliefs. Allowing government to be a potential mouthpiece for competing religious ideas risks the sort of division that might easily spill over into suppression of rival beliefs. Tying secular and religious authority together poses risks to both.</p>
<p id="fc69b407-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the history of this particular display of the Ten Commandments, the Court correctly finds an Establishment Clause violation. The purpose behind the counties’ display is relevant because it conveys an unmistakable message of endorsement to the reasonable observer. It is true that many Americans find the Commandments in accord with their personal beliefs. But we do not count heads before enforcing the First Amendment. Nor can we accept the theory that Americans who do not accept the Commandments’ validity are outside the First Amendment’s protections. There is no list of approved and disapproved beliefs appended to the First Amendment—and the Amendment’s broad terms do not admit of such a cramped reading.</p>
<p id="fc69b408-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We owe our First Amendment to a generation with a profound commitment to religion and a profound commitment to religious liberty—visionaries who held their faith “with enough confidence to believe that what should be rendered to God does not need to be decided and collected by Caesar.” In my opinion, the display at issue was an establishment of religion in violation of our Constitution.</p>

<p id="fc69b40c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is one model of the relationship between church and state—a model spread across Europe by the armies of Napoleon, and reflected in the Constitution of France, which begins “France is [a] . . . secular . . . Republic.” France Const., Art. 1. Religion is to be strictly excluded from the public forum. This is not, and never was, the model adopted by America. George Washington added to the form of Presidential oath prescribed by Art. II, §1, cl. 8, of the Constitution, the concluding words “so help me God.” The Supreme Court under John Marshall opened its sessions with the prayer, “God save the United States and this Honorable Court.” The First Congress instituted the practice of beginning its legislative sessions with a prayer. The same week that Congress submitted the Establishment Clause as part of the Bill of Rights for ratification by the States, it enacted legislation providing for paid chaplains in the House and Senate. The day after the First Amendment was proposed, the same Congress that had proposed it requested the President to proclaim “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed, by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the many and signal <span title="1769" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1769">p. 1769</span>favours of Almighty God.” President Washington offered the first Thanksgiving Proclamation shortly thereafter, devoting November 26, 1789, on behalf of the American people “‘to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that is, that was, or that will be,’” thus beginning a tradition of offering gratitude to God that continues today. The same Congress also reenacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance of 1787, Article III of which provided: “Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” And of course the First Amendment itself accords religion (and no other manner of belief) special constitutional protection.</p>
<p id="fc69b40d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These actions of our First President and Congress and the Marshall Court were not idiosyncratic; they reflected the beliefs of the period. Those who wrote the Constitution believed that morality was essential to the well-being of society and that encouragement of religion was the best way to foster morality. The “fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself.”</p>
<p id="fc69b40e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor have the views of our people on this matter significantly changed. Presidents continue to conclude the Presidential oath with the words “so help me God.” Our legislatures, state and national, continue to open their sessions with prayer led by official chaplains. The sessions of this Court continue to open with the prayer “God save the United States and this Honorable Court.” Invocation of the Almighty by our public figures, at all levels of government, remains commonplace. Our coinage bears the motto “IN GOD WE TRUST.” And our Pledge of Allegiance contains the acknowledgment that we are a Nation “under God.” As one of our Supreme Court opinions rightly observed, “We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.” Zorach v. Clauson (1952).</p>
<p id="fc69b40f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With all of this reality (and much more) staring it in the face, how can the Court possibly assert that “the First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between . . . religion and nonreligion,” and that “[m]anifesting a purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion generally,” is unconstitutional? Who says so? Surely not the words of the Constitution. Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our society’s constant understanding of those words. Surely not even the current sense of our society, recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives, criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional. Nothing stands behind the Court’s assertion that governmental affirmation of the society’s belief in God is unconstitutional except the Court’s own say-so, citing as support only the unsubstantiated say-so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century. And it is, moreover, a thoroughly discredited say-so. It is discredited, to begin with, because a majority of the Justices on the current Court (including at least one Member of today’s majority) have, in separate opinions, repudiated the brain-spun “<i>Lemon</i> test” that embodies the supposed principle of neutrality between religion and irreligion. And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage (or the foolhardiness) to apply the neutrality principle consistently.</p>
<p id="fc69b410-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides appealing to the demonstrably false principle that the government cannot favor religion over irreligion, today’s opinion suggests that the posting of the Ten Commandments violates the principle that the government cannot favor one religion over another. That is indeed a valid principle where public <span title="1770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1770">p. 1770</span>aid or assistance to religion is concerned, or where the free exercise of religion is at issue, but it necessarily applies in a more limited sense to public acknowledgment of the Creator. If religion in the public forum had to be entirely nondenominational, there could be no religion in the public forum at all. One cannot say the word “God,” or “the Almighty,” one cannot offer public supplication or thanksgiving, without contradicting the beliefs of some people that there are many gods, or that God or the gods pay no attention to human affairs. With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our Nation’s historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists. The Thanksgiving Proclamation issued by George Washington at the instance of the First Congress was scrupulously nondenominational—but it was monotheistic. In Marsh v. Chambers (1983), we said that the fact the particular prayers offered in the Nebraska Legislature were “in the Judeo-Christian tradition” posed no additional problem, because “there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.”</p>
<p id="fc69b411-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historical practices thus demonstrate that there is a distance between the acknowledgment of a single Creator and the establishment of a religion. The former is, as Marsh v. Chambers put it, “a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.” The three most popular religions in the United States, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—which combined account for 97.7% of all believers—are monotheistic. All of them, moreover (Islam included), believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life. Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable, insofar as discriminating against other religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the population—from Christians to Muslims—that they cannot be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint.</p>
<p id="fc69b412-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I must respond to Justice Stevens’ assertion that I would “marginaliz[e] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans” who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic. Surely that is a gross exaggeration. The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause, and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator. Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment, but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment. Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate competing interests: On the one hand, the interest of that minority in not feeling “excluded”; but on the other, the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication as a people, and with respect to our national endeavors. Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority.</p>

<p id="fc69b414-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As bad as the <i>Lemon</i> test is, it is worse for the fact that, since its inception, its seemingly simple mandates have been manipulated to fit whatever result the <span title="1771" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1771">p. 1771</span>Court aimed to achieve. Today’s opinion is no different. In two respects it modifies <i>Lemon</i> to ratchet up the Court’s hostility to religion. First, the Court justifies inquiry into legislative purpose, not as an end itself, but as a means to ascertain the appearance of the government action to an “‘objective observer.’” Because in the Court’s view the true danger to be guarded against is that the objective observer would feel like an “outside[r]” or “not [a] full membe[r] of the political community,” its inquiry focuses not on the actual purpose of government action, but the “purpose apparent from government action.” Under this approach, even if a government could show that its actual purpose was not to advance religion, it would presumably violate the Constitution as long as the Court’s objective observer would think otherwise.</p>
<p id="fc69db25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence that bases the unconstitutionality of a government practice that does not actually advance religion on the hopes of the government that it would do so. But that oddity pales in comparison to the one invited by today’s analysis: the legitimacy of a government action with a wholly secular effect would turn on the misperception of an imaginary observer that the government officials behind the action had the intent to advance religion.</p>
<p id="fc69db26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court replaces <i>Lemon</i>’s requirement that the government have “a secular . . . purpose” with the heightened requirement that the secular purpose “predominate” over any purpose to advance religion. The Court treats this extension as a natural outgrowth of the longstanding requirement that the government’s secular purpose not be a sham, but simple logic shows the two to be unrelated. If the government’s proffered secular purpose is not genuine, then the government has no secular purpose at all. The new demand that secular purpose predominate contradicts <i>Lemon</i>’s more limited requirement, and finds no support in our cases.</p>
<p id="fc69db27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have urged that <i>Lemon</i>’s purpose prong be abandoned, because (as I have discussed in Part I) even an exclusive purpose to foster or assist religious practice is not necessarily invalidating. But today’s extension makes things even worse. By shifting the focus of <i>Lemon</i>’s purpose prong from the search for a genuine, secular motivation to the hunt for a predominantly religious purpose, the Court converts what has in the past been a fairly limited inquiry into a rigorous review of the full record. Those responsible for the adoption of the Religion Clauses would surely regard it as a bitter irony that the religious values they designed those Clauses to protect have now become so distasteful to this Court that if they constitute anything more than a subordinate motive for government action they will invalidate it.</p>

<p id="fc69db29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even accepting the Court’s <i>Lemon</i>-based premises, the displays at issue here were constitutional. To any person who happened to walk down the hallway of the McCreary or Pulaski County Courthouse during the roughly nine months when the Foundations Displays were exhibited, the displays must have seemed unremarkable—if indeed they were noticed at all. The walls of both courthouses were already lined with historical documents and other assorted portraits; each Foundations Display was exhibited in the same format as these other displays and nothing in the record suggests that either County took steps to give <span title="1772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1772">p. 1772</span>it greater prominence. On its face, the Foundations Displays manifested the purely secular purpose that the Counties asserted before the District Court: “to display documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.” That the Displays included the Ten Commandments did not transform their apparent secular purpose into one of impermissible advocacy for Judeo-Christian beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc69db2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Acknowledgment of the contribution that religion has made to our Nation’s legal and governmental heritage partakes of a centuries-old tradition. Display of the Ten Commandments is well within the mainstream of this practice of acknowledgment. Federal, State, and local governments across the Nation have engaged in such display. The Supreme Court Building itself includes depictions of Moses with the Ten Commandments in the Courtroom and on the east pediment of the building, and symbols of the Ten Commandments “adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom.” Similar depictions of the Decalogue appear on public buildings and monuments throughout our Nation’s Capital. The frequency of these displays testifies to the popular understanding that the Ten Commandments are a foundation of the rule of law, and a symbol of the role that religion played, and continues to play, in our system of government.</p>

<p id="fc6a0241-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question here is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds. We hold that it does.</p>
<p id="fc6a0242-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State Capitol contain 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the “people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity.” The monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and 31/2 feet wide. It is located to the north of the Capitol building, between the Capitol and the Supreme Court building. Its primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription “PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961.”</p>
<p id="fc6a0243-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative record surrounding the State’s acceptance of the monument from the Eagles—a national social, civic, and patriotic organization—is limited to legislative journal entries. After the monument was accepted, the State selected a site for the monument based on the recommendation of the state organization responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The Eagles paid the cost of erecting the monument, the dedication of which was presided over by two state legislators.</p>
<p id="fc6a0244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan and a resident of Austin. At one time he was a licensed lawyer, having graduated from Southern Methodist <span title="1773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1773">p. 1773</span>Law School. Van Orden testified that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds. Forty years after the monument’s erection and six years after Van Orden began to encounter the monument frequently, he sued numerous state officials in their official capacities seeking both a declaration that the monument’s placement violates the Establishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal.</p>
<p id="fc6a0245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions in applying the Establishment Clause. One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation’s history. The other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom.</p>
<p id="fc6a0246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, like all Establishment Clause challenges, presents us with the difficulty of respecting both faces. Our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their citizens. One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation’s heritage, while the other looks to the present in demanding a separation between church and state. Reconciling these two faces requires that we neither abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion by disabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religious heritage.</p>
<p id="fc6a0247-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case we are faced with a display of the Ten Commandments on government property outside the Texas State Capitol. Such acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation’s heritage are common throughout America. We need only look within our own Courtroom. Since 1935, Moses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the south frieze. Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom. Moses also sits on the exterior east facade of the building holding the Ten Commandments tablets.</p>
<p id="fc6a0248-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout a visitor’s tour of our Nation’s Capital. For example, a large statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul, has overlooked the rotunda of the Library of Congress’ Jefferson Building since 1897. And the Jefferson Building’s Great Reading Room contains a sculpture of a woman beside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from the Old Testament (Micah 6:8). A medallion with two tablets depicting the Ten Commandments decorates the floor of the National Archives. Inside the Department of Justice, a statue entitled “The Spirit of Law” has two tablets representing the Ten Commandments lying at its feet. In front of the Ronald Reagan Building is another sculpture that includes a depiction of the Ten Commandments. So too a 24-foot-tall sculpture, depicting, among other things, the Ten Commandments and a cross, stands outside the federal courthouse that houses both the Court of Appeals and the District Court for the District of Columbia. Moses is also prominently featured in the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives.</p>
<p id="fc6a0249-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the Ten Commandments are religious—they were so viewed at their inception and so remain. The monument, therefore, has religious significance. According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious leader. And the Ten Commandments have an undeniable historical meaning, <span title="1774" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1774">p. 1774</span>as the foregoing examples demonstrate. Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc6a295a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are, of course, limits to the display of religious messages or symbols. For example, we held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom. Stone v. Graham (1980) (per curiam). In the classroom context, we found that the Kentucky statute had an improper and plainly religious purpose.</p>
<p id="fc6a295b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in <i>Stone</i>, where the text confronted elementary school students every day. Indeed, Van Orden, the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number of years before bringing this lawsuit. Texas has treated her Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the State’s political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government. We cannot say that Texas’ display of this monument violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc6a295c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc6a295d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case would be easy if the Court were willing to abandon the inconsistent guideposts it has adopted for addressing Establishment Clause challenges, and return to the original meaning of the Clause. I have previously suggested that the Clause’s text and history “resis[t] incorporation” against the States. If the Establishment Clause does not restrain the States, then it has no application here, where only state action is at issue.</p>
<p id="fc6a295e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Clause is incorporated, or if the Free Exercise Clause limits the power of States to establish religions, our task would be far simpler if we returned to the original meaning of the word “establishment” than it is under the various approaches this Court now uses. The Framers understood an establishment “necessarily [to] involve actual legal coercion.” “In other words, establishment at the founding involved, for example, mandatory observance or mandatory payment of taxes supporting ministers.” And “government practices that have nothing to do with creating or maintaining . . . coercive state establishments” simply do not “implicate the possible liberty interest of being free from coercive state establishments.”</p>
<p id="fc6a295f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question that, based on the original meaning of the Establishment Clause, the Ten Commandments display at issue here is constitutional. In no sense does Texas compel petitioner Van Orden to do anything. The only injury to him is that he takes offense at seeing the monument as he passes it on his way to the Texas Supreme Court Library. He need not stop to read it or even to look at it, let alone to express support for it or adopt the Commandments as guides for his life. The mere presence of the monument along his path involves no coercion and thus does not violate the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc6a2960-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the very “flexibility” of this Court’s Establishment Clause precedent leaves it incapable of consistent application. The inconsistency between the decisions the Court reaches today in this case and in McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky. (2005) only compounds the confusion.</p>
<p id="fc6a2961-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much, if not all, of this would be avoided if the Court would return to the views of the Framers and adopt coercion as the touchstone for our Establishment <span title="1775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1775">p. 1775</span>Clause inquiry. Every acknowledgment of religion would not give rise to an Establishment Clause claim. Courts would not act as theological commissions, judging the meaning of religious matters. Most important, our precedent would be capable of consistent and coherent application. While the Court correctly rejects the challenge to the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol grounds, a more fundamental rethinking of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains in order.</p>
<p id="fc6a2962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc6a2963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp (1963), Justice Goldberg, joined by Justice Harlan, wrote, in respect to the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses, that there is “no simple and clear measure which by precise application can readily and invariably demark the permissible from the impermissible.” One must refer instead to the basic purposes of those Clauses. They seek to “assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all.” They seek to avoid that divisiveness based upon religion that promotes social conflict, sapping the strength of government and religion alike. They seek to maintain that “separation of church and state” that has long been critical to the “peaceful dominion that religion exercises in [this] country,” where the “spirit of religion” and the “spirit of freedom” are productively “united,” “reign[ing] together” but in separate spheres “on the same soil.”</p>
<p id="fc6a2964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has made clear, as Justices Goldberg and Harlan noted, that the realization of these goals means that government must “neither engage in nor compel religious practices,” that it must “effect no favoritism among sects or between religion and nonreligion,” and that it must “work deterrence of no religious belief.” The government must avoid excessive interference with, or promotion of, religion. But the Establishment Clause does not compel the government to purge from the public sphere all that in any way partakes of the religious. Such absolutism is not only inconsistent with our national traditions, but would also tend to promote the kind of social conflict the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.</p>
<p id="fc6a2965-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments’ text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.</p>
<p id="fc6a2966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In certain contexts, a display of the tablets of the Ten Commandments can convey not simply a religious message but also a secular moral message (about proper standards of social conduct). And in certain contexts, a display of the tablets can also convey a historical message (about a historic relation between those standards and the law)—a fact that helps to explain the display of those tablets in dozens of courthouses throughout the Nation, including the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p id="fc6a2967-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here the tablets have been used as part of a display that communicates not simply a religious message, but a secular message as well. The circumstances surrounding the display’s placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting suggest that the State itself intended the latter, nonreligious aspects of the <span title="1776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1776">p. 1776</span>tablets’ message to predominate. And the monument’s 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that that has been its effect.</p>
<p id="fc6a2968-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a private civic (and primarily secular) organization, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments’ role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization’s efforts to combat juvenile delinquency. The Eagles’ consultation with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text underscores the group’s ethics-based motives. The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display, a factor which, though not sufficient, thereby further distances the State itself from the religious aspect of the Commandments’ message.</p>
<p id="fc6a2969-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The physical setting of the monument, moreover, suggests little or nothing of the sacred. The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the “ideals” of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time. The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity. But it does provide a context of history and moral ideals. It (together with the display’s inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State’s citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed.</p>
<p id="fc6a296a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments’ text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets’ message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.</p>
<p id="fc6a507b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, moreover, is distinguishable from instances where the Court has found Ten Commandments displays impermissible. The display is not on the grounds of a public school, where, given the impressionability of the young, government must exercise particular care in separating church and state. This case also differs from <i>McCreary County</i>, where the short (and stormy) history of the courthouse Commandments’ displays demonstrates the substantially religious objectives of those who mounted them, and the effect of this readily apparent objective upon those who view them. That history there indicates a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an effort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously inspired document. And, in today’s world, in a Nation of so many different religious and comparable nonreligious fundamental beliefs, a more contemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing monument has not.</p>
<p id="fc6a507c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, I believe that the Texas display—serving a mixed but primarily nonreligious purpose, not primarily “advanc[ing]” or “inhibit[ing] religion,” and not creating an “excessive government entanglement with religion”—might satisfy this Court’s more formal Establishment Clause tests. But, as I have said, in reaching the conclusion that the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line, I rely less upon a literal application <span title="1777" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1777">p. 1777</span>of any particular test than upon consideration of the basic purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses themselves. This display has stood apparently uncontested for nearly two generations. That experience helps us understand that as a practical matter of degree this display is unlikely to prove divisive. And this matter of degree is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one.</p>
<p id="fc6a507d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, to reach a contrary conclusion here, based primarily on the religious nature of the tablets’ text would, I fear, lead the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions. Such a holding might well encourage disputes concerning the removal of longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public buildings across the Nation. And it could thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.</p>

<p id="fc6a507f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole function of the monument on the grounds of Texas’ State Capitol is to display the full text of one version of the Ten Commandments. The monument is not a work of art and does not refer to any event in the history of the State. Viewed on its face, Texas’ display has no purported connection to God’s role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation; nor does it provide the reasonable observer with any basis to guess that it was erected to honor any individual or organization. The message transmitted by Texas’ chosen display is quite plain: This State endorses the divine code of the “Judeo-Christian” God.</p>
<p id="fc6a5080-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For those of us who learned to recite the King James version of the text long before we understood the meaning of some of its words, God’s Commandments may seem like wise counsel. The question before this Court, however, is whether it is counsel that the State of Texas may proclaim without violating the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. If any fragment of Jefferson’s metaphorical “wall of separation between church and State” is to be preserved—if there remains any meaning to the “wholesome ‘neutrality’ of which this Court’s [Establishment Clause] cases speak”—a negative answer to that question is mandatory.</p>
<p id="fc6a5081-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my judgment, at the very least, the Establishment Clause has created a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property. The adornment of our public spaces with displays of religious symbols and messages undoubtedly provides comfort, even inspiration, to many individuals who subscribe to particular faiths. Unfortunately, the practice also runs the risk of “offend[ing] nonmembers of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular advertisement disrespectful.” Government’s obligation to avoid divisiveness and exclusion in the religious sphere is compelled by the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, which together erect a wall of separation between church and state.</p>
<p id="fc6a5082-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The monolith displayed on Texas Capitol grounds cannot be discounted as a passive acknowledgment of religion, nor can the State’s refusal to remove it upon objection be explained as a simple desire to preserve a historic relic. This Nation’s resolute commitment to neutrality with respect to religion is flatly inconsistent with the plurality’s wholehearted validation of an official state endorsement of the message that there is one, and only one, God.</p>
<p id="fc6a5083-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason this message stands apart is that the Decalogue is a venerable religious text. As we held 25 years ago, it is beyond dispute that “[t]he Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths.” For many followers, the Commandments represent the literal word of God as <span title="1778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1778">p. 1778</span>spoken to Moses and repeated to his followers after descending from Mount Sinai. Attempts to secularize what is unquestionably a sacred text defy credibility and disserve people of faith.</p>
<p id="fc6a5084-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The profoundly sacred message embodied by the text inscribed on the Texas monument is emphasized by the especially large letters that identify its author: “I AM the LORD thy God.” It commands present worship of Him and no other deity. It directs us to be guided by His teaching in the current and future conduct of all of our affairs. It instructs us to follow a code of divine law, some of which has informed and been integrated into our secular legal code (“Thou shalt not kill”), but much of which has not (“Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images. . . . Thou shalt not covet”).</p>
<p id="fc6a5085-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, despite the Eagles’ best efforts to choose a benign nondenominational text, the Ten Commandments display projects not just a religious, but an inherently sectarian message. There are many distinctive versions of the Decalogue, ascribed to by different religions and even different denominations within a particular faith; to a pious and learned observer, these differences may be of enormous religious significance. In choosing to display this version of the Commandments, Texas tells the observer that the State supports this side of the doctrinal religious debate.</p>
<p id="fc6a5086-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if, however, the message of the monument, despite the inscribed text, fairly could be said to represent the belief system of all Judeo-Christians, it would still run afoul of the Establishment Clause by prescribing a compelled code of conduct from one God, namely a Judeo-Christian God, that is rejected by prominent polytheistic sects, such as Hinduism, as well as nontheistic religions, such as Buddhism. And, at the very least, the text of the Ten Commandments impermissibly commands a preference for religion over irreligion. Any of those bases, in my judgment, would be sufficient to conclude that the message should not be proclaimed by the State of Texas on a permanent monument at the seat of its government.</p>
<p id="fc6a5087-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality relies heavily on the fact that our Republic was founded, and has been governed since its nascence, by leaders who spoke then (and speak still) in plainly religious rhetoric. The speeches and rhetoric characteristic of the founding era, however, do not answer the question before us. I have already explained why Texas’ display of the full text of the Ten Commandments, given the content of the actual display and the context in which it is situated, sets this case apart from the countless examples of benign government recognitions of religion. But there is another crucial difference. Our leaders, when delivering public addresses, often express their blessings simultaneously in the service of God and their constituents. Thus, when public officials deliver public speeches, we recognize that their words are not exclusively a transmission from the government because those oratories have embedded within them the inherently personal views of the speaker as an individual member of the polity. The permanent placement of a textual religious display on state property is different in kind; it amalgamates otherwise discordant individual views into a collective statement of government approval. Moreover, the message never ceases to transmit itself to objecting viewers whose only choices are to accept the message or to ignore the offense by averting their gaze. In this sense, although Thanksgiving Day proclamations and inaugural speeches undoubtedly seem official, in most circumstances they will not constitute the sort of governmental endorsement of religion at which the separation of church and state is aimed.</p>
<p id="fc6a5088-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1779" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1779">p. 1779</span>The plurality’s reliance on early religious statements and proclamations made by the Founders is also problematic because those views were not espoused at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 nor enshrined in the Constitution’s text. The original understanding of the type of “religion” that qualified for constitutional protection under the Establishment Clause likely did not include those followers of Judaism and Islam who are among the preferred “monotheistic” religions Justice Scalia has embraced in his <i>McCreary County</i> opinion. Given the original understanding of the men who championed our “Christian nation”—men who had no cause to view anti-Semitism or contempt for atheists as problems worthy of civic concern—one must ask whether Justice Scalia “has not had the courage (or the foolhardiness) to apply [his originalism] principle consistently.”</p>
<p id="fc6a5089-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, to constrict narrowly the reach of the Establishment Clause to the views of the Founders would lead to more than this unpalatable result; it would also leave us with an unincorporated constitutional provision—in other words, one that limits only the federal establishment of “a national religion.” Under this view, not only could a State constitutionally adorn all of its public spaces with crucifixes or passages from the New Testament, it would also have full authority to prescribe the teachings of Martin Luther or Joseph Smith as the official state religion. Only the Federal Government would be prohibited from taking sides (and only then as between Christian sects).</p>
<p id="fc6a508a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A reading of the First Amendment dependent on either of the purported original meanings expressed above would eviscerate the heart of the Establishment Clause. It would replace Jefferson’s “wall of separation” with a perverse wall of exclusion—Christians inside, non-Christians out. It would permit States to construct walls of their own choosing—Baptists inside, Mormons out; Jewish Orthodox inside, Jewish Reform out. A Clause so understood might be faithful to the expectations of some of our Founders, but it is plainly not worthy of a society whose enviable hallmark over the course of two centuries has been the continuing expansion of religious pluralism and tolerance.</p>
<p id="fc6a508b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our duty, therefore, to interpret the First Amendment’s command that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion” not by merely asking what those words meant to observers at the time of the founding, but instead by deriving from the Clause’s text and history the broad principles that remain valid today. The principle that guides my analysis is neutrality. The basis for that principle is firmly rooted in our Nation’s history and our Constitution’s text. I recognize that the requirement that government must remain neutral between religion and irreligion would have seemed foreign to some of the Framers; so too would a requirement of neutrality between Jews and Christians. The evil of discriminating today against atheists, “polytheists[,] and believers in unconcerned deities,” is in my view a direct descendent of the evil of discriminating among Christian sects. The Establishment Clause thus forbids it and, in turn, forbids Texas from displaying the Ten Commandments monument the plurality so casually affirms.</p>
<p id="fc6a508c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Court in this case stands for the proposition that the Constitution permits governmental displays of sacred religious texts. This makes a mockery of the constitutional ideal that government must remain neutral between religion and irreligion. If a State may endorse a particular deity’s command to “have no other gods before me,” it is difficult to conceive of any textual display that would run afoul of the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p id="fc6a779e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses have not been read to mandate absolute governmental neutrality toward religion, the Establishment Clause requires neutrality as a general rule, and thus expresses Madison’s condemnation of “employ[ing] Religion as an engine of Civil policy.” A governmental display of an obviously religious text cannot be squared with neutrality, except in a setting that plausibly indicates that the statement is not placed in view with a predominant purpose on the part of government either to adopt the religious message or to urge its acceptance by others.</p>
<p id="fc6a779f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, only one of our cases addressed the constitutionality of posting the Ten Commandments, Stone v. Graham (1980). A Kentucky statute required posting the Commandments on the walls of public school classrooms. [The Court stated:]</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc6a77a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature. The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact. The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one’s parents, killing or murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord’s name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.”</p>
</div>
<p id="fc6a77a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What these observations underscore are the simple realities that the Ten Commandments constitute a religious statement, that their message is inherently religious, and that the purpose of singling them out in a display is clearly the same.</p>
<p id="fc6a77a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To drive the religious point home, and identify the message as religious to any viewer who failed to read the text, the engraved quotation is framed by religious symbols: two tablets with what appears to be ancient script on them, two Stars of David, and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho as the familiar monogram of Christ. Nothing on the monument, in fact, detracts from its religious nature, and the plurality does not suggest otherwise. It would therefore be difficult to miss the point that the government of Texas is telling everyone who sees the monument to live up to a moral code because God requires it, with both code and conception of God being rightly understood as the inheritances specifically of Jews and Christians. And it is likewise unsurprising that the District Court expressly rejected Texas’s argument that the State’s purpose in placing the monument on the capitol grounds was related to the Commandments’ role as “part of the foundation of modern secular law in Texas and elsewhere.”</p>
<p id="fc6a77a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The monument’s presentation of the Commandments with religious text emphasized and enhanced stands in contrast to any number of perfectly constitutional depictions of them, the frieze of our own Courtroom providing a good example, where the figure of Moses stands among history’s great lawgivers. While Moses holds the tablets of the Commandments showing some Hebrew text, no one looking at the lines of figures in marble relief is likely to see a religious purpose behind the assemblage or take away a religious message from it. Only one other depiction represents a religious leader, and the historical personages <span title="1781" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1781">p. 1781</span>are mixed with symbols of moral and intellectual abstractions like Equity and Authority. Since Moses enjoys no especial prominence on the frieze, viewers can readily take him to be there as a lawgiver in the company of other lawgivers; and the viewers may just as naturally see the tablets of the Commandments (showing the later ones, forbidding things like killing and theft, but without the divine preface) as background from which the concept of law emerged, ultimately having a secular influence in the history of the Nation. Government may, of course, constitutionally call attention to this influence, and may post displays or erect monuments recounting this aspect of our history no less than any other, so long as there is a context and that context is historical. Hence, a display of the Commandments accompanied by an exposition of how they have influenced modern law would most likely be constitutionally unobjectionable. And the Decalogue could, as <i>Stone</i> suggested, be integrated constitutionally into a course of study in public schools.</p>
<p id="fc6a77a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas seeks to take advantage of the recognition that visual symbol and written text can manifest a secular purpose in secular company, when it argues that its monument (like Moses in the frieze) is not alone and ought to be viewed as only 1 among 17 placed on the 22 acres surrounding the state capitol. Texas, indeed, says that the Capitol grounds are like a museum for a collection of exhibits, the kind of setting that several Members of the Court have said can render the exhibition of religious artifacts permissible, even though in other circumstances their display would be seen as meant to convey a religious message forbidden to the State.</p>
<p id="fc6a77a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But 17 monuments with no common appearance, history, or esthetic role scattered over 22 acres is not a museum, and anyone strolling around the lawn would surely take each memorial on its own terms without any dawning sense that some purpose held the miscellany together more coherently than fortuity and the edge of the grass. One monument expresses admiration for pioneer women. One pays respect to the fighters of World War II. In like circumstances, we rejected an argument similar to the State’s, noting in <i>County of Allegheny</i> that “[t]he presence of Santas or other Christmas decorations elsewhere in the . . . [c]ourthouse, and of the nearby gallery forum, fail to negate the [cr&amp;#x00E8;che’s] endorsement effect. . . . The record demonstrates . . . that the cr&amp;#x00E8;che, with its floral frame, was its own display distinct from any other decorations or exhibitions in the building.”</p>
<p id="fc6a77a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor can the plurality deflect <i>Stone</i> by calling the Texas monument “a far more passive use of [the Decalogue] than was the case in <i>Stone</i>, where the text confronted elementary school students every day.” Placing a monument on the ground is not more “passive” than hanging a sheet of paper on a wall when both contain the same text to be read by anyone who looks at it. The problem in <i>Stone</i> was simply that the State was putting the Commandments there to be seen, just as the monument’s inscription is there for those who walk by it.</p>
<p id="fc6a77a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The monument in this case sits on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. There is something significant in the common term “statehouse” to refer to a state capitol building: it is the civic home of every one of the State’s citizens. If neutrality in religion means something, any citizen should be able to visit that civic home without having to confront religious expressions clearly meant to convey an official religious position that may be at odds with his own religion, or with rejection of religion.</p>

Eighty-nine years after the dedication of the Cross, respondents filed this lawsuit, claiming that they are offended by the sight of the memorial on public land and that its presence there and the expenditure of public funds to maintain it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. To remedy this violation, they asked a federal court to order the relocation or demolition of the Cross or at least the removal of its arms. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the memorial is unconstitutional and remanded for a determination of the proper remedy. We now reverse.</p>
<p id="fc6a77af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the cross has long been a preeminent Christian symbol, its use in the Bladensburg memorial has a special significance. After the First World War, the picture of row after row of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers who had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned on the minds of Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as the Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that historical context. For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community’s grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought. It has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of “a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.” And contrary to respondents’ intimations, there is no evidence of discriminatory intent in the selection of the design of the memorial or the decision of a Maryland commission to maintain it. The Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, and the presence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood for so many years is fully consistent with that aim.</p>

Many of these marks relate to health care, and it is likely that the association of the cross with healing had a religious origin. But the current use of these marks is indisputably secular.</p>
<p id="fc6a77b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The familiar symbol of the Red Cross—a red cross on a white background—shows how the meaning of a symbol that was originally religious can be transformed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) selected that symbol in 1863 because it was thought to call to mind the flag of Switzerland, a <span title="1783" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1783">p. 1783</span>country widely known for its neutrality. The Swiss flag consists of a white cross on a red background. In an effort to invoke the message associated with that flag, the ICRC copied its design with the colors inverted. Thus, the ICRC selected this symbol for an essentially secular reason, and the current secular message of the symbol is shown by its use today in nations with only tiny Christian populations. But the cross was originally chosen for the Swiss flag for religious reasons. So an image that began as an expression of faith was transformed.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ec4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The image used in the Bladensburg memorial—a plain Latin cross—also took on new meaning after World War I. “During and immediately after the war, the army marked soldiers’ graves with temporary wooden crosses or Stars of David”—a departure from the prior practice of marking graves in American military cemeteries with uniform rectangular slabs. The vast majority of these grave markers consisted of crosses, and thus when Americans saw photographs of these cemeteries, what struck them were rows and rows of plain white crosses. As a result, the image of a simple white cross “developed into a ‘central symbol’” of the conflict. Contemporary literature, poetry, and art reflected this powerful imagery. Perhaps most famously, John McCrae’s poem, In Flanders Fields, began with these memorable lines:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fc6a9ec5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>Between the crosses, row on row.”</p>
</div>

<p id="fc6a9ec6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognition of the cross’s symbolism extended to local communities across the country. In late 1918, residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland, formed a committee for the purpose of erecting a memorial for the county’s fallen soldiers. Among the committee’s members were the mothers of 10 deceased soldiers. The committee decided that the memorial should be a cross and hired sculptor and architect John Joseph Earley to design it.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ec7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Cross was to stand at the terminus of another World War I memorial—the National Defense Highway, which connects Washington to Annapolis. The community gathered for a joint groundbreaking ceremony for both memorials on September 28, 1919; the mother of the first Prince George’s County resident killed in France broke ground for the Cross.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ec8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The completed monument is a 32-foot tall Latin cross that sits on a large pedestal. The American Legion’s emblem is displayed at its center, and the words “Valor,” “Endurance,” “Courage,” and “Devotion” are inscribed at its base, one on each of the four faces. The pedestal also features a 9- by 2.5-foot bronze plaque explaining that the monument is “Dedicated to the heroes of Prince George’s County, Maryland who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.”</p>
<p id="fc6a9ec9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2012, nearly 90 years after the Cross was dedicated and more than 50 years after the Commission acquired it, the American Humanist Association (AHA) lodged a complaint with the Commission. The complaint alleged that the Cross’s presence on public land and the Commission’s maintenance of the memorial violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>

<p id="fc6a9ecb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” While the concept of a <span title="1784" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1784">p. 1784</span>formally established church is straightforward, pinning down the meaning of a “law respecting an establishment of religion” has proved to be a vexing problem. After grappling with such cases for more than 20 years, <i>Lemon</i> ambitiously attempted to distill from the Court’s existing case law a test that would bring order and predictability to Establishment Clause decisionmaking. That test, as noted, called on courts to examine the purposes and effects of a challenged government action, as well as any entanglement with religion that it might entail. The Court later elaborated that the “effect[s]” of a challenged action should be assessed by asking whether a “reasonable observer” would conclude that the action constituted an “endorsement” of religion.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ecc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For at least four reasons, the <i>Lemon</i> test presents particularly daunting problems in cases, including the one now before us, that involve the use, for ceremonial, celebratory, or commemorative purposes, of words or symbols with religious associations. Together, these considerations counsel against efforts to evaluate such cases under <i>Lemon</i> and toward application of a presumption of constitutionality for longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ecd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First</i>, these cases often concern monuments, symbols, or practices that were first established long ago, and in such cases, identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ece-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>, as time goes by, the purposes associated with an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ecf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Third,</i> just as the purpose for maintaining a monument, symbol, or practice may evolve, “[t]he ‘message’ conveyed . . . may change over time.” Consider, for example, the message of the Statue of Liberty, which began as a monument to the solidarity and friendship between France and the United States and only decades later came to be seen “as a beacon welcoming immigrants to a land of freedom.” With sufficient time, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices can become embedded features of a community’s landscape and identity.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the same way, consider the many cities and towns across the United States that bear religious names. Religion undoubtedly motivated those who named Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Las Cruces, New Mexico; Providence, Rhode Island; Corpus Christi, Texas; Nephi, Utah, and the countless other places in our country with names that are rooted in religion. Yet few would argue that this history requires that these names be erased from the map.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, when time’s passage imbues a religiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with this kind of familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no longer appear neutral, especially to the local community for which it has taken on particular meaning. A government that roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine will strike many as aggressively hostile to religion. Militantly secular regimes have carried out such projects in the past, and for those with a knowledge of history, the image of monuments being taken down will be evocative, disturbing, and divisive.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These four considerations show that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones. The passage of time gives rise to a strong presumption of constitutionality.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The role of the cross in World War I memorials is illustrative of each of the four preceding considerations. Immediately following the war, “[c]ommunities across America built memorials to commemorate those who had served the <span title="1785" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1785">p. 1785</span>nation in the struggle to make the world safe for democracy.” “[T]he First World War witnessed a dramatic change in . . . the symbols used to commemorate th[e] service” of the fallen soldiers. In the wake of the war, the United States adopted the cross as part of its military honors, establishing the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross in 1918 and 1919, respectively. And as already noted, the fallen soldiers’ final resting places abroad were marked by white crosses or Stars of David. The solemn image of endless rows of white crosses became inextricably linked with and symbolic of the ultimate price paid by 116,000 soldiers. And this relationship between the cross and the war undoubtedly influenced the design of the many war memorials that sprang up across the Nation.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that the cross’s association with the war was the sole or dominant motivation for the inclusion of the symbol in every World War I memorial that features it. But today, it is all but impossible to tell whether that was so. The passage of time means that testimony from those actually involved in the decisionmaking process is generally unavailable, and attempting to uncover their motivations invites rampant speculation. And no matter what the original purposes for the erection of a monument, a community may wish to preserve it for very different reasons, such as the historic preservation and traffic-safety concerns the Commission has pressed here.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the passage of time may have altered the area surrounding a monument in ways that change its meaning and provide new reasons for its preservation. Such changes are relevant here, since the Bladensburg Cross now sits at a busy traffic intersection, and numerous additional monuments are located nearby.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, as World War I monuments have endured through the years and become a familiar part of the physical and cultural landscape, requiring their removal would not be viewed by many as a neutral act. A monument may express many purposes and convey many different messages, both secular and religious. Thus, a campaign to obliterate items with religious associations may evidence hostility to religion even if those religious associations are no longer in the forefront.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the <i>Lemon</i> Court ambitiously attempted to find a grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause, in later cases, we have taken a more modest approach that focuses on the particular issue at hand and looks to history for guidance. Our cases involving prayer before a legislative session are an example.</p>
<p id="fc6a9ed8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prevalence of this philosophy at the time of the founding is reflected in other prominent actions taken by the First Congress. It requested—and President Washington proclaimed—a national day of prayer and it reenacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance, which provided that “[r]eligion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” President Washington echoed this sentiment in his Farewell Address, calling religion and morality “indispensable supports” to “political prosperity.”</p>

<p id="fc6ac5ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles, we conclude that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause. As we have explained, the Bladensburg Cross carries special significance in commemorating World War I. Due in large part to the image of the simple wooden crosses that originally marked the graves of <span title="1786" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1786">p. 1786</span>American soldiers killed in the war, the cross became a symbol of their sacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be understood in light of that background. That the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World War I memorials.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only did the Bladensburg Cross begin with this meaning, but with the passage of time, it has acquired historical importance. It reminds the people of Bladensburg and surrounding areas of the deeds of their predecessors and of the sacrifices they made in a war fought in the name of democracy. As long as it is retained in its original place and form, it speaks as well of the community that erected the monument nearly a century ago and has maintained it ever since. The memorial represents what the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the fallen soldiers felt at the time and how they chose to express their sentiments. And the monument has acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years. The Cross now stands among memorials to veterans of later wars. It has become part of the community.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The monument would not serve that role if its design had deliberately disrespected area soldiers who perished in World War I. More than 3,500 Jewish soldiers gave their lives for the United States in that conflict, and some have wondered whether the names of any Jewish soldiers from the area were deliberately left off the list on the memorial or whether the names of any Jewish soldiers were included on the Cross against the wishes of their families.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, it is surely relevant that the monument commemorates the death of particular individuals. It is natural and appropriate for those seeking to honor the deceased to invoke the symbols that signify what death meant for those who are memorialized. And this is why the memorial for soldiers from the Bladensburg community features the cross—the same symbol that marks the graves of so many of their comrades near the battlefields where they fell.</p>

<p id="fc6ac5ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent. For some, that monument is a symbolic resting place for ancestors who never returned home. For others, it is a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices for our Nation. For others still, it is a historical landmark. For many of these people, destroying or defacing the Cross that has stood undisturbed for nearly a century would not be neutral and would not further the ideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kagan</span> joins, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have long maintained that there is no single formula for resolving Establishment Clause challenges. The Court must instead consider each case in light of the basic purposes that the Religion Clauses were meant to serve: assuring religious liberty and tolerance for all, avoiding religiously based social conflict, and maintaining that separation of church and state that allows each to flourish in its “separate spher[e].”</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that allowing the State of Maryland to display and maintain the Peace Cross poses no threat to those ends. The Court’s opinion <span title="1787" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1787">p. 1787</span>eloquently explains why that is so: The Latin cross is uniquely associated with the fallen soldiers of World War I; the organizers of the Peace Cross acted with the undeniably secular motive of commemorating local soldiers; no evidence suggests that they sought to disparage or exclude any religious group; the secular values inscribed on the Cross and its place among other memorials strengthen its message of patriotism and commemoration; and, finally, the Cross has stood on the same land for 94 years, generating no controversy in the community until this lawsuit was filed. Nothing in the record suggests that the lack of public outcry “was due to a climate of intimidation.” In light of all these circumstances, the Peace Cross cannot reasonably be understood as “a government effort to favor a particular religious sect” or to “promote religion over nonreligion.” And, as the Court explains, ordering its removal or alteration at this late date would signal “a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.”</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case would be different, in my view, if there were evidence that the organizers had “deliberately disrespected” members of minority faiths or if the Cross had been erected only recently, rather than in the aftermath of World War I. But those are not the circumstances presented to us here, and I see no reason to order <i>this</i> cross torn down simply because <i>other</i> crosses would raise constitutional concerns.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do I understand the Court’s opinion today to adopt a “history and tradition test” that would permit any newly constructed religious memorial on public land. The Court appropriately “looks to history for guidance,” but it upholds the constitutionality of the Peace Cross only after considering its particular historical context and its long-held place in the community. A newer memorial, erected under different circumstances, would not necessarily be permissible under this approach.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kavanaugh</span>, concurring.</p>

<p id="fc6ac5f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consistent with the Court’s case law, the Court today applies a history and tradition test in examining and upholding the constitutionality of the Bladensburg Cross. As this case again demonstrates, this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971).</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion identifies five relevant categories of Establishment Clause cases: (1) religious symbols on government property and religious speech at government events; (2) religious accommodations and exemptions from generally applicable laws; (3) government benefits and tax exemptions for religious organizations; (4) religious expression in public schools; and (5) regulation of private religious speech in public forums. The <i>Lemon</i> test does not explain the Court’s decisions in any of those five categories.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practice of displaying religious memorials, particularly religious war memorials, on public land is not coercive and is rooted in history and tradition.

<p id="fc6ac5fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bladensburg Cross commemorates soldiers who gave their lives for America in World War I. I agree with the Court that the Bladensburg Cross is <span title="1788" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1788">p. 1788</span>constitutional. At the same time, I have deep respect for the plaintiffs’ sincere objections to seeing the cross on public land. I have great respect for the Jewish war veterans who in an <i>amicus</i> brief say that the cross on public land sends a message of exclusion. I recognize their sense of distress and alienation. Moreover, I fully understand the deeply religious nature of the cross. It would demean both believers and nonbelievers to say that the cross is not religious, or not all that religious. A case like this is difficult because it represents a clash of genuine and important interests. Applying our precedents, we uphold the constitutionality of the cross. In doing so, it is appropriate to also restate this bedrock constitutional principle: All citizens are equally American, no matter what religion they are, or if they have no religion at all.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that the cross does not violate the Establishment Clause does not necessarily mean that those who object to it have no other recourse. The Court’s ruling <i>allows</i> the State to maintain the cross on public land. The Court’s ruling does not <i>require</i> the State to maintain the cross on public land. The Maryland Legislature could enact new laws requiring removal of the cross or transfer of the land. The Maryland Governor or other state or local executive officers may have authority to do so under current Maryland law. And if not, the legislature could enact new laws to authorize such executive action. The Maryland Constitution, as interpreted by the Maryland Court of Appeals, may speak to this question. And if not, the people of Maryland can amend the State Constitution.</p>
<p id="fc6ac5fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those alternative avenues of relief illustrate a fundamental feature of our constitutional structure: This Court is not the <i>only</i> guardian of individual rights in America. This Court fiercely protects the individual rights secured by the U. S. Constitution. But the Constitution sets a floor for the protection of individual rights. The constitutional floor is sturdy and often high, but it is a floor. Other federal, state, and local government entities generally possess authority to safeguard individual rights above and beyond the rights secured by the U. S. Constitution.</p>

<p id="fc6ac5ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The text and history of this Clause suggest that it should not be incorporated against the States. Even if the Clause expresses an individual right enforceable against the States, it is limited by its text to “law[s]” enacted by a legislature, so it is unclear whether the Bladensburg Cross would implicate any incorporated right. And even if it did, this religious display does not involve the type of actual legal coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion. Therefore, the Cross is clearly constitutional.</p>

Today, the Court explains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to demand the destruction of longstanding monuments, and I find much of its opinion compelling. In my judgment, however, it follows from the Court’s analysis that suits like this one should be dismissed for lack of standing. Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment to reverse and remand the court of appeals’ decision, I would do so with additional instructions to dismiss the case.</p>

Maybe, the Association concedes, others who are less offended lack standing to sue. Maybe others still who are equally affected but who come into contact with the memorial too infrequently lack standing as well. But, the Association assures us, its members are offended enough—and with sufficient frequency—that they may sue.</p>
<p id="fc6aed13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This “offended observer” theory of standing has no basis in law. Federal courts may decide only those cases and controversies that the Constitution and Congress have authorized them to hear. Unsurprisingly, this Court has already rejected the notion that offense alone qualifies as a “concrete and particularized” injury sufficient to confer standing. Offended observer standing cannot be squared with this Court’s longstanding teachings about the limits of Article III.</p>
<p id="fc6aed14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a large and diverse country, offense can be easily found.

But recourse for disagreement and offense does not lie in federal litigation. Instead, in a society that holds among its most cherished ambitions mutual respect, tolerance, self-rule, and democratic responsibility, an “offended viewer” may “avert his eyes,” or pursue a political solution. Today’s decision represents a welcome step toward restoring this Court’s recognition of these truths, and I respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>

<p id="fc6aed16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An immense Latin cross stands on a traffic island at the center of a busy three-way intersection in Bladensburg, Maryland. “[M]onumental, clear, and bold” by day, the cross looms even larger illuminated against the night-time sky.</p>
<p id="fc6aed17-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Decades ago, this Court recognized that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution demands governmental neutrality among religious faiths, and between religion and nonreligion. Numerous times since, the Court has reaffirmed the Constitution’s commitment to neutrality. Today the Court erodes that neutrality commitment, diminishing precedent designed to preserve individual liberty and civic harmony in favor of a “presumption of constitutionality for longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices.”</p>
<p id="fc6aed18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Latin cross is the foremost symbol of the Christian faith, embodying the “central theological claim of Christianity: that the son of God died on the cross, that he rose from the dead, and that his death and resurrection offer the possibility of eternal life.” Precisely because the cross symbolizes these sectarian beliefs, it is a common marker for the graves of Christian soldiers. For the same reason, using the cross as a war memorial does not transform it into a secular symbol. Just as a Star of David is not suitable to honor Christians who died serving their country, so a cross is not suitable to honor those of other faiths who died defending their nation. Soldiers of all faiths “are united by their love of country, but they are not united by the cross.”</p>
<p id="fc6aed19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By maintaining the Peace Cross on a public highway, the Commission elevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over nonreligion. Memorializing the service of American soldiers is an “admirable and unquestionably secular” objective. But the Commission does not serve that objective by displaying a symbol that bears “a starkly sectarian message.”</p>
<p id="fc6aed1a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1790" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1790">p. 1790</span>Holding the Commission’s display of the Peace Cross unconstitutional would not, as the Commission fears, “inevitably require the destruction of other cross-shaped memorials throughout the country.” When a religious symbol appears in a public cemetery—on a headstone, or as the headstone itself, or perhaps integrated into a larger memorial—the setting counters the inference that the government seeks “either to adopt the religious message or to urge its acceptance by others.” In a cemetery, the “privately selected religious symbols on individual graves are best understood as the private speech of each veteran.” Such displays are “linked to, and sho[w] respect for, the individual honoree’s faith and beliefs.” They do not suggest governmental endorsement of those faith and beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc6aed1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing that a Latin cross does not belong on a public highway or building does not mean the monument must be “torn down.” “[L]ike the determination of the violation itself,” the “proper remedy . . . is necessarily context specific.” In some instances, the violation may be cured by relocating the monument to private land or by transferring ownership of the land and monument to a private party.</p>

<p id="fc6aed1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many Establishment Clause cases have involved the issue of government assistance to religion. Decisions in this area are numerous but often difficult to reconcile. The Court inevitably is involved in line drawing. Total government subsidy of churches or parochial schools undoubtedly would violate the Establishment Clause. Indeed, James Madison’s <i>Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments</i> was made in the context of opposing a state tax to aid the church.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN115BC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N115BC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">50</a></span> But it also would be clearly unconstitutional if the government provided no public services—no police or fire protection, no sanitation services—to religious institutions. Such discrimination surely would violate equal protection and infringe free exercise of religion.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN115C5_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N115C5_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">51</a></span></p>
<p id="fc6aed21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, the Court must draw a line between aid that is permissible and that which is forbidden. No bright line test exists or likely ever will be developed. Any aid provided to a religious institution or a parochial school frees resources that can be used to further its religious mission.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN115D3_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N115D3_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">52</a></span> The dominant approach for the past quarter of a century has been to apply the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman, presented above, and to ask whether there is a secular purpose for the assistance, whether the aid has the effect of advancing religion, and whether the particular form of assistance causes excessive government entanglement with religion. But not every case has used the <i>Lemon</i> test.</p>
<p id="fc6aed23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1791" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1791">p. 1791</span>There have been four major areas where the Court has considered government aid to religion: assistance to parochial elementary and secondary schools; tax exemptions for religious institutions; aid to religious colleges and universities; and assistance to religious institutions other than schools. Each of these is considered below in turn. By far, most cases have concerned aid to religious elementary and secondary schools, and it thus receives the most attention.</p>

<p id="fc6b1436-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has considered the constitutionality of a vast array of different types of assistance, ranging from tuition tax credits to textbooks to audiovisual equipment to medical diagnostic tests to many other kinds of aid.

<p id="fc6b143d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1997, the Court signaled a likely shift to its approach to the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997), the Court held that public school remedial education teachers may provide instruction in private schools. In doing so, the Court overruled a decision from a decade earlier, Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402 (1985), which held that such instruction violates the Establishment Clause. <i>Agostini</i> was a five-to-four decision, and the majority opinion was written by Justice O’Connor and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas.</p>
<p id="fc6b143e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the end of the majority opinion, Justice O’Connor appeared to state a new test for the Establishment Clause: “To summarize, New York City’s Title I program does not run afoul of any of the three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: it does not result in government indoctrination; define its recipient by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.” Justice O’Connor presents this as if it is restating existing law, and yet this seems to articulate a new approach that aid to parochial schools is unconstitutional only if the government participates in indoctrinating religion, or if the government discriminates among religions, or if there is excessive government entanglement with religion.</p>
<p id="fc6b143f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Mitchell v. Helms, several of the opinions discuss this aspect of Justice O’Connor’s opinion in <i>Agostini</i>. In <i>Mitchell</i>, the Supreme Court reconsidered whether the government violates the Establishment Clause when it provides <span title="1792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1792">p. 1792</span>instructional equipment to parochial schools. Earlier, in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975), the Court declared unconstitutional a state law that provided instructional materials, including audiovisual equipment, to parochial schools. In reconsidering this issue, the justices expressed their views as to the more general issue: What aid to parochial school violates the Establishment Clause? There is no majority opinion, but instead several different answers to this question.</p>

<p id="fc6b3b56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of a longstanding school aid program known as Chapter 2, the Federal Government distributes funds to state and local governmental agencies, which in turn lend educational materials and equipment to public and private schools, with the enrollment of each participating school determining the amount of aid that it receives. The question is whether Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, is a law respecting an establishment of religion, because many of the private schools receiving Chapter 2 aid in that parish are religiously affiliated. We hold that Chapter 2 is not such a law.</p>

<p id="fc6b3b58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, has its origins in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), and is a close cousin of the provision of the ESEA that we recently considered in Agostini v. Felton (1997). Like the provision at issue in <i>Agostini</i>, Chapter 2 channels federal funds to local educational agencies (LEA’s), which are usually public school districts, via state educational agencies (SEA’s), to implement programs to assist children in elementary and secondary schools. Among other things, Chapter 2 provides aid “for the acquisition and use of instructional and educational materials, including library services and materials (including media materials), assessments, reference materials, computer software and hardware for instructional use, and other curricular materials.”</p>
<p id="fc6b3b59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several restrictions apply to aid to private schools. Most significantly, the “services, materials, and equipment” provided to private schools must be “secular, neutral, and nonideological.” In addition, private schools may not acquire control of Chapter 2 funds or title to Chapter 2 materials, equipment, or property. A private school receives the materials and equipment by submitting to the LEA an application detailing which items the school seeks and how it will use them; the LEA, if it approves the application, purchases those items from the school’s allocation of funds, and then lends them to that school.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Jefferson Parish (the Louisiana governmental unit at issue in this case), as in Louisiana as a whole, private schools have primarily used their allocations for nonrecurring expenses, usually materials and equipment. In the 1986-1987 fiscal year, for example, 44% of the money budgeted for private schools in Jefferson Parish was spent by LEA’s for acquiring library and media materials, <span title="1793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1793">p. 1793</span>and 48% for instructional equipment. Among the materials and equipment provided have been library books, computers, and computer software, and also slide and movie projectors, overhead projectors, television sets, tape recorders, VCR’s, projection screens, laboratory equipment, maps, globes, filmstrips, slides, and cassette recordings.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that, in an average year, about 30% of Chapter 2 funds spent in Jefferson Parish are allocated for private schools. For the 1985-1986 fiscal year, 41 private schools participated in Chapter 2. For the following year, 46 participated, and the participation level has remained relatively constant since then. Of these 46, 34 were Roman Catholic; 7 were otherwise religiously affiliated; and 5 were not religiously affiliated.</p>

<p id="fc6b3b5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” In the over 50 years since <i>Everson</i>, we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Agostini</i>, however, we brought some clarity to our case law, by overruling two anomalous precedents and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test. Whereas in <i>Lemon</i> we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, in <i>Agostini</i> we modified <i>Lemon</i> for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors. We acknowledged that our cases discussing excessive entanglement had applied many of the same considerations as had our cases discussing primary effect, and we therefore recast <i>Lemon</i>’s entanglement inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining a statute’s effect. We also acknowledged that our cases had pared somewhat the factors that could justify a finding of excessive entanglement.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We then set out revised criteria for determining the effect of a statute: “To summarize, New York City’s Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.”</p>
<p id="fc6b3b60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, our inquiry under <i>Agostini</i>’s purpose and effect test is a narrow one. Because respondents do not challenge the District Court’s holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, we will consider only Chapter 2’s effect. Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two <i>Agostini</i> criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court’s holding, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement. Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent case law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion. We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a “law respecting an establishment of religion.” In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable—<i>Meek</i> and <i>Wolman</i> are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<span title="1794" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1794">p. 1794</span><div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc6b3b61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fc6b3b62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we indicated in <i>Agostini</i>, and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action. We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid “subsidizes” religion, as our religion cases use that term.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion. If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government. For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question. If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular indoctrination. To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose. The government, in crafting such an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so “only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals.” We have viewed as significant whether the “private choices of individual parents,” as opposed to the “unmediated” will of government, determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much. For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment. Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Witters</i> and <i>Mueller</i> employed similar reasoning. In <i>Witters</i>, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.</p>
<p id="fc6b3b66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in <i>Mueller</i> was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in <i>Witters</i>. We upheld it chiefly because it “neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,” and because “numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,” determined which schools would benefit from the deductions. We explained that “[w]here, as here, aid to parochial schools is available only as a result of decisions of individual parents no ‘imprimatur of state approval’ can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.”</p>
<p id="fc6b3b67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1795">p. 1795</span>We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under <i>Agostini’</i>s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children. For any aid will have some such effect.</p>

<p id="fc6b6179-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion. They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonincidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible. Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermissible. Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent case law and we therefore reject them.</p>
<p id="fc6b617a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although some of our earlier cases did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion. As even the dissent all but admits, our more recent cases address this purpose not through the direct/indirect distinction but rather through the principle of private choice, as incorporated in the first <i>Agostini</i> criterion (i.e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government). If aid to schools, even “direct aid,” is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has not provided any “support of religion.” Although the presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the hands of individuals—which is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, there is no reason why the Establishment Clause requires such a form.</p>
<p id="fc6b617b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs. In Board of Education v. Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools could collect students’ requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools’ teaching of secular subjects.</p>
<p id="fc6b617c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, we have seen “special Establishment Clause dangers,” when money is given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in <i>Witters</i> and <i>Mueller</i>; indirectly. But direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a “special” case to create a rule for all cases.</p>
<p id="fc6b617d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use. We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second. Respondents’ “no divertibility” rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable. So long as the governmental aid is not itself “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content,” and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannot be attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern. And, of course, the use to which the aid is put does not affect the criteria governing the aid’s allocation and thus does not create any impermissible incentive under <i>Agostini</i>’s second criterion.</p>
<p id="fc6b617e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1796" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1796">p. 1796</span>The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content. Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school. Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.</p>
<p id="fc6b617f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A concern for divertibility, as opposed to improper content, is misplaced not only because it fails to explain why the sort of aid that we have allowed is permissible, but also because it is boundless—enveloping all aid, no matter how trivial—and thus has only the most attenuated (if any) link to any realistic concern for preventing an “establishment of religion.” Presumably, for example, government-provided lecterns, chalk, crayons, pens, paper, and paintbrushes would have to be excluded from religious schools under respondents’ proposed rule. But we fail to see how indoctrination by means of (i.e., diversion of) such aid could be attributed to the government. In fact, the risk of improper attribution is less when the aid lacks content, for there is no risk (as there is with books), of the government inadvertently providing improper content. Finally, any aid, with or without content, is “divertible” in the sense that it allows schools to “divert” resources. Yet we have “not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.”</p>
<p id="fc6b6180-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is perhaps conceivable that courts could take upon themselves the task of distinguishing among the myriad kinds of possible aid based on the ease of diverting each kind. But it escapes us how a court might coherently draw any such line. It not only is far more workable, but also is actually related to real concerns about preventing advancement of religion by government, simply to require that a program of aid to schools not provide improper content and that it determine eligibility and allocate the aid on a permissible basis.</p>
<p id="fc6b6181-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the dissent’s factors deserves special mention: whether a school that receives aid (or whose students receive aid) is pervasively sectarian. The dissent is correct that there was a period when this factor mattered, particularly if the pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary school. But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.</p>
<p id="fc6b6182-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this factor. First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline. Although our case law has consistently mentioned it even in recent years, we have not struck down an aid program in reliance on this factor since 1985.</p>
<p id="fc6b6183-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government’s secular purpose. If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be. The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.</p>
<p id="fc6b6184-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the inquiry into the recipient’s religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive. It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts should refrain from trolling through a person’s or institution’s religious beliefs.</p>
<p id="fc6b6185-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1797" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1797">p. 1797</span>Finally, hostility to aid to pervasively sectarian schools has a shameful pedigree that we do not hesitate to disavow. Although the dissent professes concern for “the implied exclusion of the less favored,” the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from government-aid programs is just that, particularly given the history of such exclusion. Opposition to aid to “sectarian” schools acquired prominence in the 1870’s with Congress’s consideration (and near passage) of the Blaine Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions. Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that “sectarian” was code for “Catholic.” Notwithstanding its history, of course, “sectarian” could, on its face, describe the school of any religious sect, but the Court eliminated this possibility of confusion when it coined the term “pervasively sectarian”—a term which, at that time, could be applied almost exclusively to Catholic parochial schools and which even today’s dissent exemplifies chiefly by reference to such schools.</p>
<p id="fc6b6186-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, nothing in the Establishment Clause requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs, and other doctrines of this Court bar it. This doctrine, born of bigotry should be buried now.</p>
<p id="fc6b6187-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the two relevant <i>Agostini</i> criteria, we see no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish’s Chapter 2 program “has the effect of advancing religion.” Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination, because it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren, and does not provide aid that has an impermissible content. Nor does Chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to religion.</p>
<p id="fc6b6188-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc6b8899-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address the needs of educationally deprived children of low-income families. Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for use by children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools. Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I and Title II programs several times. I believe that <i>Agostini</i> likewise controls the constitutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals’ judgment that the program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pittenger (1975), and Wolman v. Walter (1977), are inconsistent with the Courts judgment today, I agree that those decisions should be overruled. I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fc6b889a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write separately because, in my view, the plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school-aid programs. Reduced to its essentials, the plurality’s rule states that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content. The plurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid by a religious school to the advancement of its religious mission is permissible. Although the expansive scope of the plurality’s rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the <span title="1798" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1798">p. 1798</span>opinion compel me to write separately. First, the plurality’s treatment of neutrality comes close to assigning that factor singular importance in the future adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges to government school-aid programs. Second, the plurality’s approval of actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is in tension with our precedents and, in any event, unnecessary to decide the instant case.</p>
<p id="fc6b889b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking such a stance, “appears to take evenhanded neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment of the constitutionality of school aid.” I do not quarrel with the plurality’s recognition that neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges. Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid. I also disagree with the plurality’s conclusion that actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is consistent with the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc6b889c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe the distinction between a per-capita school-aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement. In terms of public perception, a government program of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to individual students who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religious schools.</p>
<p id="fc6b889d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the former example, if the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated a message of endorsement. Because the religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion. That the amount of aid received by the school is based on the school’s enrollment does not separate the government from the endorsement of the religious message. The aid formula does not—and could not—indicate to a reasonable observer that the inculcation of religion is endorsed only by the individuals attending the religious school, who each affirmatively choose to direct the secular government aid to the school and its religious mission. No such choices have been made. In contrast, when government aid supports a school’s religious mission only because of independent decisions made by numerous individuals to guide their secular aid to that school, “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts . . . an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief.”</p>
<p id="fc6b889e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the distinction between a per-capita-aid program and a true private-choice program is important when considering aid that consists of direct monetary subsidies. This Court has “recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions.” If, as the plurality contends, a per-capita-aid program is identical in relevant constitutional respects to a true private-choice program, then there is no reason that, under the plurality’s reasoning, the government should be precluded from providing direct money payments to religious organizations (including churches) based on the number of persons belonging to each organization. And, because actual diversion is permissible under the plurality’s holding, the participating religious organizations (including churches) could use that aid to support religious indoctrination. To be sure, the plurality does not actually <span title="1799" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1799">p. 1799</span>hold that its theory extends to direct money payments. That omission, however, is of little comfort. In its logic—as well as its specific advisory language—the plurality opinion foreshadows the approval of direct monetary subsidies to religious organizations, even when they use the money to advance their religious objectives.</p>
<p id="fc6b889f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow. Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I believe that the Court should abandon the presumption adopted in <i>Meek</i> and <i>Wolman</i> respecting the use of instructional materials and equipment by religious-school teachers, I see no constitutional need for pervasive monitoring under the Chapter 2 program. The safeguards employed by the program are constitutionally sufficient. At the federal level, the statute limits aid to “secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials; and equipment”; requires that the aid only supplement and not supplant funds from non-Federal sources; and prohibits “any payment . . . for religious worship or instruction.” At the state level, the Louisiana Department of Education (the relevant SEA for Louisiana) requires all nonpublic schools to submit signed assurances that they will use Chapter 2 aid only to supplement and not to supplant non-Federal funds, and that the instructional materials and equipment “will only be used for secular, neutral and nonideological purposes.” The evidence proffered by respondents concerning actual diversion of Chapter 2 aid in Jefferson Parish is de minimis.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment’s Establishment Clause prohibits Congress (and, by incorporation, the States) from making any law respecting an establishment of religion. It has been held to prohibit not only the institution of an official church, but any government act favoring religion, a particular religion, or for that matter irreligion. Thus it bars the use of public funds for religious aid.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The establishment prohibition of government religious funding serves more than one end. It is meant to guarantee the right of individual conscience against compulsion, to protect the integrity of religion against the corrosion of secular support, and to preserve the unity of political society against the implied exclusion of the less favored and the antagonism of controversy over public support for religious causes.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These objectives are always in some jeopardy since the substantive principle of no aid to religion is not the only limitation on government action toward religion. Because the First Amendment also bars any prohibition of individual free exercise of religion, and because religious organizations cannot be isolated from the basic government functions that create the civil environment, it is as much necessary as it is difficult to draw lines between forbidden aid and lawful benefit. For more than 50 years, this Court has been attempting to draw these lines. Owing to the variety of factual circumstances in which the lines must be drawn, not all of the points creating the boundary have enjoyed self-evidence.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1800" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1800">p. 1800</span>So far as the line drawn has addressed government aid to education, a few fundamental generalizations are nonetheless possible. There may be no aid supporting a sectarian school’s religious exercise or the discharge of its religious mission, while aid of a secular character with no discernible benefit to such a sectarian objective is allowable. Because the religious and secular spheres largely overlap in the life of many such schools, the Court has tried to identify some facts likely to reveal the relative religious or secular intent or effect of the government benefits in particular circumstances. We have asked whether the government is acting neutrally in distributing its money, and about the form of the aid itself, its path from government to religious institution, its divertibility to religious nurture, its potential for reducing traditional expenditures of religious institutions, and its relative importance to the recipient, among other things.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all the years of its effort, the Court has isolated no single test of constitutional sufficiency, and the question in every case addresses the substantive principle of no aid: what reasons are there to characterize this benefit as aid to the sectarian school in discharging its religious mission? Particular factual circumstances control, and the answer is a matter of judgment.</p>
<p id="fc6b88a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least three concerns have been expressed since the founding and run throughout our First Amendment jurisprudence. First, compelling an individual to support religion violates the fundamental principle of freedom of conscience. Madison’s and Jefferson’s now familiar words establish clearly that liberty of personal conviction requires freedom from coercion to support religion, and this means that the government can compel no aid to fund it. Madison put it simply: “[T]he same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment.”</p>
<p id="fc6b88a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, government aid corrupts religion. Madison argued that establishment of religion weakened the beliefs of adherents so favored, strengthened their opponents, and generated “pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; [and] in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.” In a variant of Madison’s concern, we have repeatedly noted that a government’s favor to a particular religion or sect threatens to taint it with “corrosive secularism.”</p>
<p id="fc6b88a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, government establishment of religion is inextricably linked with conflict. In our own history, the turmoil thus produced has led to a rejection of the idea that government should subsidize religious education, a position that illustrates the Court’s understanding that any implicit endorsement of religion is unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fc6b88aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a stand-alone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason. Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group. Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients. Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive <span title="1801" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1801">p. 1801</span>on public money. This is why the consideration of less than universal neutrality has never been recognized as dispositive and has always been teamed with attention to other facts bearing on the substantive prohibition of support for a school’s religious objective.</p>
<p id="fc6bafbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[O]ne point [is] clear beyond peradventure: together with James Madison we have consistently understood the Establishment Clause to impose a substantive prohibition against public aid to religion and, hence, to the religious mission of sectarian schools. Evenhandedness neutrality is one, nondispositive pointer toward an intent and (to a lesser degree) probable effect on the permissible side of the line between forbidden aid and general public welfare benefit. Other pointers are facts about the religious mission and education level of benefited schools and their pupils, the pathway by which a benefit travels from public treasury to educational effect, the form and content of the aid, its adaptability to religious ends, and its effects on school budgets. The object of all enquiries into such matters is the same whatever the particular circumstances: is the benefit intended to aid in providing the religious element of the education and is it likely to do so?</p>
<p id="fc6bafbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts most obviously relevant to the Chapter 2 scheme in Jefferson Parish are those showing divertibility and actual diversion in the circumstance of pervasively sectarian religious schools. The type of aid, the structure of the program, and the lack of effective safeguards clearly demonstrate the divertibility of the aid. While little is known about its use, owing to the anemic enforcement system in the parish, even the thin record before us reveals that actual diversion occurred.</p>
<p id="fc6bafbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The aid that the government provided was highly susceptible to unconstitutional use. Much of the equipment provided under Chapter 2 was not of the type provided for individual students, but included “slide projectors, movie projectors, overhead projectors, television sets, tape recorders, projection screens, maps, globes, filmstrips, cassettes, computers,” and computer software and peripherals, as well as library books and materials. The videocassette players, overhead projectors, and other instructional aids were of the sort that we have found can easily be used by religious teachers for religious purposes. The same was true of the computers, which were as readily employable for religious teaching as the other equipment, and presumably as immune to any countervailing safeguard.</p>
<p id="fc6bafbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The divertibility thus inherent in the forms of Chapter 2 aid was enhanced by the structure of the program in Jefferson Parish. Requests for specific items under Chapter 2 came not from secular officials, but from officials of the religious schools (and even parents of religious school pupils). The sectarian schools decided what they wanted and often ordered the supplies, to be forwarded directly to themselves. It was easy to select whatever instructional materials and library books the schools wanted, just as it was easy to employ computers for the support of the religious content of the curriculum infused with religious instruction.</p>
<p id="fc6bafbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality nonetheless condemns any enquiry into the pervasiveness of doctrinal content as a remnant of anti-Catholic bigotry (as if evangelical Protestant schools and Orthodox Jewish yeshivas were never pervasively sectarian), and it equates a refusal to aid religious schools with hostility to religion (as if aid to religious teaching were not opposed in this very case by at least one religious respondent and numerous religious amici curiae in a tradition claiming descent from Roger Williams). My concern with these arguments goes not <span title="1802" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1802">p. 1802</span>so much to their details as it does to the fact that the plurality’s choice to employ imputations of bigotry and irreligion as terms in the Court’s debate makes one point clear: that in rejecting the principle of no aid to a school’s religious mission the plurality is attacking the most fundamental assumption underlying the Establishment Clause, that government can in fact operate with neutrality in its relation to religion. I believe that it can, and so respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc6bafc0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to Mitchell v. Helms, it was possible to explain most of the cases by seeing them as applying three criteria. First, the aid must be available to all students enrolled in public and parochial schools; aid that is available only to parochial school students is sure to be invalidated. Second, the aid is more likely to be allowed if it is provided directly to the students than if it is provided to the schools. Third, the aid will be permitted if it is a type that likely cannot be used for religions instruction, but it will be invalidated if it can be easily used for religious education. After <i>Mitchell</i>, the first two criteria still seem to be followed by a majority of the justices, but the third criterion seems no longer used.</p>
<p id="fc6bafc1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first factor is whether the aid is available to all students. Aid that is available only to parochial school students is sure to be invalidated, but that same assistance is likely to be allowed if it is given to public school students as well and meets the other criteria. For example, in Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973), and Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. 825 (1973), the Court declared unconstitutional state laws that provided reimbursement and tax credits to students attending nonpublic schools. In <i>Nyquist</i>, a New York statute provided for reimbursement and tax credits for costs of nonpublic school elementary and secondary education for up to one-half of the costs of tuition for low- and middle-income students. Specifically, the law provided for reimbursement payments to families with incomes below $15,000 and tax credits for families with incomes below $25,000. <i>Sloan</i> involved a Pennsylvania law that provided funds to reimburse parents for a portion of tuition expenses incurred in sending their children to nonpublic schools. Unlike the New York law in <i>Nyquist</i>, the Pennsylvania statute allowed families of all incomes to receive funds.</p>
<p id="fc6bafc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court declared both of these laws unconstitutional even though the aid went directly to the families rather than the schools. The Court emphasized that the aid was available only to nonpublic school students. The Court concluded that the aid “has a ‘primary effect that advances religion’ and offends the constitutional prohibition ‘respecting an establishment of religion.’”</p>
<p id="fc6bafc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), discussed by all of the justices in <i>Mitchell</i>, the Court upheld a program of tax credits that were available to all students at both public and parochial schools. A Minnesota law allowed taxpayers to deduct certain expenses incurred in providing education to their children from their state income taxes. The deduction was limited to actual expenses for tuition, textbooks, and transportation and could not exceed $500 per dependent for grades kindergarten through six and $700 per student in grades seven through twelve.</p>
<p id="fc6bafc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By a five-to-four decision, the Court applied the <i>Lemon</i> test and upheld the income tax credits as constitutional. As to the first part of the <i>Lemon</i> test, the Court said that “[a] State’s decision to defray the cost of educational expenses incurred by parents—regardless of the type of schools their children <span title="1803" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1803">p. 1803</span>attend—evidences a purpose that is both secular and understandable. An educated populace is essential to the political and economic health of any community, and a State’s efforts to assist parents in meeting the rising cost of educational expenses plainly serves this secular purpose of ensuring that the State’s citizenry is well educated.”</p>
<p id="fc6bafc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the second prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test, the Court emphasized that the tax credits were one of many deductions available and were limited in size. The Court said that the “[l]egislature’s judgment that a deduction for educational expenses fairly equalizes the tax burden of its citizens and encourages desirable expenditures for educational purposes is entitled to substantial deference.” Most importantly, the Court stressed that the “deduction is available for educational expenses incurred by <i>all</i> parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools.” The Court saw this as the key distinction with <i>Nyquist</i> where the aid was available only to students attending nonpublic schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bafc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court concluded that allowing the tax credits did not entail government entanglement with religion. No government monitoring was involved in the program; the government was not required by the law to oversee any aspect of the parochial schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bafc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Marshall dissented and was joined by Justices Brennan, Blackmun, and Stevens. Justice Marshall contended that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from subsidizing parochial schools, even if it is providing the same assistance to public schools students. Justice Marshall said, “The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits a State from subsidizing religious education, whether it does so directly or indirectly. In my view, this principle of neutrality forbids not only the tax benefits struck down in Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, but any tax benefit, including the tax deduction at issue here, which subsidizes tuition payments to sectarian schools.”</p>
<p id="fc6bafc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court appeared to resolve this tension in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, where the Court, by a five-to-four margin, upheld a voucher program through which aid could be used for parochial schools.</p>

<p id="fc6bafce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fc6bafcf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District. The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. We hold that it does not.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District. The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families. Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school. For more than a generation, however, Cleveland’s public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation. In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a “crisis of magnitude” and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control. Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Cleveland’s public schools <span title="1804" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1804">p. 1804</span>were in the midst of a “crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.” The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance. Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools. More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation. Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate. Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program. The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been “under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.” Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district. First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parent’s choosing. Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district. Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards. Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to “advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.” Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program. Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student. All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need. Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250. For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250. For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap. These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate. Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child. If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.</p>
<p id="fc6bafd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school. Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment. Students <span title="1805" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1805">p. 1805</span>from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360. All other students receive 75% of that amount. The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 1996-1997 school year. In the 1999-2000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation. None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate. More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line. In the 1998-1999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid. This number was expected to double during the 1999-2000 school year.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Cleveland’s schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover. That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools. Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts. These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum. They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery. During the 1999-2000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled. For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students. For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school. As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prevents a State from enacting laws that have the “purpose” or “effect” of advancing or inhibiting religion. There is no dispute that the program challenged here was enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system. Thus, the question presented is whether the Ohio program nonetheless has the forbidden “effect” of advancing or inhibiting religion.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To answer that question, our decisions have drawn a consistent distinction between government programs that provide aid directly to religious schools, Mitchell v. Helms (2000), and programs of true private choice, in which government aid reaches religious schools only as a result of the genuine and independent choices of private individuals, Mueller v. Allen (1983); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind (1986); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist. (1993). While our jurisprudence with respect to the constitutionality of direct aid programs has “changed significantly” over the past two decades, our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained <span title="1806" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1806">p. 1806</span>consistent and unbroken. Three times we have confronted Establishment Clause challenges to neutral government programs that provide aid directly to a broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct the aid to religious schools or institutions of their own choosing. Three times we have rejected such challenges.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mueller</i>, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the program’s beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools. We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included “all parents,” including parents with “children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools,” the program was “not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.” Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools “only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.” This, we said, ensured that “‘no imprimatur of state approval’ can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.” We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying: “We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.” That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Witters</i>, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor. Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that “[a]ny aid . . . that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.” We further remarked that, as in <i>Mueller</i>, “[the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.” In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from <i>Mueller</i> that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry. Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, in <i>Zobrest</i>, we applied <i>Mueller</i> and <i>Witters</i> to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools. Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.” Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole, we observed that the program “distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled.’” Its “primary beneficiaries,” we said, were “disabled children, not sectarian schools.” We further observed that “[b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute <span title="1807" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1807">p. 1807</span>ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.” Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools. Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mueller</i>, <i>Witters</i>, and <i>Zobrest</i> thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause. A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits. As a plurality of this Court recently observed: “[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.” Mitchell v. Helms (2000).</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that the program challenged here is a program of true private choice, consistent with <i>Mueller</i>, <i>Witters</i>, and <i>Zobrest</i>, and thus constitutional. As was true in those cases, the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion. It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district. It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion, i.e., any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School District. The program permits the participation of all schools within the district, religious or nonreligious. Adjacent public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so. Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion. The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are no “financial incentive[s]” that “ske[w]” the program toward religious schools. Such incentives “[are] not present . . . where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.” The program here in fact creates financial disincentives for religious schools, with private schools receiving only half the government assistance given to community schools and one-third the assistance given to magnet schools. Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school. Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools. Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the school’s tuition. Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing. <span title="1808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1808">p. 1808</span>Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program “creates . . . financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.”</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a “public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.” But we have repeatedly recognized that no reasonable observer would think a neutral program of private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals, carries with it the imprimatur of government endorsement. The argument is particularly misplaced here since “the reasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware” of the “history and context” underlying a challenged program.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children. Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause. The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating all options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Souter speculates that because more private religious schools currently participate in the program, the program itself must somehow discourage the participation of private nonreligious schools. But Cleveland’s preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities. Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious. It is true that 82% of Cleveland’s participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools. To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater. Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less that 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents and Justice Souter claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools. They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if one parent has ever said so. We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in <i>Mueller</i>, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at <span title="1809" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1809">p. 1809</span>religious schools. Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools. The constitutionality of a neutral educational aid program simply does not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time, most private schools are run by religious organizations, or most recipients choose to use the aid at a religious school. As we said in <i>Mueller</i>, “[s]uch an approach would scarcely provide the certainty that this field stands in need of, nor can we perceive principled standards by which such statistical evidence might be evaluated.”</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This point is aptly illustrated here. The 96% figure upon which respondents and Justice Souter rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance. Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 1999-2000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%. The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year. In the 1997-1998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion. It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district. It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious. The program is therefore a program of true private choice. In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is little question in my mind that the Cleveland voucher program is neutral as between religious schools and nonreligious schools. Justice Souter rejects the Court’s notion of neutrality, proposing that the neutrality of a program should be gauged not by the opportunities it presents but rather by its effects. But Justice Souter’s notion of neutrality is inconsistent with that in our case law. As we put it in <i>Agostini</i>, government aid must be “made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.”</p>
<p id="fc6bd6f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program. For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect. They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents. The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program. The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all. Moreover, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6fa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I find the Court’s answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious <span title="1810" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1810">p. 1810</span>schools persuasive.

<p id="fc6bd6fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frederick Douglass once said that “[e]ducation . . . means emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth, the light by which men can only be made free.” Today many of our inner-city public schools deny emancipation to urban minority students. Despite this Court’s observation nearly 50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education, that “it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education,” urban children have been forced into a system that continually fails them. These cases present an example of such failures. Besieged by escalating financial problems and declining academic achievement, the Cleveland City School District was in the midst of an academic emergency when Ohio enacted its scholarship program.</p>
<p id="fc6bd6ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissents and respondents wish to invoke the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated through the Fourteenth, to constrain a State’s neutral efforts to provide greater educational opportunity for underprivileged minority students. Today’s decision properly upholds the program as constitutional, and I join it in full.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the textual and historical merits of incorporating the Establishment Clause, I can accept that the Fourteenth Amendment protects religious liberty rights. But I cannot accept its use to oppose neutral programs of school choice through the incorporation of the Establishment Clause. There would be a tragic irony in converting the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of individual liberty into a prohibition on the exercise of educational choice.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The wisdom of allowing States greater latitude in dealing with matters of religion and education can be easily appreciated in this context. Respondents advocate using the Fourteenth Amendment to handcuff the State’s ability to experiment with education. But without education one can hardly exercise the civic, political, and personal freedoms conferred by the Fourteenth Amendment. Faced with a severe educational crisis, the State of Ohio enacted wide-ranging educational reform that allows voluntary participation of private and religious schools in educating poor urban children otherwise condemned to failing public schools. The program does not force any individual to submit to religious indoctrination or education. It simply gives parents a greater choice as to where and in what manner to educate their children. This is a choice that those with greater means have routinely exercised.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to expanding the reach of the scholarship program, the inclusion of religious schools makes sense given Ohio’s purpose of increasing educational performance and opportunities. Religious schools, like other private schools, achieve far better educational results than their public counterparts. <span title="1811" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1811">p. 1811</span>For example, the students at Cleveland’s Catholic schools score significantly higher on Ohio proficiency tests than students at Cleveland public schools. Of Cleveland eighth graders taking the 1999 Ohio proficiency test, 95 percent in Catholic schools passed the reading test, whereas only 57 percent in public schools passed. And 75 percent of Catholic school students passed the math proficiency test, compared to only 22 percent of public school students. But the success of religious and private schools is in the end beside the point, because the State has a constitutional right to experiment with a variety of different programs to promote educational opportunity. That Ohio’s program includes successful schools simply indicates that such reform can in fact provide improved education to underprivileged urban children.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although one of the purposes of public schools was to promote democracy and a more egalitarian culture, failing urban public schools disproportionately affect minority children most in need of educational opportunity. At the time of Reconstruction, blacks considered public education “a matter of personal liberation and a necessary function of a free society.” Today, however, the promise of public school education has failed poor inner-city blacks. While in theory providing education to everyone, the quality of public schools varies significantly across districts. Just as blacks supported public education during Reconstruction, many blacks and other minorities now support school choice programs because they provide the greatest educational opportunities for their children in struggling communities. Opponents of the program raise formalistic concerns about the Establishment Clause but ignore the core purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN118FC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N118FC_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">59</a></span></p>
<p id="fc6bfe15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the romanticized ideal of universal public education resonates with the cognoscenti who oppose vouchers, poor urban families just want the best education for their children, who will certainly need it to function in our high-tech and advanced society. As Thomas Sowell noted 30 years ago: “Most black people have faced too many grim, concrete problems to be romantics. They want and need certain tangible results, which can be achieved only by developing certain specific abilities.” The same is true today. An individual’s life prospects increase dramatically with each successfully completed phase of education. For instance, a black high school dropout earns just over $13,500, but with a high school degree the average income is almost $21,000. Blacks with a bachelor’s degree have an average annual income of about $37,500, and $75,500 with a professional degree. Staying in school and earning a degree generates real and tangible financial benefits, whereas failure to obtain even a high school degree essentially relegates students to a life of poverty and, all too often, of crime. The failure to provide education to poor urban children perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, dependence, criminality, and alienation that continues for the remainder of their lives. If society cannot end racial discrimination, at least it <span title="1812" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1812">p. 1812</span>can arm minorities with the education to defend themselves from some of discrimination’s effects.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ten States have enacted some form of publicly funded private school choice as one means of raising the quality of education provided to underprivileged urban children. These programs address the root of the problem with failing urban public schools that disproportionately affect minority students. Converting the Fourteenth Amendment from a guarantee of opportunity to an obstacle against education reform distorts our constitutional values and disserves those in the greatest need. As Frederick Douglass poignantly noted “no greater benefit can be bestowed upon a long benighted people, than giving to them, as we are here earnestly this day endeavoring to do, the means of an education.”</p>

<p id="fc6bfe18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s majority holds that the Establishment Clause is no bar to Ohio’s payment of tuition at private religious elementary and middle schools under a scheme that systematically provides tax money to support the schools’ religious missions. The occasion for the legislation thus upheld is the condition of public education in the city of Cleveland. The record indicates that the schools are failing to serve their objective, and the vouchers in issue here are said to be needed to provide adequate alternatives to them. If there were an excuse for giving short shrift to the Establishment Clause, it would probably apply here. But there is no excuse. Constitutional limitations are placed on government to preserve constitutional values in hard cases, like these.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, however, the majority holds that the Establishment Clause is not offended by Ohio’s Pilot Project Scholarship Program, under which students may be eligible to receive as much as $2,250 in the form of tuition vouchers transferable to religious schools. In the city of Cleveland the overwhelming proportion of large appropriations for voucher money must be spent on religious schools if it is to be spent at all, and will be spent in amounts that cover almost all of tuition. The money will thus pay for eligible students’ instruction not only in secular subjects but in religion as well, in schools that can fairly be characterized as founded to teach religious doctrine and to imbue teaching in all subjects with a religious dimension. Public tax money will pay at a systemic level for teaching the covenant with Israel and Mosaic law in Jewish schools, the primacy of the Apostle Peter and the Papacy in Catholic schools, the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools, and the revelation to the Prophet in Muslim schools, to speak only of major religious groupings in the Republic.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fc6bfe1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fc6bfe1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider first the criterion of neutrality. As recently as two Terms ago, a majority of the Court recognized that neutrality conceived of as evenhandedness <span title="1813" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1813">p. 1813</span>toward aid recipients had never been treated as alone sufficient to satisfy the Establishment Clause. Today, however, the majority employs the neutrality criterion in a way that renders it impossible to understand.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to apply the neutrality test, then, it makes sense to focus on a category of aid that may be directed to religious as well as secular schools, and ask whether the scheme favors a religious direction. Here, one would ask whether the voucher provisions, allowing for as much as $2,250 toward private school tuition (or a grant to a public school in an adjacent district), were written in a way that skewed the scheme toward benefiting religious schools. This, however, is not what the majority asks. The majority looks not to the provisions for tuition vouchers, but to every provision for educational opportunity.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The illogic is patent. If regular, public schools (which can get no voucher payments) “participate” in a voucher scheme with schools that can, and public expenditure is still predominantly on public schools, then the majority’s reasoning would find neutrality in a scheme of vouchers available for private tuition in districts with no secular private schools at all. “Neutrality” as the majority employs the term is, literally, verbal and nothing more. This, indeed, is the only way the majority can gloss over the very nonneutral feature of the total scheme covering “all schools”: public tutors may receive from the State no more than $324 per child to support extra tutoring (that is, the State’s 90% of a total amount of $360), whereas the tuition voucher schools (which turn out to be mostly religious) can receive up to $2,250.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why the majority does not simply accept the fact that the challenge here is to the more generous voucher scheme and judge its neutrality in relation to religious use of voucher money seems very odd. It seems odd, that is, until one recognizes that comparable schools for applying the criterion of neutrality are also the comparable schools for applying the other majority criterion, whether the immediate recipients of voucher aid have a genuinely free choice of religious and secular schools to receive the voucher money. And in applying this second criterion, the consideration of “all schools” is ostensibly helpful to the majority position.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fc6bfe22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority addresses the issue of choice the same way it addresses neutrality, by asking whether recipients or potential recipients of voucher aid have a choice of public schools among secular alternatives to religious schools. Again, however, the majority asks the wrong question and misapplies the criterion. The majority has confused choice in spending scholarships with choice from the entire menu of possible educational placements, most of them open to anyone willing to attend a public school. I say “confused” because the majority’s new use of the choice criterion, which it frames negatively as “whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools,” ignores the reason for having a private choice enquiry in the first place. Cases since <i>Mueller</i> have found private choice relevant under a rule that aid to religious schools can be permissible so long as it first passes through the hands of students or parents. The majority’s view that all educational choices are comparable for purposes of choice thus ignores the whole point of the choice test: it is a criterion for deciding whether indirect aid to a religious school is legitimate because it passes through private hands that can spend or use the aid in a secular school. The question is whether the private hand is genuinely free to send the money in either a <span title="1814" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1814">p. 1814</span>secular direction or a religious one. The majority now has transformed this question about private choice in channeling aid into a question about selecting from examples of state spending (on education) including direct spending on magnet and community public schools that goes through no private hands and could never reach a religious school under any circumstance. When the choice test is transformed from where to spend the money to where to go to school, it is cut loose from its very purpose.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, contrary to the majority, we ask the right question about genuine choice to use the vouchers, the answer shows that something is influencing choices in a way that aims the money in a religious direction: of 56 private schools in the district participating in the voucher program (only 53 of which accepted voucher students in 1999-2000); 46 of them are religious; 96.6% of all voucher recipients go to religious schools, only 3.4% to nonreligious ones. Unfortunately for the majority position, there is no explanation for this that suggests the religious direction results simply from free choices by parents. One answer to these statistics, for example, which would be consistent with the genuine choice claimed to be operating, might be that 96.6% of families choosing to avail themselves of vouchers choose to educate their children in schools of their own religion. This would not, in my view, render the scheme constitutional, but it would speak to the majority’s choice criterion. Evidence shows, however, that almost two out of three families using vouchers to send their children to religious schools did not embrace the religion of those schools. The families made it clear they had not chosen the schools because they wished their children to be proselytized in a religion not their own, or in any religion, but because of educational opportunity.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even so, the fact that some 2,270 students chose to apply their vouchers to schools of other religions, might be consistent with true choice if the students “chose” their religious schools over a wide array of private nonreligious options, or if it could be shown generally that Ohio’s program had no effect on educational choices and thus no impermissible effect of advancing religious education. But both possibilities are contrary to fact. First, even if all existing nonreligious private schools in Cleveland were willing to accept large numbers of voucher students, only a few more than the 129 currently enrolled in such schools would be able to attend, as the total enrollment at all nonreligious private schools in Cleveland for kindergarten through eighth grade is only 510 children, and there is no indication that these schools have many open seats. Second, the $2,500 cap that the program places on tuition for participating low-income pupils has the effect of curtailing the participation of nonreligious schools: “nonreligious schools with higher tuition (about $4,000) stated that they could afford to accommodate just a few voucher students.” By comparison, the average tuition at participating Catholic schools in Cleveland in 1999-2000 was $1,592, almost $1,000 below the cap.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, in any case, no way to interpret the 96.6% of current voucher money going to religious schools as reflecting a free and genuine choice by the families that apply for vouchers. The 96.6% reflects, instead, the fact that too few nonreligious school desks are available and few but religious schools can afford to accept more than a handful of voucher students. And contrary to the majority’s assertion, public schools in adjacent districts hardly have a financial incentive to participate in the Ohio voucher program, and none has. For the overwhelming number of children in the voucher scheme, the only alternative <span title="1815" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1815">p. 1815</span>to the public schools is religious. And it is entirely irrelevant that the State did not deliberately design the network of private schools for the sake of channeling money into religious institutions. The criterion is one of genuinely free choice on the part of the private individuals who choose, and a Hobson’s choice is not a choice, whatever the reason for being Hobsonian.</p>

<p id="fc6bfe27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not dissent merely because the majority has misapplied its own law, for even if I assumed arguendo that the majority’s formal criteria were satisfied on the facts, today’s conclusion would be profoundly at odds with the Constitution. Proof of this is clear on two levels.</p>
<p id="fc6bfe28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The scale of the aid to religious schools approved today is unprecedented, both in the number of dollars and in the proportion of systemic school expenditure supported. As we said in <i>Meek</i>, “it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role” as the object of aid that comes in “substantial amounts.”</p>
<p id="fc6bfe29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is virtually superfluous to point out that every objective underlying the prohibition of religious establishment is betrayed by this scheme, but something has to be said about the enormity of the violation. I anticipated these objectives earlier, the first being respect for freedom of conscience. Jefferson described it as the idea that no one “shall be compelled to . . . support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever,” even a “teacher of his own religious persuasion,” and Madison thought it violated by any “‘authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence . . . of his property for the support of any . . . establishment.’” Memorial and Remonstrance ¶3. “Any tax to establish religion is antithetical to the command that the minds of men always be wholly free.” Madison’s objection to three pence has simply been lost in the majority’s formalism.</p>
<p id="fc6c253a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the second objective, to save religion from its own corruption, Madison wrote of the “‘experience . . . that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation.’” Memorial and Remonstrance ¶7. In Madison’s time, the manifestations were “pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity[,] in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution”; in the 21st century, the risk is one of “corrosive secularism” to religious schools, and the specific threat is to the primacy of the schools’ mission to educate the children of the faithful according to the unaltered precepts of their faith. Even “[t]he favored religion may be compromised as political figures reshape the religion’s beliefs for their own purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings government regulation.” The risk is already being realized. In Ohio, for example, a condition of receiving government money under the program is that participating religious schools may not “discriminate on the basis of . . . religion,” which means the school may not give admission preferences to children who are members of the patron faith; children of a parish are generally consigned to the same admission lotteries as non-believers. For perspective on this foot-in-the-door of religious regulation, it is well to remember that the money had barely begun to flow.</p>
<p id="fc6c253b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the divisiveness permitted by today’s majority is to be avoided in the short term, it will be avoided only by action of the political branches at the state and national levels. Legislatures not driven to desperation by the problems of public <span title="1816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1816">p. 1816</span>education may be able to see the threat in vouchers negotiable in sectarian schools. Perhaps even cities with problems like Cleveland’s will perceive the danger, now that they know a federal court will not save them from it.</p>
<p id="fc6c253c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My own course as judge on the Court cannot, however, simply be to hope that the political branches will save us from the consequences of the majority’s decision. <i>Everson</i>’s statement is still the touchstone of sound law, even though the reality is that in the matter of educational aid the Establishment Clause has largely been read away. True, the majority has not approved vouchers for religious schools alone, or aid earmarked for religious instruction. But no scheme so clumsy will ever get before us, and in the cases that we may see, like these, the Establishment Clause is largely silenced. I do not have the option to leave it silent, and I hope that a future Court will reconsider today’s dramatic departure from basic Establishment Clause principle.</p>

I do so because I believe that the Establishment Clause concern for protecting the Nation’s social fabric from religious conflict poses an overriding obstacle to the implementation of this well-intentioned school voucher program. And by explaining the nature of the concern, I hope to demonstrate why, in my view, “parental choice” cannot significantly alleviate the constitutional problem.</p>
<p id="fc6c253f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to government aid to private education, did not history show that efforts to obtain equivalent funding for the private education of children whose parents did not hold popular religious beliefs only exacerbated religious strife? As Justice Rutledge recognized: “Public money devoted to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest for more. It brings too the struggle of sect against sect for the larger share or for any. Here one [religious sect] by numbers [of adherents] alone will benefit most, there another. This is precisely the history of societies which have had an established religion and dissident groups.” Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947) (dissenting opinion).</p>
<p id="fc6c2540-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is the development of constitutional doctrine that reads the Establishment Clause as avoiding religious strife, not by providing every religion with an equal opportunity (say, to secure state funding or to pray in the public schools), but by drawing fairly clear lines of separation between church and state—at least where the heartland of religious belief, such as primary religious education, is at issue.</p>
<p id="fc6c2541-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle underlying these cases—avoiding religiously based social conflict—remains of great concern. As religiously diverse as America had become when the Court decided its major 20th century Establishment Clause cases, we are exponentially more diverse today. America boasts more than 55 different religious groups and subgroups with a significant number of members.</p>
<p id="fc6c2542-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under these modern-day circumstances, how is the “equal opportunity” principle to work—without risking the “struggle of sect against sect” against which Justice Rutledge warned? School voucher programs finance the religious education of the young. And, if widely adopted, they may well provide billions of dollars that will do so. Why will different religions not become concerned about, and seek to influence, the criteria used to channel this money to religious schools? Why will they not want to examine the implementation of the <span title="1817" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1817">p. 1817</span>programs that provide this money—to determine, for example, whether implementation has biased a program toward or against particular sects, or whether recipient religious schools are adequately fulfilling a program’s criteria? If so, just how is the State to resolve the resulting controversies without provoking legitimate fears of the kinds of religious controversies without provoking legitimate fears of the kinds of religious favoritism that, in so religiously diverse a Nation, threaten social dissension?</p>
<p id="fc6c2543-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the voucher program here at issue. That program insists that the religious school accept students of all religions. Does that criterion treat fairly groups whose religion forbids them to do so? The program also insists that no participating school “advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.” And it requires the State to “revoke the registration of any school if, after a hearing, the superintendent determines that the school is in violation” of the program’s rules. As one amicus argues, “it is difficult to imagine a more divisive activity” than the appointment of state officials as referees to determine whether a particular religious doctrine “teaches hatred or advocates lawlessness.”</p>
<p id="fc6c2544-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How are state officials to adjudicate claims that one religion or another is advocating, for example, civil disobedience in response to unjust laws, the use of illegal drugs in a religious ceremony, or resort to force to call attention to what it views as an immoral social practice? What kind of public hearing will there be in response to claims that one religion or another is continuing to teach a view of history that casts members of other religions in the worst possible light? How will the public react to government funding for schools that take controversial religious positions on topics that are of current popular interest—say, the conflict in the Middle East or the war on terrorism? Yet any major funding program for primary religious education will require criteria. And the selection of those criteria, as well as their application, inevitably pose problems that are divisive. Efforts to respond to these problems not only will seriously entangle church and state, but also will promote division among religious groups, as one group or another fears (often legitimately) that it will receive unfair treatment at the hands of the government.</p>
<p id="fc6c2545-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I recognize that other nations, for example Great Britain and France, have in the past reconciled religious school funding and religious freedom without creating serious strife. Yet British and French societies are religiously more homogeneous—and it bears noting that recent waves of immigration have begun to create problems of social division there as well. See, e.g., the Muslims of France, 75 Foreign Affairs 78 (1996) (describing increased religious strife in France, as exemplified by expulsion of teenage girls from school for wearing traditional Muslim scarves); Ahmed, Extreme Prejudice; Muslims in Britain, The Times of London, May 2, 1992, p. 10 (describing religious strife in connection with increased Muslim immigration in Great Britain).</p>
<p id="fc6c2546-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a society as religiously diverse as ours, the Court has recognized that we must rely on the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment to protect against religious strife, particularly when what is at issue is an area as central to religious belief as the shaping, through primary education, of the next generation’s minds and spirits.</p>
<p id="fc6c2547-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in effect, turns the clock back. It adopts, under the name of “neutrality,” an interpretation of the Establishment Clause that this Court rejected more than half a century ago. In its view, the parental choice that offers each <span title="1818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1818">p. 1818</span>religious group a kind of equal opportunity to secure government funding overcomes the Establishment Clause concern for social concord. An earlier Court found that “equal opportunity” principle insufficient; it read the Clause as insisting upon greater separation of church and state, at least in respect to primary education. In a society composed of many different religious creeds, I fear that this present departure from the Court’s earlier understanding risks creating a form of religiously based conflict potentially harmful to the Nation’s social fabric. Because I believe the Establishment Clause was written in part to avoid this kind of conflict, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fc6c254a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tax exemptions that benefit only religion are unconstitutional, but those that benefit other groups along with religion, such as charitable and educational institutions, are permissible. In Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664 (1970), the Court upheld a state law that provided property tax exemptions for real or personal property used exclusively for religious, educational, or charitable purposes. The plaintiffs argued that the Establishment Clause was violated by the tax exemption for religious property that was used solely for religious worship. The Supreme Court disagreed and emphasized that the government “granted exemption to all houses of religious worship within a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations which include hospitals, libraries, playgrounds, scientific, professional, historical, and patriotic groups.”</p>
<p id="fc6c254b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that “[t]he legislative purpose of a property tax exemption is neither the advancement nor the inhibition of religion; it is neither sponsorship nor hostility.” Rather, the goal is to help nonprofit institutions that the government regards as important to the community. The Court also concluded that granting the tax exemption did not entail excessive government involvement with religion. In fact, the Court said that “[e]limination of exemption would tend to expand the involvement of government by giving rise to tax valuation of church property, tax liens, tax foreclosures, and the direct confrontations and conflicts that follow in the train of those legal processes.”</p>
<p id="fc6c254c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court declared unconstitutional a tax exemption that was available only for religious organizations. A Texas law provided an exemption from the state sales and use tax for periodicals that were published or distributed by a religious faith and that consisted solely of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith and for books that consisted wholly of writings sacred to a religions faith. The plurality opinion by Justice Brennan, and joined by Justices Marshall and Stevens, emphasized that <i>Walz</i> was distinguishable because there “the benefits derived by religious organizations flowed to a large number of nonreligious groups as well.” Justice Brennan explained, “Insofar as that subsidy is conferred upon a wide array of nonsectarian groups as well as religious organizations . . . , the fact that religious groups benefit incidentally does not deprive the subsidy of the secular purpose and primary effect mandated by the Establishment Clause. However, when government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause . . . , it provide[s] unjustifiable awards of assistance to religious organizations and cannot but ‘convey a message of endorsement’ to slighted members of the community.”</p>
<p id="fc6c254d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1819" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1819">p. 1819</span>Justice Scalia dissented and was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy. Scalia objected in strong language claiming that “[a]s a judicial demolition project today’s decision is impressive,” and that the “decision introduces a new strain of irrationality in our Religion Clause jurisprudence.” Scalia lamented that laws, like Texas’s, that existed in 15 states were declared unconstitutional. For the dissent, the tax exemption for religious publications was a permissible accommodation of religion and did not have the purpose or effect of advancing religion or entail excessive government entanglement with religion.</p>
<p id="fc6c254e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, <i>Walz</i> and <i>Texas Monthly</i> together indicate that states may give tax exemptions to religious groups only if nonreligious charitable organizations also are beneficiaries. A tax exemption solely for religious groups violates the Establishment Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119F5_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N119F5_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">60</a></span></p>

<p id="fc6c4c62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has been more lenient in allowing government assistance to religious colleges and universities. The Court has distinguished colleges and universities on the grounds that they are not likely to be as permeated with religious doctrine and dogma as are elementary and secondary schools. Also, the Court has emphasized the difference in the age of the students and their ability to understand that government assistance is not endorsement of religion. Additionally, the Court has stressed that aid to colleges and universities is much less likely to produce the political divisiveness that seems inherent to assistance to parochial elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p id="fc6c4c63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), the Court upheld the constitutionality of religious colleges and universities receiving federal money for the construction of facilities that would not be used for religious instruction. <i>Tilton</i> concerned Title I of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which provided construction grants for buildings and facilities used exclusively for secular purposes. The Court applied the <i>Lemon</i> test and concluded that it was permissible for religious schools to receive the assistance. The Court concluded that the purpose of the aid was to expand facilities in colleges and universities to “accommodate rapidly growing numbers of youth who aspire to a higher education.” The Court said that this is a “legitimate secular objective entirely appropriate for governmental action.”</p>
<p id="fc6c4c64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the Court found that the aid did not have the effect of advancing religion because the law “was carefully drafted to ensure that the federally subsidized facilities would be devoted to the secular and not the religious function of the recipient institutions. It authorizes grants and loans only for academic facilities that will be used for defined secular purposes and expressly prohibits their use for religious instruction, training or worship.” The Court, however, invalidated a part of the act that allowed the facilities to be used for religious purposes after 20 years. The Court said that allowing the building to be converted to religious use at that time would impermissibly have the “effect of advancing religion.”</p>
<p id="fc6c4c65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1820" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1820">p. 1820</span>Finally, the Court concluded that allowing the aid would not cause excessive government entanglement with religion. The Court said that “[t]here are generally significant differences between the religious aspects of church-related institutions of higher learning and parochial elementary and secondary schools. . . . [C]ollege students are less impressionable and less susceptible to religious indoctrination. . . . Since religious indoctrination is not a substantial purpose or activity of these church-related colleges and universities, there is less likelihood than in primary and secondary schools that religion will permeate the area of secular education.”</p>
<p id="fc6c4c66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Douglas, Black, Marshall, and Brennan dissented. They argued that direct government financial aid to religious institutions, including at the college and university level, violates the Establishment Clause. Justice Douglas said that “even a small amount coming out of the pocket of taxpayers and going into the coffers of a church was not in keeping with our constitutional ideal.”</p>
<p id="fc6c4c67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973), the Court followed the same reasoning as in <i>Tilton</i> and allowed the use of state revenue bonds for religious colleges and universities. A state’s Educational Facilities Authority issued bonds to finance the construction of facilities in colleges and universities in the state. Beneficiaries included religious schools, but they were not allowed to use the funds for the construction of facilities to be used for religious activities and the bonds had to be repaid by the schools. The Court relied on <i>Tilton</i> to uphold the aid, again emphasizing that the use of the funds was restricted, that the money was available to secular and religious schools, and that the institution was not permeated with religious instruction in the same way as an elementary or secondary school.</p>
<p id="fc6c4c68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736 (1976), the distinction between colleges and universities as compared to elementary and secondary schools was even clearer as the Court upheld a program of direct state financial aid to religious colleges and universities. Maryland created a program whereby it provided for grants to private colleges and universities for students and universities. The aid was calculated at 15 percent of the amount per student that the state spent in the public college system. Religious schools, except for seminaries, were allowed to receive the aid. The Court, by a five-to-four margin, but without a majority opinion, upheld the program.</p>
<p id="fc6c4c69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Blackmun’s plurality opinion invoked <i>Tilton</i> and <i>Hunt</i> and found that the requirements of the <i>Lemon</i> test were met. Justice Blackmun said that the “purpose of Maryland’s aid program is the secular one of supporting private higher education generally, as an economic alternative to a wholly public system.” Moreover, he said that the “institutions are not so permeated by religion that the secular side cannot be separated from the sectarian.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A41_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A41_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">61</a></span> Therefore, the effect was not to advance religion because the state law required that “state funds not be used to support specifically religious activity.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A49_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11A49_ef812bb2-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">62</a></span> Finally, the plurality opinion concluded that there was not excessive entanglement because there was minimal state oversight required and because “the danger of political divisiveness is substantially less when the aided institution is not an elementary or secondary school, but a college, whose student constituency is not local but diverse and widely dispersed.” Justices White and Rehnquist concurred in the <span title="1821" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1821">p. 1821</span>judgment and criticized the <i>Lemon</i> test but agreed that this aid was not motivated by a religious purpose and did not have a primary effect of advancing religion.</p>

<p id="fc6c737e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relatively few cases have involved attempts by the government to give assistance to religious institutions other than schools. The decisions thus far indicate that the Court is more likely to be deferential to the government—as in reviewing aid to colleges and universities—than it is to be more vigilant in its review—as it is concerning aid to elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p id="fc6c737f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291 (1899), the Court upheld the constitutionality of the government building a new facility for a church-affiliated hospital. The Court allowed the government aid to a hospital operated by members of the Roman Catholic Church under the auspices of the Church. The Court noted that the hospital did not discriminate based on religion and said that it was “wholly immaterial” that a religious group ran the hospital.</p>
<p id="fc6c7380-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 549 (1988), the Court deemed constitutional the Adolescent Family Life Act, which provided for grants to organizations to provide counseling and care to pregnant adolescents and their parents, and also to provide counseling to prevent adolescent sexual activity. The law specifically authorized receipt of grants by religious, as well as nonreligious, organizations. The law prohibited the use of any federal funds for family planning services, for abortion counseling, or for abortions.</p>
<p id="fc6c7381-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority in the five-to-four decision and applied the <i>Lemon</i> test to uphold the law. Rehnquist said that the law “was motivated primarily, if not entirely, by a legitimate secular purpose—the elimination or reduction of social and economic problems caused by teenage sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood.”</p>
<p id="fc6c7382-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also said that the law did not have an impermissible effect of advancing religion, even though it specifically encouraged organizations to allow religious groups to play a role. The Court concluded that the law did not favor or disfavor religious groups compared to secular ones and thus was permissible. Rehnquist stressed that the statute was successful in its “maintenance of a course of neutrality among religions and between religion and nonreligion.” The Court said that it was “important that the aid is made available regardless of whether it will ultimately flow to a secular or sectarian institution.” In fact, the Court invoked Bradfield v. Roberts as establishing the proposition that “religious institutions are [not] disabled by the First Amendment from participating in publicly sponsored social welfare programs.”</p>
<p id="fc6c7383-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court said that there was not excessive entanglement with religion. Although the law did not require monitoring by the government, the Court said that most of the cases that had applied the entanglement test had involved elementary and secondary schools that “were pervasively sectarian and had as a substantial purpose the inculcation of religious values.” The Court said that “[h]ere, by contrast, there is no reason to assume that the religious organizations which may receive grants are pervasively sectarian in the same sense as the Court has held parochial schools to be.”</p>
<p id="fc6c7384-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1822" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1822">p. 1822</span>Justice Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens. B1ackmun focused on the act’s subsidizing religious teaching. He said that the “statute encouraged the use of public funds for such instruction, by giving religious groups a central pedagogical and counseling role without imposing any restraints on the sectarian quality of the participation.” Blackmun particularly objected to the Court’s claim that the groups were not pervasively sectarian; he questioned both the relevance of this factor and the characterization of the particular groups that would receive funds. Blackmun argued that the law clearly had the effect of advancing religion: “Government funds are paying for religious organizations to teach and counsel impressionable adolescents on a highly sensitive subject of considerable religious significance, often on the premises of a church or parochial school and without any effort to remove religious symbols from the sites.”</p>
<p id="fc6c7385-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bowen</i> is a relatively narrow decision. What types of aid the government can provide to religious institutions and under what circumstance remain to be resolved.</p>

The third purpose of separation and neutrality is to prevent the trivialization and degradation of religion by too close an attachment to the organs of government. . . . Finally, the principles of separation and neutrality help assure that essentially religious issues, precisely because of their importance and sensitivity, not become the occasion for battle in the political arena.</p></div><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fc668030-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">Marsh v.

Moe, Schools, Special Vouchers, and the American Public 164 (2001). Nearly three-fourths of all public school parents with an annual income less than $20,000 support vouchers, compared to 57 percent of public school parents with an annual income of over $60,000. In addition, 75 percent of black public school parents support vouchers, as do 71 percent of Hispanic public school parents.
