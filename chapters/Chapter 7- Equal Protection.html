<p id="fbe6a167-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution as originally drafted and ratified had no provisions assuring equal protection of the laws. This, of course, is not surprising for a document written for a society where blacks were enslaved and where women were routinely discriminated against. After the Civil War, widespread discrimination against former slaves led to the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides in part, “No state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fbe6a168-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The promise of this provision went unrealized for almost a century as the Supreme Court rarely found any state or local action to violate the Equal Protection Clause until the mid-1950s. Indeed, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes derisively referred to the provision as “the last resort of constitutional arguments.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10035_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10035_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> Holmes probably was referring to the possibility of challenging almost any law as discriminating against someone and to the Court’s consistent reluctance to use the Equal Protection Clause to invalidate state or local laws.</p>
<p id="fbe6a16a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), ushered in the modern era of equal protection jurisprudence. Since <i>Brown</i>, the Supreme Court has relied on the Equal Protection Clause as a key provision for combatting invidious discrimination and for safeguarding fundamental rights.</p>
<p id="fbe6a16b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There remains no provision in the Constitution that says that the federal government cannot deny equal protection of the laws. However, in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education that concerned the segregation of the District of Columbia public schools, the Court held that equal protection applies to the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbe6a16c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obviously, it would be unacceptable to allow the federal government to discriminate based on race or gender in a manner prohibited the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. To avoid this embarrassment, the Court interpreted the Fifth Amendment as including an implicit requirement for equal protection. The Court simply declared that “discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.”</p>
<p id="fbe6a16d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-684">p. 684</span>It is now well settled that the requirements of equal protection are the same whether the challenge is to the federal government under the Fifth Amendment or to state and local actions under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has expressly declared that “[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> But technically, equal protection applies to the federal government through judicial interpretation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and to state and local governments through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<div id="fbe6c87f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbe6c880-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">2.&nbsp;A Framework for Equal Protection Analysis</p></h3></div>

<p id="fbe6c881-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All equal protection cases pose the same basic question: Is the government’s classification justified by a sufficient purpose? Many government laws draw a distinction among people and thus are potentially susceptible to an equal protection challenge. For example, those under age 16 might claim to be discriminated against by the age requirement for obtaining a driver’s license, and those denied government benefits might argue that they are discriminated against by eligibility guidelines. If these laws, or any government actions, are challenged based on equal protection, the issue is whether the government can identify a sufficiently important objective for its discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbe6c882-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What constitutes a sufficient justification depends entirely on the type of discrimination. For instance, the Supreme Court has declared that it is extremely suspicious of race discrimination, and therefore the government may use racial classifications only if it proves that they are necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. This is known as “strict scrutiny.” In contrast, a 14-year-old who claimed that the denial of a driver’s license violated equal protection would prevail only by proving that the law was not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. This is known as “rational basis” review.</p>
<p id="fbe6c883-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be more specific, all equal protection issues can be broken down into three questions: What is the classification? What level of scrutiny should be applied? Does the particular government action meet the level of scrutiny?</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-nepq" id="fbe6c884-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">
<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbe6c885-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>QUESTION 1: WHAT IS THE CLASSIFICATION?</i></p></h3></div>

<p id="fbe6c886-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question is what is the government’s classification? How is the government drawing a distinction among people? Equal protection analysis always must begin by identifying how the government is distinguishing among people. Sometimes this is clear; sometimes it is the focus of the litigation.</p>
<p id="fbe6c887-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As described below, there are two basic ways of establishing a classification. One is where the classification exists on the face of the law—that is, where the law in its very terms draws a distinction among people based on a particular characteristic. For example, a law that prohibits blacks from serving on juries is <span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-685">p. 685</span>an obvious facial racial classification.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10081_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10081_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> Likewise, a law that says that only those 16 and older can have drivers’ licenses is obviously a facial classification.</p>
<p id="fbe6c889-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, sometimes laws are facially neutral, but there is a discriminatory impact to the law or discriminatory effects from its administration. For instance, a law that requires that all police officers be at least 5′10&amp;#x2033; tall and 150 pounds is, on its face, only a height and weight classification. Statistics, however, show that over 40 percent of men but only 2 percent of women will meet this requirement. The result is that the law has a discriminatory impact against women in hiring for the police force.</p>
<p id="fbe6c88a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As described below, the Supreme Court has made it clear that discriminatory impact is insufficient to prove a racial or gender classification. If a law is facially neutral, demonstrating a race or gender classification requires proof that there is a discriminatory purpose behind the law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10091_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10091_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> Thus, women challenging the height and weight requirements for the police force must show that the government’s purpose was to discriminate based on gender.</p>
<p id="fbe6c88c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, there are two alternative ways of proving the existence of a classification: showing that it exists on the face of the law or demonstrating that a facially neutral law has a discriminatory impact and a discriminatory purpose.</p>

<p id="fbe6ef9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the classification is identified, the next step in analysis is to identify the level of scrutiny to be applied. The Supreme Court has made it clear that differing levels of scrutiny will be applied depending on the type of discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbe6efa0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discrimination based on race or national origin is subjected to strict scrutiny. Also, generally, discrimination against aliens is subjected to strict scrutiny, although there are several exceptions where less than strict scrutiny is used. Under strict scrutiny, a law is upheld if it is proven necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. The government must have a truly significant reason for discriminating, and it must show that it cannot achieve its objective through any less discriminatory alternative. The government has the burden of proof under strict scrutiny and the law will be upheld only if the government persuades the court that it is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose.

<p id="fbe6efa5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, there is the rational basis test. Rational basis review is the minimum level of scrutiny that all laws challenged under equal protection must meet.

<p id="fbe716b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How has the Court decided which level of scrutiny to use for particular classifications? Although the Court has shown little willingness in the past two decades to subject additional classifications to strict or intermediate scrutiny, how will it evaluate such requests? Several criteria are applied in determining the level of scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbe716ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the Court has emphasized that immutable characteristics—like race, national origin, gender, and the marital status of one’s parents—warrant heightened scrutiny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100FB_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100FB_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span> The notion is that it is unfair to penalize a person for characteristics that the person did not choose and that the individual cannot change.</p>
<p id="fbe716bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also considers the ability of the group to protect itself through the political process. Women, for example, are more than half the population, but traditionally have been severely underrepresented in political offices. Aliens do not have the ability to vote and thus the political process cannot be trusted to represent their interests.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1010A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span></p>
<p id="fbe716be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of discrimination against the group also is relevant to the Court in determining the level of scrutiny. A related issue is the Court’s judgment concerning the likelihood that the classification reflects prejudice as opposed to a permissible government purpose.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10118_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10118_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span> For example, the Court’s choice of strict scrutiny for racial classifications reflects its judgment that race is virtually never an acceptable justification for government action. In contrast, the Court’s use of intermediate scrutiny for gender classifications reflects its view that the <span title="687" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-687">p. 687</span>biological differences between men and women mean that there are more likely to be instances where sex is a justifiable basis for discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbe716c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the levels of scrutiny are firmly established in constitutional law and especially in equal protection analysis, there are many who criticize the rigid tiers of review. For example, Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens, among others, have argued that there should be a sliding scale of review rather than the three levels of scrutiny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10126_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10126_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span> They maintain that the Court should consider such factors as the constitutional and social importance of the interests adversely affected and the invidiousness of the basis on which the classification was drawn. They contend that under the rigid tiers of review the choice of the level of scrutiny is usually decisive and unduly limits the scope of judicial analysis. Those who favor a sliding scale believe that it would lead to more candid discussion of the competing interests and therefore provide overall better decision making.</p>
<p id="fbe716c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some critics suggest that although the Court speaks in terms of three tiers of review, in reality there is a spectrum of standards of review.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10135_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10135_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> The claim is that in some cases where the Court says that it is using rational basis review, it is actually employing a test with more “bite” than the customarily deferential rational basis review. Similarly, it is argued that in some cases intermediate scrutiny is applied in a very deferential manner that is essentially rational basis review, while in other cases intermediate scrutiny seems indistinguishable from strict scrutiny. The argument is that although the Court articulates three tiers of review, the reality is a range of standards. In reading the cases below, it is useful to consider whether the Court’s definitions and applications of the levels of scrutiny have been consistent, or whether the Court has varied in this regard to achieve the results it desires.</p>

<p id="fbe716c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The level of scrutiny is the rule of law that is applied to the particular government action being challenged as denying equal protection. In evaluating the constitutionality of a law, the Court evaluates both the law’s ends and its means. For strict scrutiny, the end must be deemed compelling for the law to be upheld; for intermediate scrutiny, the end has to be regarded as important; and for the rational basis test, there just has to be a legitimate purpose.</p>
<p id="fbe716c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In evaluating the relationship of the means of the particular law to the end, the Supreme Court often focuses on the degree to which a law is underinclusive and/or overinclusive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10156_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10156_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span> A law is underinclusive if it does not apply to individuals who are similar to those to whom the law applies. For example, a law that excludes those under age 16 from having drivers’ licenses is somewhat <span title="688" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-688">p. 688</span>overinclusive because some younger drivers undoubtedly have the physical ability and the emotional maturity to be effective drivers.</p>
<p id="fbe73dd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A law is overinclusive if it applies to those who need not be included in order for the government to achieve its purpose. In other words, the law unnecessarily applies to a group of people. For example, the government’s decision to evacuate and intern all Japanese Americans on the West Coast during World War II was radically overinclusive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10165_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10165_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span> Although the government’s purported interest was in preventing espionage, individuals were evacuated and interned without any determination of their threat. Obviously, the law was enormously overinclusive because it harmed a large number of people unnecessarily.</p>
<p id="fbe73ddb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A law can be both underinclusive and overinclusive. The decision to evacuate Japanese Americans during World War II was certainly both. If the goal was to isolate those who were a threat to security, interning only Japanese Americans was underinclusive in that it did not identify those of other races who posed a danger. At the same time, as explained above, the federal government’s action was extremely overinclusive because few, if any, Japanese Americans posed any threat. In fact, not a single Japanese American during World War II was ever charged with espionage.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10171_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10171_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">17</a></span></p>
<p id="fbe73ddd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that a law is underinclusive and/or overinclusive does not mean that it is sure to be invalidated. Quite the contrary, virtually all laws are underinclusive, overinclusive, or both. The Court has recognized that laws often are underinclusive because the government may choose to proceed “one step at a time.” But underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness are used by courts in evaluating the fit between the government’s means and its ends. If strict scrutiny is used, a relatively close fit is required; in fact, the government will have to show that the means are necessary—the least restrictive alternative—to achieve the goal. Under intermediate scrutiny, a closer fit will be required and less underinclusiveness or overinclusiveness will be permitted than under the rational basis test.</p>
<p id="fbe73dde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, equal protection analysis involves three questions: What is the classification?

<p id="fbe73de2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Usually equal protection is used to analyze government actions that draw a distinction among people based on specific characteristics, such as race, gender, age, disability, or other traits. Sometimes, though, equal protection is used if the government discriminates among people as to the exercise of a fundamental right.</p>
<p id="fbe73de3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="689" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-689">p. 689</span>An early case using equal protection in this way was Skinner v.

Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101A5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101A5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> The Oklahoma Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act required surgical sterilization for individuals who had been convicted three or more times for crimes involving “moral turpitude.” The Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional as violating equal protection because it discriminated among people in their ability to exercise a fundamental liberty: the right to procreate. Justice William Douglas, writing for the Court, said, “We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, far-reaching and devastating effects.” In other words, the Court found that the right to procreate was a fundamental right and essentially used strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause to analyze the government’s discrimination. The Court has used the Equal Protection Clause to protect other fundamental rights such as voting,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101AD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101AD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">20</a></span> access to the judicial process,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101B8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101B8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">21</a></span> and interstate travel.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101C3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101C3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> The use of equal protection to safeguard these fundamental rights was, in part, based on the Supreme Court’s desire to avoid substantive due process, which had all of the negative connotations of the <i>Lochner</i> era. However, the effect is the same whether a right is deemed fundamental under the Equal Protection Clause or under the Due Process Clause: Government infringements are subjected to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbe764f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 8 discusses fundamental rights, including both those that the Court has protected under the Equal Protection Clause and those safeguarded under due process. For example, the cases on marriage equality for gays and lesbians, which have focused on both equal protection and due process, are presented in the next chapter. This chapter focuses on the use of equal protection to analyze discrimination among people based on traits such as race, gender, alienage, legitimacy, age, disability, wealth, and sexual orientation.</p>

In other words, unless the government action is a type of discrimination that warrants the application of intermediate or strict scrutiny, rational basis review is used. Although the Court has phrased the test in different ways over time,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101EF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101EF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> the basic requirement is that a law <span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>meets rational basis review if it is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. For instance, in New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297 (1976), and in many other cases, the Court said that the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied as long as the classification is “rationally related to a legitimate state interest.” Also, the Court has been consistent that the challenger has the burden of proof when rational basis review is applied. There is a strong presumption in favor of laws that are challenged under the rational basis test.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101FC_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101FC_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span></p>
<p id="fbe78c10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court generally has been extremely deferential to the government when applying the rational basis test. As discussed below, the Court often has said that a law should be upheld if it is possible to conceive any legitimate purpose for the law, even if it was not the government’s actual purpose. The result is that it is rare for the Supreme Court to find that a law fails the rational basis test.</p>
<p id="fbe78c11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This raises important questions. First, is this appropriate deference to the legislative process or undue judicial abdication? Since 1937, the Court has made it clear that it will defer to government economic and social regulations unless they infringe on a fundamental right or discriminate against a group that warrants special judicial protection.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1020B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1020B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span> This can be defended as proper judicial restraint, as the Court allows the more democratic branches of government to make decisions except in areas where there is reason for heightened judicial scrutiny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10217_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10217_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> Legislation often involves arbitrary choices favoring some over others, and judicial deference leaves these decisions to the political process.</p>
<p id="fbe78c14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But it also can be argued that the Court has gone too far in its deference under the rational basis test. Unfair laws are allowed to stand because a conceivable legitimate purpose can be identified for virtually any law. Frequently these are laws enacted to help a particular group with political clout at the expense of others who are less politically powerful.</p>
<p id="fbe78c15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another underlying issue in considering the rational basis test is whether the Court has been consistent in applying it. Although in general the Court has been enormously deferential, there have been several cases where laws have been declared unconstitutional under rational basis review. For example, in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985), the Court used rational basis review to invalidate a zoning ordinance that prevented the operation of a home for the mentally disabled. In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), the Court found that a voter initiative in Colorado that repealed laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and that precluded the adoption of new protections failed rational basis review.</p>
<p id="fbe78c16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many argue that the Court in these cases applied a different, more rigorous version of the rational basis test—one with “bite.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10229_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10229_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span> The claim is that there is not a singular rational basis test but one that varies between complete deference and <span title="691" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-691">p. 691</span>substantial rigor. On the other hand, it might be argued that the test is consistent and that the Court is simply deciding that certain laws lack a legitimate purpose or are so arbitrary as to be unreasonable. In considering the cases below, it is important to assess whether there is a singular rational basis test or differences in the test applied by the Court depending on the results it wants to achieve.</p>
<p id="fbe78c18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In examining a law under rational basis review, there are two questions: Does the law have a legitimate purpose? Is the law rationally related to achieving it? Each of these issues is discussed in turn.</p>

<p id="fbe7b32b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing whether there is a legitimate purpose for a law, there are two interrelated questions.

<p id="fbe7b32e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the least, the government has a legitimate purpose if it advances a traditional “police” purpose: protecting safety, public health, or public morals. Public safety, public health, and public morals are legitimate government purposes, but they are not the only ones. Virtually any goal that is not forbidden by the Constitution will be deemed sufficient to meet the rational basis test. As the Supreme Court declared in Berman v. Parker, “Public safety, public health, morality, peace and quiet, law and order—these are some of the more conspicuous examples of the traditional application of the police power to municipal affairs. Yet they merely illustrate the scope of the power and do not delimit it.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1025B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1025B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span> For example, in New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance that banned all pushcart food vendors in the French Quarter, except those who had continuously operated there for eight or more years. The Court accepted the city’s claim that “street peddlers and hawkers tend to interfere with the charm and beauty of a historic area and disturb tourists and disrupt their enjoyment of that charm and beauty, and that such vendors . . . might thus have a deleterious effect on the economy of the city.” The Court said that the distinction among vendors based on their length of work in the French Quarter was legitimate because “[t]he city could reasonably decide that newer businesses were less likely to have built up substantial reliance interests in continued operation.”</p>

<p id="fbe7da49-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enactment challenged in this case is an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Colorado, adopted in a 1992 statewide referendum. The parties and the state courts refer to it as “Amendment 2,” its designation when submitted to the voters. The impetus for the amendment and the contentious campaign that preceded its adoption came in large part from ordinances that had been passed in various Colorado municipalities. For example, the cities of Aspen and Boulder and the city and County of Denver each had enacted ordinances which banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in many transactions and activities, including housing, employment, education, public accommodations, and health and welfare services.</p>
<p id="fbe7da4a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet Amendment 2, in explicit terms, does more than repeal or rescind these provisions. It prohibits all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the named class, a class we shall refer to as homosexual persons or gays and lesbians. The amendment reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbe7da4b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian or Bisexual Orientation. Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This Section of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing.</p>

<p id="fbe7da4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s principal argument in defense of Amendment 2 is that it puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all other persons. So, the State says, the measure does no more than deny homosexuals special rights. This reading of the amendment’s language is implausible. We rely not upon our own interpretation of the amendment but upon the authoritative construction of Colorado’s Supreme Court. The critical discussion of the amendment is as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbe7da4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The immediate objective of Amendment 2 is, at a minimum, to repeal existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities that barred discrimination based on sexual orientation. . . . The “ultimate effect” of Amendment 2 is to prohibit any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective statutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future unless the state constitution is first amended to permit such measures.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbe7da4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sweeping and comprehensive is the change in legal status effected by this law. Homosexuals, by state decree, are put in a solitary class with respect to <span title="693" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-693">p. 693</span>transactions and relations in both the private and governmental spheres. The amendment withdraws from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal protection from the injuries caused by discrimination, and it forbids reinstatement of these laws and policies.</p>
<p id="fbe80160-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The change Amendment 2 works in the legal status of gays and lesbians in the private sphere is far reaching, both on its own terms and when considered in light of the structure and operation of modern anti-discrimination laws. Amendment 2 bars homosexuals from securing protection against the injuries that public-accommodations laws address. That in itself is a severe consequence, but there is more. Amendment 2, in addition, nullifies specific legal protections for this targeted class in all transactions in housing, sale of real estate, insurance, health and welfare services, private education, and employment. Not confined to the private sphere, Amendment 2 also operates to repeal and forbid all laws or policies providing specific protection for gays or lesbians from discrimination by every level of Colorado government.</p>
<p id="fbe80161-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he amendment imposes a special disability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint. They can obtain specific protection against discrimination only by enlisting the citizenry of Colorado to amend the State Constitution or perhaps, on the State’s view, by trying to pass helpful laws of general applicability. This is so no matter how local or discrete the harm, no matter how public and widespread the injury. We find nothing special in the protections Amendment 2 withholds. These are protections taken for granted by most people either because they already have them or do not need them; these are protections against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a free society.</p>

<p id="fbe80163-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment’s promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons. We have attempted to reconcile the principle with the reality by stating that, if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.</p>
<p id="fbe80164-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry. First, the amendment has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group, an exceptional and, as we shall explain, invalid form of legislation. Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.</p>
<p id="fbe80165-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taking the first point, even in the ordinary equal protection case calling for the most deferential of standards, we insist on knowing the relation between the classification adopted and the object to be attained. The search for the link between classification and objective gives substance to the Equal Protection Clause; it provides guidance and discipline for the legislature, which is entitled to know what sorts of laws it can pass; and it marks the limits of our own <span title="694" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-694">p. 694</span>authority. In the ordinary case, a law will be sustained if it can be said to advance a legitimate government interest, even if the law seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for it seems tenuous. See New Orleans v. Dukes (1976) (tourism benefits justified classification favoring pushcart vendors of certain longevity). Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc. (1955) (assumed health concerns justified law favoring optometrists over opticians). The laws challenged in the cases just cited were narrow enough in scope and grounded in a sufficient factual context for us to ascertain some relation between the classification and the purpose it served. By requiring that the classification bear a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end, we ensure that classifications are not drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.</p>
<p id="fbe80166-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Amendment 2 confounds this normal process of judicial review. It is at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence.</p>
<p id="fbe80167-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort. Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance. Respect for this principle explains why laws singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardships are rare. A law declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government is itself a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.</p>
<p id="fbe80168-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second and related point is that laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected. “[I]f the constitutional conception of ‘equal protection of the laws’ means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.” Department of Agriculture v. Moreno (1973).</p>
<p id="fbe80169-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Amendment 2, however, in making a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, inflicts on them immediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate justifications that may be claimed for it. We conclude that, in addition to the far-reaching deficiencies of Amendment 2 that we have noted, the principles it offends, in another sense, are conventional and venerable; a law must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, and Amendment 2 does not.</p>
<p id="fbe8016a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary rationale the State offers for Amendment 2 is respect for other citizens’ freedom of association, and in particular the liberties of landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality. Colorado also cites its interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups. The breadth of the amendment is so far removed from these particular justifications that we find it impossible to credit them. We cannot say that Amendment 2 is directed to any identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It is a status-based enactment divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests; it is a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit. “[C]lass legislation . . . [is] obnoxious to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .” <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>.</p>
<p id="fbe8287b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="695" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-695">p. 695</span>We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbe8287d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit of spite. The constitutional amendment before us here is not the manifestation of a “‘bare . . . desire to harm’” homosexuals, but is rather a modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful minority to revise those mores through use of the laws. That objective, and the means chosen to achieve it, are not only unimpeachable under any constitutional doctrine hitherto pronounced (hence the opinion’s heavy reliance upon principles of righteousness rather than judicial holdings); they have been specifically approved by the Congress of the United States and by this Court.</p>
<p id="fbe8287e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding that homosexuality cannot be singled out for disfavorable treatment, the Court contradicts a decision, unchallenged here, pronounced only 10 years ago, see Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), and places the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias. Whether it is or not is precisely the cultural debate that gave rise to the Colorado constitutional amendment (and to the preferential laws against which the amendment was directed). Since the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this subject, it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means, including the democratic adoption of provisions in state constitutions. This Court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the Members of this institution are selected, pronouncing that “animosity” toward homosexuality, is evil. I vigorously dissent.</p>
<p id="fbe8287f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only denial of equal treatment it contends homosexuals have suffered is this: They may not obtain preferential treatment without amending the State Constitution. That is to say, the principle underlying the Court’s opinion is that one who is accorded equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal protection of the laws. If merely stating this alleged “equal protection” violation does not suffice to refute it, our constitutional jurisprudence has achieved terminal silliness.</p>
<p id="fbe82880-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central thesis of the Court’s reasoning is that any group is denied equal protection when, to obtain advantage (or, presumably, to avoid disadvantage), it must have recourse to a more general and hence more difficult level of political decisionmaking than others. The world has never heard of such a principle, which is why the Court’s opinion is so long on emotive utterance and so short on relevant legal citation. And it seems to me most unlikely that any multilevel democracy can function under such a principle. For <i>whenever</i> a disadvantage is imposed, or conferral of a benefit is prohibited, at one of the higher levels of democratic decisionmaking (i.e., by the state legislature rather than local government, or by the people at large in the state constitution rather than the legislature), the affected group has (under this theory) been denied equal protection.</p>
<p id="fbe82881-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="696" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-696">p. 696</span>I turn next to whether there was a legitimate rational basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment—for the prohibition of special protection for homosexuals. It is unsurprising that the Court avoids discussion of this question, since the answer is so obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue before us today is not even mentioned in the Court’s opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), we held that the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all States had done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years—making homosexual conduct a crime. That holding is unassailable, except by those who think that the Constitution changes to suit current fashions. If it is constitutionally permissible for a State to make homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for a State to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct. And a fortiori it is constitutionally permissible for a State to adopt a provision not even disfavoring homosexual conduct, but merely prohibiting all levels of state government from bestowing special protections upon homosexual conduct.</p>
<p id="fbe82882-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will.</p>

Ct. 2584 (2015), the Court struck down, respectively, a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and laws in four states prohibiting same-sex marriage. In both cases the Court found that the laws violated equal protection because of their discrimination based on sexual orientation. In neither case did the Court indicate the level of scrutiny it was using. Both cases are presented in Chapter 8 in connection with the discussion of the right to marry.</p>

<p id="fbe82886-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s enormous judicial deference under the rational basis test is, in part, because of its willingness to accept any conceivable legitimate purpose as sufficient, even if it was not the government’s actual purpose. In other words, a law will be upheld as long as the government’s lawyer can identify some conceivable legitimate purpose, regardless of whether that was the government’s actual motivation. The Court has declared that under rational basis review the actual purpose behind a law is irrelevant and the law must be upheld “if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify” its discrimination.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10336_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10336_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span></p>
<p id="fbe84f98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A key issue is whether any conceivable legitimate purpose should be sufficient or whether the courts should insist on a legitimate actual purpose. The <span title="697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-697">p. 697</span>Supreme Court has clearly held that under rational basis review the former, any conceivable legitimate purpose, is sufficient. An example of this is in U.S. Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166 (1980), in which the Supreme Court upheld a federal law designed to prevent retired railroad workers from receiving benefits under both the Social Security system and the railroad retirement system. The law allowed those who were already retired and receiving dual benefits to continue to get them, but those who were still employed could not get dual benefits unless they had worked for the railroads for 25 years. The result was that a person who had worked 10 years for the railroads and was already retired could get dual benefits, but a person who had worked for 24 years and was still employed could not collect dual benefits.</p>
<p id="fbe84f99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In upholding the law, the Court said, “Where, as here, there are plausible reasons for Congress’s action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlies the legislative decision because this Court never has insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute. This is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily engage in a process of line drawing.” The Court accepted the government’s claim that the Congress could have believed that those who had acquired a statutory entitlement to dual benefits while still employed in the railroad industry “had a greater equitable claim to those benefits than [those] who were no longer in railroad employment when they became eligible for dual benefits.”</p>
<p id="fbe84f9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, in Federal Communications Commission v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307 (1993), the Court reaffirmed that any conceivable legislative purpose is sufficient and even went so far as to say that “those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negate every conceivable basis which might support it.” The case involved a challenge to a provision of the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 that created an exemption to certain regulations for cable television facilities that serve one or more buildings under common ownership or operation. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the Court, said, “[B]ecause we never require a legislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. . . . [A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.” Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion, lamented that “[j]udicial review under the ‘conceivable set of facts’ test is tantamount to no review at all.”</p>
<p id="fbe84f9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This issue—whether any conceivable legitimate purpose is sufficient or whether it must be the actual purpose—is crucial in determining the impact of rational basis review. If any conceivable purpose is sufficient, very few laws will fail the rational basis test. Government lawyers can invent some legitimate conceivable purpose for virtually every law. The critics argue that rational basis review is meaningful only if the Court limits itself to looking at the actual purpose for a law.</p>
<p id="fbe84f9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, those who defend the Supreme Court point out that rarely is there a single, identifiable purpose for a law. Legislators might have radically different reasons for supporting a specific legislative act. Justice Rehnquist once remarked that actual purpose review “assumes that individual legislators are motivated by one discernable actual purpose, and ignores the fact that different legislators may vote for a single piece of legislation for widely different <span title="698" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-698">p. 698</span>reasons.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10353_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10353_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span> Moreover, once a law is struck down for lack of an adequate actual purpose, Congress simply could reenact the law and assert a permissible goal.</p>
<p id="fbe84f9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, the issue is over how much “bite” there should be in the rational basis test. Allowing any conceivable legitimate purpose to suffice makes the rational basis test a rule of almost complete deference to the government. Limiting the judiciary to considering only the actual purpose behind a law would dramatically increase the chance that laws would be struck down under rational basis review.</p>

<p id="fbe876b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As described above, laws are underinclusive when they do not regulate all who are similarly situated. Underinclusive laws raise the concern that the government has enacted a law that targets a particular politically powerless group or that exempts those with more political clout. But the Supreme Court has said that when rational basis review is used, even substantial underinclusiveness is allowed, because the government “may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1038E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1038E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">34</a></span> The following decision is a classic case used to illustrate the Court’s willingness to tolerate underinclusiveness under rational basis review.

<p id="fbe876be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbe876bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 124 of the Traffic Regulations of the City of New York promulgated by the Police Commissioner provides: “No person shall operate, or cause to be <span title="699" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-699">p. 699</span>operated, in or upon any street an advertising vehicle; provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the putting of business notices upon business delivery vehicles, so long as such vehicles are engaged in the usual business or regular work of the owner and not used merely or mainly for advertising.”</p>
<p id="fbe876c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant is engaged in a nation-wide express business. It operates about 1,900 trucks in New York City and sells the space on the exterior sides of these trucks for advertising. That advertising is for the most part unconnected with its own business. It was convicted in the magistrates court and fined.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question of equal protection of the laws is pressed strenuously on us. It is pointed out that the regulation draws the line between advertisements of products sold by the owner of the truck and general advertisements. It is argued that unequal treatment on the basis of such a distinction is not justified by the aim and purpose of the regulation. It is said, for example, that one of appellant’s trucks carrying the advertisement of a commercial house would not cause any greater distraction of pedestrians and vehicle drivers than if the commercial house carried the same advertisement on its own truck. Yet the regulation allows the latter to do what the former is forbidden from doing. It is therefore contended that the classification which the regulation makes has no relation to the traffic problem since a violation turns not on what kind of advertisements are carried on trucks but on whose trucks they are carried.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That, however, is a superficial way of analyzing the problem, even if we assume that it is premised on the correct construction of the regulation. The local authorities may well have concluded that those who advertised their own wares on their trucks do not present the same traffic problem in view of the nature or extent of the advertising which they use. It would take a degree of omniscience which we lack to say that such is not the case. If that judgment is correct, the advertising displays that are exempt have less incidence on traffic than those of appellants.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot say that that judgment is not an allowable one. Yet if it is, the classification has relation to the purpose for which it is made and does not contain the kind of discrimination against which the Equal Protection Clause affords protection. It is by such practical considerations based on experience rather than by theoretical inconsistencies that the question of equal protection is to be answered. And the fact that New York City sees fit to eliminate from traffic this kind of distraction but does not touch what may be even greater ones in a different category, such as the vivid displays on Times Square, is immaterial. It is no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Jackson</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment which this Court may invoke to invalidate ordinances by which municipal governments seek to solve their local problems. One says that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The other declares that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fbe89dd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My philosophy as to the relative readiness with which we should resort to these two clauses is almost diametrically opposed to the philosophy which prevails on this Court. While claims of denial of equal protection are frequently asserted, they are rarely sustained. But the Court frequently uses the Due Process Clause to strike down measures taken by municipalities to deal with activities in their <span title="700" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-700">p. 700</span>streets and public places which the local authorities consider to create hazards, annoyances or discomforts to their inhabitants.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The burden should rest heavily upon one who would persuade us to use the Due Process Clause to strike down a substantive law or ordinance. Even its provident use against municipal regulations frequently disables all government— state, municipal and federal—from dealing with the conduct in question because the requirement of due process is also applicable to State and Federal Governments. Invalidation of a statute or an ordinance on due process grounds leaves ungoverned and ungovernable conduct which many people find objectionable.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Invocation of the Equal Protection Clause, on the other hand, does not disable any governmental body from dealing with the subject at hand. It merely means that the prohibition or regulation must have a broader impact. I regard it as a salutary doctrine that cities, states and the Federal Government must exercise their powers so as not to discriminate between their inhabitants except upon some reasonable differentiation fairly related to the object of regulation. This equality is not merely abstract justice. The framers of the Constitution knew, and we should not forget today, that there is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally. Conversely, nothing opens the door to arbitrary action so effectively as to allow those officials to pick and choose only a few to whom they will apply legislation and thus to escape the political retribution that might be visited upon them if larger numbers were affected. Courts can take no better measure to assure that laws will be just than to require that laws be equal in operation.</p>
<p id="fbe89dd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case affords an illustration. Even casual observations from the sidewalks of New York will show that an ordinance which would forbid all advertising on vehicles would run into conflict with many interests, including some, if not all, of the great metropolitan newspapers, which use that advertising extensively. Their blandishment of the latest sensations is not less a cause of diverted attention and traffic hazard than the commonplace cigarette advertisement which this truck-owner is forbidden to display. But any regulation applicable to all such advertising would require much clearer justification in local conditions to enable its enactment than does some regulation applicable to a few. I do not mention this to criticize the motives of those who enacted this ordinance, but it dramatizes the point that we are much more likely to find arbitrariness in the regulation of the few than of the many. Hence, for my part, I am more receptive to attack on local ordinances for denial of equal protection than for denial of due process, while the Court has more often used the latter clause.</p>
<p id="fbe89dda-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged with considerable force that this local regulation does not comply with the Equal Protection Clause because it applies unequally upon classes whose differentiation is in no way relevant to the objects of the regulation. As a matter of principle and in view of my attitude toward the Equal Protection Clause, I do not think differences of treatment under law should be approved on classification because of differences unrelated to the legislative purpose. The Equal Protection Clause ceases to assure either equality or protection if it is avoided by any conceivable difference that can be pointed out between those bound and those left free.</p>

<p id="fbe89ddd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, even substantial overinclusiveness is tolerated under rational basis review. A law is overinclusive if it regulates individuals who are not similarly situated; that is, if it covers more people than it needs to in order to accomplish its purpose. Overinclusive laws are unfair to those who are unnecessarily regulated and they risk “burden[ing] a politically powerless group which would have been spared if it had enough clout to compel normal attention to the relevant costs and benefits.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10403_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10403_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span></p>
<p id="fbe89ddf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has indicated that even significant overinclusiveness is allowed under rational basis review. New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer is an important illustration in this regard. It also indicates that laws that are both significantly underinclusive and overinclusive often are upheld under rational basis review.</p>

<p id="fbe8c3f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About 40,000 persons receive methadone maintenance treatment in New York City, of whom about 26,000 participate in the five major public or semipublic programs, and 14,000 are involved in about 25 private programs. The sole purpose of all these programs is to treat the addiction of persons who have been using heroin for at least two years.</p>
<p id="fbe8c3f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence indicates that methadone is an effective cure for the physical aspects of heroin addiction. The crucial indicator of successful methadone maintenance is the patient’s abstinence from the illegal or excessive use of drugs and alcohol. The District Court found that the risk of reversion to drug or alcohol abuse declines dramatically after the first few months of treatment. Indeed, “the strong majority” of patients who have been on methadone maintenance for at least a year are free from illicit drug use. But a significant number are not. On this critical point, the evidence relied upon by the District Court reveals that even among participants with more than 12 months’ tenure in methadone maintenance programs, the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse may often approach and even exceed 25%.</p>

<p id="fbe8c3fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the Transit Authority’s rule places a meaningful restriction on all of its employees and job applicants; in that sense the rule is one of general applicability and satisfies the equal protection principle without further inquiry. The District Court, however, interpreted the rule as applicable to the limited class of persons who regularly use narcotic drugs, including methadone. As so interpreted, we are necessarily confronted with the question whether the rule reflects an impermissible bias against a special class.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents have never questioned the validity of a special rule for all users of narcotics. Rather, they originally contended that persons receiving methadone should not be covered by that rule; in other words, they should not be included within a class that is otherwise unobjectionable. Their constitutional claim was that methadone users are entitled to be treated like most other employees and applicants rather than like other users of narcotics. But the District Court’s findings unequivocally establish that there are relevant differences between persons using methadone regularly and persons who use no narcotics of any kind.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, a substantial percentage of persons taking methadone will not successfully complete the treatment program. The findings do not indicate with any precision the number who drop out, or the number who can fairly be classified as unemployable, but the evidence indicates that it may well be a majority of those taking methadone at any given time.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents no longer question the need, or at least the justification, for special rules for methadone users. Indeed, they vigorously defend the District Court’s opinion which expressly held that it would be permissible for the Transit Authority [“TA”] to have a special rule denying methadone users any employment unless they had been undergoing treatment for at least a year, and another special rule denying even the most senior and reliable methadone users any of the more dangerous jobs in the system.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But any special rule short of total exclusion that TA might adopt is likely to be less precise—and will assuredly be more costly—than the one that it currently enforces. If eligibility is marked at any intermediate point—whether after one year of treatment or later—the classification will inevitably discriminate between employees or applicants equally or almost equally apt to achieve full recovery. Even the District Court’s opinion did not rigidly specify one year as a constitutionally mandated measure of the period of treatment that guarantees full recovery from drug addiction. The uncertainties associated with the rehabilitation of heroin addicts precluded it from identifying any bright line marking the point at which the risk of regression ends. By contrast, the “no drugs” policy now enforced by TA is supported by the legitimate inference that as long as a treatment program (or other drug use) continues, a degree of uncertainty persists. Accordingly, an employment policy that postpones eligibility until the treatment program has been completed, rather than accepting an intermediate point on an uncertain line, is rational. It is neither unprincipled nor invidious in the sense that it implies disrespect for the excluded subclass.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent is therefore repeatedly mistaken in attributing to the District Court a finding that TA’s “normal screening process without additional effort” would suffice in the absence of the “no drugs” rule. Aggravating this erroneous factual assumption is a mistaken legal proposition advanced by the dissent— that TA can be faulted for failing to prove the unemployability of “successfully <span title="703" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-703">p. 703</span>maintained methadone users.” Aside from the misallocation of the burden of proof that underlies this argument, it is important to note that TA did prove that 20% to 30% of the class afforded relief by the District Court are not “successfully maintained,” and hence are assuredly not employable. Even assuming therefore that the percentage of employable persons in the remaining 70% is the same as that in the class of TA applicants who do not use methadone, it is respondents who must be faulted for failing to prove that the offending 30% could be excluded as cheaply and effectively in the absence of the rule.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At its simplest, the District Court’s conclusion was that TA’s rule is broader than necessary to exclude those methadone users who are not actually qualified to work for TA. We may assume not only that this conclusion is correct but also that it is probably unwise for a large employer like TA to rely on a general rule instead of individualized consideration of every job applicant. But these assumptions concern matters of personnel policy that do not implicate the principle safeguarded by the Equal Protection Clause. As the District Court recognized, the special classification created by TA’s rule serves the general objectives of safety and efficiency. Moreover, the exclusionary line challenged by respondents “is not one which is directed ‘against’ any individual or category of persons, but rather it represents a policy choice . . . made by that branch of Government vested with the power to make such choices.”</p>
<p id="fbe8eb13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because it does not circumscribe a class of persons characterized by some unpopular trait or affiliation, it does not create or reflect any special likelihood of bias on the part of the ruling majority. Under these circumstances, it is of no constitutional significance that the degree of rationality is not as great with respect to certain ill-defined subparts of the classification as it is with respect to the classification as a whole.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No matter how unwise it may be for TA to refuse employment to individual car cleaners, track repairmen, or bus drivers simply because they are receiving methadone treatment, the Constitution does not authorize a federal court to interfere in that policy decision.</p>

<p id="fbe8eb16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that the evidence conclusively established that petitioners exclude from employment all persons who are successfully on methadone maintenance—that is, those who after one year are “free of the use of heroin, other illicit drugs, and problem drinking,” those who have graduated from methadone programs and remain drug free for less than five years; that past or present successful methadone maintenance is not a meaningful predictor of poor performance or conduct in most job categories; that petitioners could use their normal employee-screening mechanisms to separate the successfully maintained users from the unsuccessful; and that petitioners do exactly that for other groups that common sense indicates might also be suspect employees. Petitioners did not challenge these factual conclusions in the Court of Appeals, but that court nonetheless reviewed the evidence and found that it overwhelmingly supported the District Court’s findings.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb17-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears repeating, then, that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that those who have been maintained on methadone for at least a year and who are free from the use of illicit drugs and alcohol can easily be identified through normal personnel procedures and, for a great many jobs, are as employable as and present no more risk than applicants from the general population.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="704" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-704">p. 704</span>The question before us is the rationality of placing successfully maintained or recently cured persons in the same category as those just attempting to escape heroin addiction or who have failed to escape it, rather than in with the general population. The asserted justification for the challenged classification is the objective of a capable and reliable work force, and thus the characteristic in question is employability. “Employability,” in this regard, does not mean that any particular applicant, much less every member of a given group of applicants, will turn out to be a model worker. Nor does it mean that no such applicant will ever become or be discovered to be a malingerer, thief, alcoholic, or even heroin addict. All employers take such risks. Employability, as the District Court used it in reference to successfully maintained methadone users, means only that the employer is no more likely to find a member of that group to be an unsatisfactory employee than he would an employee chosen from the general population.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners had every opportunity, but presented nothing to negative the employability of successfully maintained methadone users as distinguished from those who were unsuccessful. Instead, petitioners, like the Court, dwell on the methadone failures—those who quit the programs or who remain but turn to illicit drug use. The Court, for instance, makes much of the drug use of many of those in methadone programs, including those who have been in such programs for more than one year. But this has little force since those persons are not “successful,” can be and have been identified as such, and, despite the Court’s efforts to put them there, are not within the protection of the District Court’s injunction. That 20% to 30% are unsuccessful after one year in a methadone program tells us nothing about the employability of the successful group, and it is the latter category of applicants that the District Court and the Court of Appeals held to be unconstitutionally burdened by the blanket rule disqualifying them from employment.</p>
<p id="fbe8eb1a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even were the District Court wrong, and even were successfully maintained persons marginally less employable than the average applicant, the blanket exclusion of only these people, when but a few are actually unemployable and when many other groups have varying numbers of unemployable members, is arbitrary and unconstitutional. Many persons now suffer from or may again suffer from some handicap related to employability. But petitioners have singled out respondents—unlike ex-offenders, former alcoholics and mental patients, diabetics, epileptics, and those currently using tranquilizers, for example—for sacrifice to this at best ethereal and likely nonexistent risk of increased unemployability. Such an arbitrary assignment of burdens among classes that are similarly situated with respect to the proffered objectives is the type of invidious choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbe91234-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case requires us to consider the constitutionality of §3(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, which, with certain exceptions, excludes from participation in the food stamp program any household containing an individual who is unrelated to any other member of the household. In practical effect, §3(e) creates two classes of persons for food stamp purposes: one class is composed of those individuals who live in households all of whose members are related to one another, and the other class consists of those individuals who live in households containing one or more members who are unrelated to the rest. The latter class of persons is denied federal food assistance.</p>

<p id="fbe91236-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal food stamp program was established in 1964 in an effort to alleviate hunger and malnutrition among the more needy segments of our society. Eligibility for participation in the program is determined on a household rather than an individual basis. An eligible household purchases sufficient food stamps to provide that household with a nutritionally adequate diet. The household pays for the stamps at a reduced rate based upon its size and cumulative income. The food stamps are then used to purchase food at retail stores, and the Government redeems the stamps at face value, thereby paying the difference between the actual cost of the food and the amount paid by the household for the stamps.</p>
<p id="fbe91237-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As initially enacted, §3(e) defined a “household” as “a group of related or non-related individuals, who are not residents of an institution or boarding house, but are living as one economic unit sharing common cooking facilities and for whom food is customarily purchased in common.” In January 1971, however Congress redefined the term “household” so as to include only groups of related individuals. Pursuant to this amendment, the Secretary of Agriculture promulgated regulations rendering ineligible for participation in the program any “household” whose members are not “all related to each other.”</p>
<p id="fbe91238-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees in this case consist of several groups of individuals who allege that, although they satisfy the income eligibility requirements for federal food assistance, they have nevertheless been excluded from the program solely because the persons in each group are not “all related to each other.” Appellee Jacinta Moreno, for example is a 56-year-old diabetic who lives with Ermina Sanchez and the latter’s three children. They share common living expenses, and Mrs. Sanchez helps to care for appellee. Appellee’s monthly income, derived from public assistance, is $75; Mrs. Sanchez receives $133 per month from public assistance. The household pays $135 per month for rent, gas and electricity, of which appellee pays $50. Appellee spends $10 per month for transportation to a hospital for regular visits, and $5 per month for laundry. That leaves her $10 per month for food and other necessities. Despite her poverty, appellee has been denied federal food assistance solely because she is unrelated to the other members of her household. Moreover, although Mrs. Sanchez and her three children were permitted to purchase $108 worth of food stamps per month for <span title="706" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-706">p. 706</span>$18, their participation in the program will be terminated if appellee Moreno continues to live with them.</p>

<p id="fbe9123a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under traditional equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained, if the classification itself is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The challenged statutory classification (households of related persons versus households containing one or more unrelated persons) is clearly irrelevant to the stated purposes of the Act. As the District Court recognized, “[t]he relationships among persons constituting one economic unit and sharing cooking facilities have nothing to do with their abilities to stimulate the agricultural economy by purchasing farm surpluses, or with their personal nutritional requirements.”</p>
<p id="fbe9123b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, if it is to be sustained, the challenged classification must rationally further some legitimate governmental interest other than those specifically stated in the congressional “declaration of policy.” Regrettably, there is little legislative history to illuminate the purposes of the 1971 amendment of §3(e). The legislative history that does exist, however, indicates that that amendment was intended to prevent so-called “hippies” and “hippie communes” from participating in the food stamp program. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 91—1793, p. 8; 116 Cong. Rec. 44439 (1970) (Sen. Holland). The challenged classification clearly cannot be sustained by reference to this congressional purpose. For if the constitutional conception of “equal protection of the laws” means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest. As a result, “[a] purpose to discriminate against hippies cannot, in and of itself and without reference to [some independent] considerations in the public interest, justify the 1971 amendment.”</p>
<p id="fbe9123c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although apparently conceding this point, the Government maintains that the challenged classification should nevertheless be upheld as rationally related to the clearly legitimate governmental interest in minimizing fraud in the administration of the food stamp program. In essence, the Government contends that, in adopting the 1971 amendment, Congress might rationally have thought (1) that households with one or more unrelated members are more likely than “fully related” households to contain individuals who abuse the program by fraudulently failing to report sources of income or by voluntarily remaining poor; and (2) that such households are “relatively unstable,” thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting such abuses. But even if we were to accept as rational the Government’s wholly unsubstantiated assumptions concerning the differences between “related” and “unrelated” households we still could not agree with the Government’s conclusion that the denial of essential federal food assistance to all otherwise eligible households containing unrelated members constitutes a rational effort to deal with these concerns.</p>
<p id="fbe9394d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, it is important to note that the Food Stamp Act itself contains provisions, wholly independent of §3(e), aimed specifically at the problems of fraud and of the voluntarily poor. For example, with certain exceptions, the Act renders ineligible for assistance any household containing “an able-bodied adult person between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five” who fails to register <span title="707" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-707">p. 707</span>for, and accept, offered employment. Similarly, [the Act] specifically impose[s] strict criminal penalties upon any individual who obtains or uses food stamps fraudulently. The existence of these provisions necessarily casts considerable doubt upon the proposition that the 1971 amendment could rationally have been intended to prevent those very same abuses.</p>
<p id="fbe9394e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, in practical effect, the challenged classification simply does not operate so as rationally to further the prevention of fraud. [I]n practical operation, the 1971 amendment excludes from participation in the food stamp program, not those persons who are “likely to abuse the program,” but, rather, only those persons who are so desperately in need of aid that they cannot even afford to alter their living arrangements so as to retain their eligibility. Traditional equal protection analysis does not require that every classification be drawn with precise “mathematical nicety.” But the classification here in issue is not only “imprecise,” it is wholly without any rational basis.</p>
<p id="fbe9394f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> concurs, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbe93950-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here appellees challenged a provision in the Federal Food Stamp Act which limited food stamps to related people living in one “household.” The result of this provision is that unrelated persons who live under the same roof and pool their resources may not obtain food stamps even though otherwise eligible.</p>
<p id="fbe93951-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s opinion would make a very persuasive congressional committee report arguing against the adoption of the limitation in question. Undoubtedly, Congress attacked the problem with a rather blunt instrument and, just as undoubtedly, persuasive arguments may be made that what we conceive to be its purpose will not be significantly advanced by the enactment of the limitation. But questions such as this are for Congress, rather than for this Court; our role is limited to the determination of whether there is any rational basis on which Congress could decide that public funds made available under the food stamp program should not go to a household containing an individual who is unrelated to any other member of the household.</p>
<p id="fbe93952-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limitation which Congress enacted could, in the judgment of reasonable men, conceivably deny food stamps to members of households which have been formed solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the food stamp program. Since the food stamp program is not intended to be a subsidy for every individual who desires low-cost food, this was a permissible congressional decision quite consistent with the underlying policy of the Act. The fact that the limitation will have unfortunate and perhaps unintended consequences beyond this does not make it unconstitutional.</p>

It was anticipated that the home would house 13 retarded men and women, who would be under the constant supervision of CLC staff members. The house had four bedrooms and two baths, with a half bath to be added. CLC planned to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.</p>

<p id="fbe9395e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e conclude for several reasons that the Court of Appeals erred in holding mental retardation a quasi-suspect classification calling for a more exacting standard of judicial review than is normally accorded economic and social legislation. First, it is undeniable, and it is not argued otherwise here, that those who are mentally retarded have a reduced ability to cope with and function in the everyday world. Nor are they all cut from the same pattern: as the testimony in this record indicates, they range from those whose disability is not immediately evident to those who must be constantly cared for. They are thus different, immutably so, in relevant respects, and the States’ interest in dealing with and providing for them is plainly a legitimate one. How this large and diversified group is to be treated under the law is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary. Heightened scrutiny inevitably involves substantive judgments about legislative decisions, and we doubt that the predicate for such judicial oversight is present where the classification deals with mental retardation.</p>
<p id="fbe9395f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the distinctive legislative response, both national and state, to the plight of those who are mentally retarded demonstrates not only that they have unique problems, but also that the lawmakers have been addressing their difficulties in a manner that belies a continuing antipathy or prejudice and a corresponding need for more intrusive oversight by the judiciary. Thus, the Federal Government has not only outlawed discrimination against the mentally retarded in federally funded programs, but it has also provided the retarded with the right to receive “appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation” in a setting that is “least restrictive of [their] personal liberty.”</p>
<p id="fbe96070-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such legislation thus singling out the retarded for special treatment reflects the real and undeniable differences between the retarded and others. That a civilized and decent society expects and approves such legislation indicates that governmental consideration of those differences in the vast majority of situations is not only legitimate but also desirable.</p>
<p id="fbe96071-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-709">p. 709</span>Even assuming that many of these laws could be shown to be substantially related to an important governmental purpose, merely requiring the legislature to justify its efforts in these terms may lead it to refrain from acting at all. Much recent legislation intended to benefit the retarded also assumes the need for measures that might be perceived to disadvantage them. The Education of the Handicapped Act, for example, requires an “appropriate” education, not one that is equal in all respects to the education of nonretarded children; clearly, admission to a class that exceeded the abilities of a retarded child would not be appropriate. Similarly, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance Act and the Texas Act give the retarded the right to live only in the “least restrictive setting” appropriate to their abilities, implicitly assuming the need for at least some restrictions that would not be imposed on others. Especially given the wide variation in the abilities and needs of the retarded themselves, governmental bodies must have a certain amount of flexibility and freedom from judicial oversight in shaping and limiting their remedial efforts.</p>
<p id="fbe96072-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the legislative response, which could hardly have occurred and survived without public support, negates any claim that the mentally retarded are politically powerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract the attention of the lawmakers. Any minority can be said to be powerless to assert direct control over the legislature, but if that were a criterion for higher level scrutiny by the courts, much economic and social legislation would now be suspect.</p>
<p id="fbe96073-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, if the large and amorphous class of the mentally retarded were deemed quasi-suspect for the reasons given by the Court of Appeals, it would be difficult to find a principled way to distinguish a variety of other groups who have perhaps immutable disabilities setting them off from others, who cannot themselves mandate the desired legislative responses, and who can claim some degree of prejudice from at least part of the public at large. One need mention in this respect only the aging, the disabled, the mentally ill, and the infirm. We are reluctant to set out on that course, and we decline to do so.</p>
<p id="fbe96074-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our refusal to recognize the retarded as a quasi-suspect class does not leave them entirely unprotected from invidious discrimination. To withstand equal protection review, legislation that distinguishes between the mentally retarded and others must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. This standard, we believe, affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue policies designed to assist the retarded in realizing their full potential, and to freely and efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essentially an incidental manner. The State may not rely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.</p>

<p id="fbe96076-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional issue is clearly posed. The city does not require a special use permit in an R-3 zone for apartment houses, multiple dwellings, boarding and lodging houses, fraternity or sorority houses, dormitories, apartment hotels, hospitals, sanitariums, nursing homes for convalescents or the aged (other than for the insane or feebleminded or alcoholics or drug addicts), private clubs or fraternal orders, and other specified uses. It does, however, insist on a special permit for the Featherston home, and it does so, as the District Court found, <span title="710" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-710">p. 710</span>because it would be a facility for the mentally retarded. May the city require the permit for this facility when other care and multiple-dwelling facilities are freely permitted?</p>
<p id="fbe96077-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, as already pointed out, that the mentally retarded as a group are indeed different from others not sharing their misfortune, and in this respect they may be different from those who would occupy other facilities that would be permitted in an R-3 zone without a special permit. But this difference is largely irrelevant unless the Featherston home and those who would occupy it would threaten legitimate interests of the city in a way that other permitted uses such as boarding houses and hospitals would not. Because in our view the record does not reveal any rational basis for believing that the Featherston home would pose any special threat to the city’s legitimate interests, we affirm the judgment below insofar as it holds the ordinance invalid as applied in this case.</p>
<p id="fbe96078-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that the City Council’s insistence on the permit rested on several factors. First, the Council was concerned with the negative attitude of the majority of property owners located within 200 feet of the Featherston facility, as well as with the fears of elderly residents of the neighborhood. But mere negative attitudes, or fear, unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning proceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home for the mentally retarded differently from apartment houses, multiple dwellings, and the like. It is plain that the electorate as a whole, whether by referendum or otherwise, could not order city action violative of the Equal Protection Clause, and the City may not avoid the strictures of that Clause by deferring to the wishes or objections of some fraction of the body politic. “Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.”</p>
<p id="fbe96079-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Council had two objections to the location of the facility. It was concerned that the facility was across the street from a junior high school, and it feared that the students might harass the occupants of the Featherston home. But the school itself is attended by about 30 mentally retarded students, and denying a permit based on such vague, undifferentiated fears is again permitting some portion of the community to validate what would otherwise be an equal protection violation. The other objection to the home’s location was that it was located on “a five hundred year flood plain.” This concern with the possibility of a flood, however, can hardly be based on a distinction between the Featherston home and, for example, nursing homes, homes for convalescents or the aged, or sanitariums or hospitals, any of which could be located on the Featherston site without obtaining a special use permit. The same may be said of another concern of the Council—doubts about the legal responsibility for actions which the mentally retarded might take. If there is no concern about legal responsibility with respect to other uses that would be permitted in the area, such as boarding and fraternity houses, it is difficult to believe that the groups of mildly or moderately mentally retarded individuals who would live at 201 Featherston would present any different or special hazard.</p>
<p id="fbe9607a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the Council was concerned with the size of the home and the number of people that would occupy it. The District Court found, and the Court of Appeals repeated, that “[i]f the potential residents of the Featherston Street home were not mentally retarded, but the home was the same in all other respects, its use would be permitted under the city’s zoning ordinance.” Given this finding, there would be no restrictions on the number of people who <span title="711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-711">p. 711</span>could occupy this home as a boarding house, nursing home, family dwelling, fraternity house, or dormitory. The question is whether it is rational to treat the mentally retarded differently. It is true that they suffer disability not shared by others; but why this difference warrants a density regulation that others need not observe is not at all apparent. At least this record does not clarify how, in this connection, the characteristics of the intended occupants of the Featherston home rationally justify denying to those occupants what would be permitted to groups occupying the same site for different purposes. Those who would live in the Featherston home are the type of individuals who, with supporting staff, satisfy federal and state standards for group housing in the community; and there is no dispute that the home would meet the federal square-footage-per-resident requirement for facilities of this type. In the words of the Court of Appeals, “[t]he City never justifies its apparent view that other people can live under such ‘crowded’ conditions when mentally retarded persons cannot.”</p>

These concerns obviously fail to explain why apartment houses, fraternity and sorority houses, hospitals and the like, may freely locate in the area without a permit. So, too, the expressed worry about fire hazards, the serenity of the neighborhood, and the avoidance of danger to other residents fail rationally to justify singling out a home such as 201 Featherston for the special use permit, yet imposing no such restrictions on the many other uses freely permitted in the neighborhood.</p>
<p id="fbe9607c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The short of it is that requiring the permit in this case appears to us to rest on an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded, including those who would occupy the Featherston facility and who would live under the closely supervised and highly regulated conditions expressly provided for by state and federal law.</p>

<p id="fbe9878f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of all in the infinite array of distinctions drawn by American governments in the past 230 years, none has been more important than race discrimination. Some injustices are so enormous as to defy comprehension. Slavery, the apartheid that followed it in much of the country, and the systematic race discrimination that has existed throughout the nation are a profound embarrassment and a human tragedy of incalculable dimensions.</p>
<p id="fbe98790-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing discrimination based on race and national origin, this section begins in subsection 1 by looking at race discrimination and slavery before the Civil War. Subsection 2 explains that strict scrutiny is used for evaluating race and national origin classifications.</p>
<p id="fbe98791-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection 3 focuses on the question of how the existence of a race or national origin classification can be proven. There are two ways of proving such discrimination. One is where the classification exists on the face of the law; that is, the law in its very terms draws a distinction among people based on race or national origin. Alternatively, if a law is facially neutral, a racial classification can <span title="712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-712">p. 712</span>be proven by demonstrating that the law has a discriminatory purpose and a discriminatory impact. Each of these is discussed in turn.</p>
<p id="fbe98792-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No area of race discrimination has produced more litigation or has been more difficult for the courts than the problem of school segregation. Subsection 4 examines the issues surrounding remedies for school segregation.</p>
<p id="fbe98793-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, subsection 5 discusses racial classifications that benefit minorities. This, of course, is the controversial issue of affirmative action that has produced a number of major Supreme Court decisions in recent years.</p>

<p id="fbe98796-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, slavery was constitutional. Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there was no constitutional assurance of equal protection and thus no limit on race discrimination. Despite the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal,” blacks were anything but equal under the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbe98797-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several constitutional provisions expressly protected aspects of the institution of slavery. Article I, §2 requires apportionment of the House of Representatives based on the “whole Number of free Persons” and “three fifths of all other Persons.” Article I, §9 prevented Congress from banning the importation of slaves until 1808 and Article V of the Constitution prohibited this provision from being altered by constitutional amendment. Article IV, §2 contains the Fugitive Slave Clause, which provided, “No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.”</p>
<p id="fbe98798-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Southern states simply would not have accepted a Constitution that abolished slavery. Additionally, many of the most influential drafters at the Constitutional Convention were slave owners. For example, such prominent framers as George Washington, James Madison, and John Rutledge all owned slaves.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105DA_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105DA_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span> The result was a Constitution that protected the institution of slavery.</p>
<p id="fbe9aeaa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judiciary consistently enforced the institution of slavery by ruling in favor of slaveowners and against slaves.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105E9_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105E9_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">37</a></span> For example, the Court enforced the Fugitive Slave Clause and prevented Northern states from protecting escaped slaves. In Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that prevented the use of force or violence to remove any person from the state to return the individual to slavery. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, adopted by the second Congress, required that judges return escaped slaves. In <i>Prigg</i>, the Supreme Court relied on this statute and the Fugitive Slave Clause to invalidate the Pennsylvania law. Justice Joseph Story, writing for the Court, held that the Constitution prohibited states from interfering with the return of fugitive slaves. The Court explained that <span title="713" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-713">p. 713</span>the “object of this clause was to secure to the citizens of the slaveholding states the complete right and title of ownership in their slaves, as property, in every state in the Union into which they might escape from the state where they were held in servitude.” Indeed, the Court said that the Fugitive Slave Clause “was so vital . . . that it cannot be doubted that it constituted a fundamental article, without the adoption of which the Union could not have been formed.” Thus, the Court concluded that “we have not the slightest hesitation in holding, that, under and in virtue of the Constitution, the owner of a slave is clothed with entire authority, in every state in the Union, to seize and recapture his slave.” Likewise, the Court also held that states could punish those who harbored fugitive slaves.</p>
<p id="fbe9aeac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At no point prior to the Civil War did the Supreme Court significantly limit slavery or even raise serious questions about its constitutionality.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105FE_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105FE_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">38</a></span> Nor were state courts, even in the North, a significant force in ending slavery. For example, in State v. Post, 20 N.J.L. 368 (1845), the Supreme Court of New Jersey rejected a claim that the state constitution abolished slavery. The Court said that “it has been often adjudged, both by the State and Federal courts, that slavery still exists; that the master’s right of property in the slave has not been affected either by the declaration of independence, or the constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fbe9aeae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The importance of slavery as a social and political issue during this time period cannot be overstated. Every discussion of the relationship between the federal and state governments was directly or indirectly about the slavery question. It was the central dispute of the time and affected almost all other issues.</p>
<div id="fbe9aeaf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbe9aeb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>DRED SCOTT v. SANDFORD</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbe9d5c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1819, a major national controversy surrounded the admission of Missouri as a state and whether it, and other areas covered by the Louisiana Purchase, would be free or slave states. In a compromise that was intended to resolve the issue, known as the Missouri Compromise, Congress admitted Missouri as a slave state but prohibited slavery in the territories north of the latitude of 36°30′. Territories below this line could decide whether to allow slavery and could make that choice when admitted as states.</p>
<p id="fbe9d5c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Dred Scott v. Sandford, which follows, the Supreme Court declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional and broadly held that slaves were property, not citizens. Dred Scott, a slave owned in Missouri by John Emerson, was taken into Illinois, a free state. After Emerson died, John Sanford, a resident of New York, administered his estate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10620_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10620_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">39</a></span> Scott sued Sanford in federal court, basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, and claimed that his residence in Illinois made him a free person.</p>
<p id="fbe9d5c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Scott in a decision that fills more than 200 pages in the United States Reports.</p>

<p id="fbe9d5cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is simply this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were imported into this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to all the rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that instrument to the citizen?</p>
<p id="fbe9fcdc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of which rights is the privilege of suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified in the Constitution. The words “people of the United States” and “citizens” are synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the “sovereign people,” and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We think they are not, and that they are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word “citizens” in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.</p>
<p id="fbe9fcdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or injustice, the policy or impolicy, of these laws. The decision of that question belonged to the political or law-making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and framed the Constitution. The duty of the court is, to interpret the instrument they have framed, with the best lights we can obtain on the subject, and to administer it as we find it, according to its true intent and meaning when it was adopted.</p>
<p id="fbe9fcde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing this question, we must not confound the rights of citizenship which a State may confer within its own limits, and the rights of citizenship as a member of the Union. It does not by any means follow, because he has all the rights and privileges of a citizen of a State, that he must be a citizen of the United States. He may have all of the rights and privileges of the citizen of a State, and yet not be entitled to the rights and privileges of such courts, or rules that may have been laid down by common-law pleaders, can have no influence in the decision in this court. Because, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the rules which govern the pleadings in its courts, in questions of jurisdiction, stand on different principles and are regulated by different laws.</p>
<p id="fbe9fcdf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he question to be decided is, whether the facts stated in the plea are sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the United States. This is certainly a very serious question, and one that now for the first time has been brought for decision before this court. But it is brought here by those who have a right to bring it, and it is our duty to meet it and decide it.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will be observed, that the plea applies to that class of persons only whose ancestors were negroes of the African race, and imported into this country, and <span title="715" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-715">p. 715</span>sold and held as slaves. The only matter in issue before the court, therefore, is, whether the descendants of such slaves, when they shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who had become free before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the sense in which the word citizen is used in the Constitution of the United States. And this being the only matter in dispute on the pleadings, the court must be understood as speaking in this opinion of that class only, that is, of those persons who are the descendants of Africans who were imported into this country, and sold as slaves.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation of this population was altogether unlike that of the Indian race. The latter, it is true, formed no part of the colonial communities, and never amalgamated with them in social connections or in government. But although they were uncivilized, they were yet a free and independent people, associated together in nations or tribes, and governed by their own laws. Many of these political communities were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate right of dominion. But that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the right of the Indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper, and neither the English nor colonial Governments claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied, nor claimed the right to the possession of the territory, until the tribe or nation consented to cede it. These Indian Governments were regarded and treated as foreign Governments, as much so as if an ocean had separated the red man from the white; and their freedom has constantly been acknowledged, from the time of the first emigration to the English colonies to the present day, by the different Governments which succeeded each other. Treaties have been negotiated with them, and their alliance sought for in war; and the people who compose these Indian political communities have always been treated as foreigners not living under our Government. It is true that the course of events has brought the Indian tribes within the limits of the United States under subjection to the white race; and it has been found necessary, for their sake as well as our own, to regard them as in a state of pupilage, and to legislate to a certain extent over them and the territory they occupy. But they may, without doubt, like the subjects of any other foreign Government, be naturalized by the authority of Congress, and become citizens of a State, and of the United States; and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe, and take up his abode among the white population, he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other foreign people.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language of the Declaration of Independence is equally conclusive: It . . . says: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among them is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood. But it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration; for if the language, as understood in that day, would embrace them, the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they asserted; and instead of the <span title="716" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-716">p. 716</span>sympathy of mankind, to which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection. And upon a full and careful consideration of the subject, the court is of opinion, that, upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement, Dred Scott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and not entitled as such to sue in its courts; and, consequently, that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the case, and that the judgment on the plea in abatement is erroneous.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The act of Congress, upon which the plaintiff relies, declares that slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, shall be forever prohibited in all that part of the territory ceded by France, under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, and not included within the limits of Missouri. And the difficulty which meets us at the threshold of this part of the inquiry is, whether Congress was authorized to pass this law under any of the powers granted to it by the Constitution; for if the authority is not given by that instrument, it is the duty of this court to declare it void and inoperative, and incapable of conferring freedom upon any one who is held as a slave under the laws of any one of the States.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now, as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, upon a different point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution. The right to traffic in it, like an ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guarantied to the citizens of the United States, in every State that might desire it, for twenty years. And the Government in express terms is pledged to protect it in all future time, if the slave escapes from his owner. This is done in plain words—too plain to be misunderstood. And no word can be found in the Constitution which gives Congress a greater power over slave property, or which entitles property of that kind to less protection than property of any other description. The only power conferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting the owner in his rights.</p>
<p id="fbe9fce6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon these considerations, it is the opinion of the court that the act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property of this kind in the territory of the United States north of the line therein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore void; and that neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his family, were made free by being carried into this territory; even if they had been carried there by the owner, with the intention of becoming a permanent resident.</p>

<p id="fbea2400-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It now is clearly established that racial classifications will be allowed only if the government can meet the heavy burden of demonstrating that the discrimination is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106BF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106BF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">42</a></span> In other words, the government must show an extremely important reason for its action <i>and</i> it must demonstrate that the goal cannot be achieved through any less discriminatory alternative.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106CD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106CD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">43</a></span> The Court has expressly declared that all racial classifications—whether disadvantaging or helping minorities—must meet strict scrutiny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106D3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106D3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">44</a></span></p>
<p id="fbea2404-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ironically, the Supreme Court first articulated the requirement for strict scrutiny for discrimination based on race and national origin in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) (presented below), which upheld the constitutionality of the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II. The Court declared, “[A]ll legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racial antagonism never can.”</p>

These justifications are important both in understanding the Court’s approach to racial discrimination and also in evaluating whether other types of discrimination warrant heightened scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbea4b16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court long has recognized that the primary purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to protect African Americans; in fact, the initial Supreme Court decisions construing the Equal Protection Clause suggested that it could be used only to protect blacks.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106EA_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106EA_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">45</a></span> The Court has emphasized that the long history of racial discrimination makes it likely that racial classifications will be based on stereotypes and prejudices. Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, “A core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race. Classifying persons according to their race is more likely to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106F3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106F3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">46</a></span></p>
<p id="fbea4b19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, heightened scrutiny for government actions discriminating against racial and national origin minorities is justified because of the relative political powerlessness of these groups. In the famous <i>Carolene Products</i> footnote, the Supreme Court indicated that “prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities” and thus “may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106FF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106FF_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">47</a></span> Prejudice and the history of discrimination make it less likely that racial and national origin minorities can protect themselves through the political process.</p>
<p id="fbea4b1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, the Court has emphasized that race is an immutable trait.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10709_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10709_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">48</a></span> It is unfair to discriminate against people for a characteristic that is acquired at birth and cannot be changed.</p>
<p id="fbea4b1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all of these reasons, it is firmly established that race and national origin classifications must meet the most exacting standard of judicial review. Such discrimination will be tolerated only if the government can prove that it is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.</p>

<p id="fbea4b20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two alternative ways of demonstrating the existence of a race or national origin classification. One is where the classification exists on the face of the law; that is, the text of the law draws a distinction among people based on race or national origin. Alternatively, if a law is facially neutral, a race or national origin classification might be proven by demonstrating discriminatory administration or discriminatory impact; however, the Supreme Court has held that this also requires proof of a discriminatory purpose. Subsection a looks at racial classifications on the face of the law, and subsection b considers facially neutral laws with a discriminatory impact or with discriminatory administration.</p>

<p id="fbea7236-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, there are laws that expressly impose a burden or disadvantage on people because of their race or national origin. For example, in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 303 (1879), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a West Virginia law that limited jury service to “white male persons who are twenty-one years of age and who are citizens of this State.” The Court explained that the Fourteenth Amendment was “designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government, in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States.” The Court declared the law unconstitutional because it expressly “singled out” and disadvantaged blacks.</p>
<p id="fbea7237-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is only one situation in which the Court expressly upheld under equal protection racial classifications burdening minorities: the rulings affirming the constitutionality of the evacuation of Japanese Americans during World War II. During World War II, 110,000 Japanese Americans—adults and children, aliens and citizens—were forcibly uprooted from their homes and placed in concentration camps. In some camps, they were housed in horse stalls and emprisoned behind barbed wire.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10747_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10747_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">49</a></span> The government’s purported justification was national security—a fear that Japanese Americans on the West Coast might aid an invading Japanese army or commit acts of espionage and sabotage. No evidence of a specific threat was required to evacuate and intern a person. Race alone was used to determine who would be uprooted and incarcerated and who would remain free.</p>
<p id="fbea7239-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you read Korematsu v.

<p id="fbea994f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Black</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbea9950-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioner, an American citizen of Japanese descent, was convicted in a federal district court for remaining in San Leandro, California, a “Military Area,” contrary to Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the Commanding General of the Western Command, U.S. Army, which directed that after May 9, 1942, all <span title="720" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-720">p. 720</span>persons of Japanese ancestry should be excluded from that area. No question was raised as to petitioner’s loyalty to the United States.</p>
<p id="fbea9951-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be noted, to begin with, that all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racial antagonism never can.</p>
<p id="fbea9952-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the series of orders and proclamations, a curfew order, which like the exclusion order here was promulgated pursuant to Executive Order 9066, subjected all persons of Japanese ancestry in prescribed West Coast military areas to remain in their residences from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. As is the case with the exclusion order here, that prior curfew order was designed as a “protection against espionage and against sabotage.” In Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States (1943), we sustained a conviction obtained for violation of the curfew order. The Hirabayashi conviction and this one thus rest on the same 1942 Congressional Act and the same basic executive and military orders, all of which orders were aimed at the twin dangers of espionage and sabotage.</p>
<p id="fbea9953-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the light of the principles we announced in the <i>Hirabayashi</i> case, we are unable to conclude that it was beyond the war power of Congress and the Executive to exclude those of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast war area at the time they did. True, exclusion from the area in which one’s home is located is a far greater deprivation than constant confinement to the home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Nothing short of apprehension by the proper military authorities of the gravest imminent danger to the public safety can constitutionally justify either. But exclusion from a threatened area, no less than curfew, has a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage. The military authorities, charged with the primary responsibility of defending our shores, concluded that curfew provided inadequate protection and ordered exclusion. They did so, as pointed out in our <i>Hirabayashi</i> opinion, in accordance with Congressional authority to the military to say who should, and who should not, remain in the threatened areas.</p>
<p id="fbea9954-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like curfew, exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country. It was because we could not reject the finding of the military authorities that it was impossible to bring about an immediate segregation of the disloyal from the loyal that we sustained the validity of the curfew order as applying to the whole group. In the instant case, temporary exclusion of the entire group was rested by the military on the same ground. The judgment that exclusion of the whole group was for the same reason a military imperative answers the contention that the exclusion was in the nature of group punishment based on antagonism to those of Japanese origin. That there were members of the group who retained loyalties to Japan has been confirmed by investigations made subsequent to the exclusion. Approximately five thousand American citizens of Japanese ancestry refused to swear unqualified allegiance to the United States and to renounce allegiance to the Japanese Emperor, and several thousand evacuees requested repatriation to Japan.</p>
<p id="fbea9955-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We uphold the exclusion order as of the time it was made and when the petitioner violated it. In doing so, we are not unmindful of the hardships imposed by it upon a large group of American citizens. But hardships are part of war, <span title="721" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-721">p. 721</span>and war is an aggregation of hardships. All citizens alike, both in and out of uniform, feel the impact of war in greater or lesser measure. Citizenship has its responsibilities as well as its privileges, and in time of war the burden is always heavier. Compulsory exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes, except under circumstances of direst emergency and peril, is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions. But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger.</p>
<p id="fbea9956-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast temporarily, and finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders—as inevitably it must—determined that they should have the power to do just this. There was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for action was great, and time was short. We cannot—by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight—now say that at that time these actions were unjustified.</p>
<p id="fbea9957-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Murphy</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbea9958-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This exclusion of “all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien,” from the Pacific Coast area on a plea of military necessity in the absence of martial law ought not to be approved. Such exclusion goes over “the very brink of constitutional power” and falls into the ugly abyss of racism.</p>
<p id="fbea9959-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In dealing with matters relating to the prosecution and progress of a war, we must accord great respect and consideration to the judgments of the military authorities who are on the scene and who have full knowledge of the military facts. The scope of their discretion must, as a matter of necessity and common sense, be wide. And their judgments ought not to be overruled lightly by those whose training and duties ill-equip them to deal intelligently with matters so vital to the physical security of the nation.</p>
<p id="fbea995a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, however, it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion, especially where martial law has not been declared. Individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on a plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support. Thus, like other claims conflicting with the asserted constitutional rights of the individual, the military claim must subject itself to the judicial process of having its reasonableness determined and its conflicts with other interests reconciled. “What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.”</p>
<p id="fbea995b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judicial test of whether the Government, on a plea of military necessity, can validly deprive an individual of any of his constitutional rights is whether the deprivation is reasonably related to a public danger that is so “immediate, imminent, and impending” as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger. Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, banishing from a prescribed area of the Pacific Coast <span title="722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-722">p. 722</span>“all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien,” clearly does not meet that test. Being an obvious racial discrimination, the order deprives all those within its scope of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. It further deprives these individuals of their constitutional rights to live and work where they will, to establish a home where they choose and to move about freely. In excommunicating them without benefit of hearings, this order also deprives them of all their constitutional rights to procedural due process. Yet no reasonable relation to an “immediate, imminent, and impending” public danger is evident to support this racial restriction which is one of the most sweeping and complete deprivations of constitutional rights in the history of this nation in the absence of martial law. The exclusion order necessarily must rely for its reasonableness upon the assumption that all persons of Japanese ancestry may have a dangerous tendency to commit sabotage and espionage and to aid our Japanese enemy in other ways. It is difficult to believe that reason, logic or experience could be marshalled in support of such an assumption.</p>
<p id="fbea995c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That this forced exclusion was the result in good measure of this erroneous assumption of racial guilt rather than bona fide military necessity is evidenced by the Commanding General’s Final Report on the evacuation from the Pacific Coast area. In it he refers to all individuals of Japanese descent as “subversive,” as belonging to “an enemy race” whose “racial strains are undiluted,” and as constituting “over 112,000 potential enemies . . . at large today” along the Pacific Coast. In support of this blanket condemnation of all persons of Japanese descent, however, no reliable evidence is cited to show that such individuals were generally disloyal, or had generally so conducted themselves in this area as to constitute a special menace to defense installations or war industries, or had otherwise by their behavior furnished reasonable ground for their exclusion as a group.</p>
<p id="fbeac06d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main reasons relied upon by those responsible for the forced evacuation, therefore, do not prove a reasonable relation between the group characteristics of Japanese Americans and the dangers of invasion, sabotage and espionage. The reasons appear, instead, to be largely an accumulation of much of the misinformation, half-truths and insinuations that for years have been directed against Japanese Americans by people with racial and economic prejudices—the same people who have been among the foremost advocates of the evacuation. A military judgment based upon such racial and sociological considerations is not entitled to the great weight ordinarily given the judgments based upon strictly military considerations. Especially is this so when every charge relative to race, religion, culture, geographical location, and legal and economic status has been substantially discredited by independent studies made by experts in these matters.</p>
<p id="fbeac06e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The military necessity which is essential to the validity of the evacuation order thus resolves itself into a few intimations that certain individuals actively aided the enemy, from which it is inferred that the entire group of Japanese Americans could not be trusted to be or remain loyal to the United States. Moreover, this inference, which is at the very heart of the evacuation orders, has been used in support of the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy. To give constitutional sanction to that inference in this case, however well-intentioned may have been the military command on the Pacific Coast, is to adopt one of the cruelest of the rationales used by our enemies to destroy the dignity of <span title="723" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-723">p. 723</span>the individual and to encourage and open the door to discriminatory actions against other minority groups in the passions of tomorrow. No adequate reason is given for the failure to treat these Japanese Americans on an individual basis by holding investigations and hearings to separate the loyal from the disloyal, as was done in the case of persons of German and Italian ancestry.</p>
<p id="fbeac06f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, there was no adequate proof that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the military and naval intelligence services did not have the espionage and sabotage situation well in hand during this long period. Nor is there any denial of the fact that not one person of Japanese ancestry was accused or convicted of espionage or sabotage after Pearl Harbor while they were still free. It seems incredible that under these circumstances it would have been impossible to hold loyalty hearings for the mere 112,000 persons involved—or at least for the 70,000 American citizens—especially when a large part of this number represented children and elderly men and women. Any inconvenience that may have accompanied an attempt to conform to procedural due process cannot be said to justify violations of constitutional rights of individuals.</p>
<p id="fbeac070-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During a period of six months, the 112 alien tribunals or hearing boards set up by the British Government shortly after the outbreak of the present war summoned and examined approximately 74,000 German and Austrian aliens. These tribunals determined whether each individual enemy alien was a real enemy of the Allies or only a “friendly enemy.” About 64,000 were freed from internment and from any special restrictions, and only 2,000 were interned.

<p id="fbeac071-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in any setting but it is utterly revolting among a free people who have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States. All residents of this nation are kin in some way by blood or culture to a foreign land. Yet they are primarily and necessarily a part of the new and distinct civilization of the United States.

There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here he is not law-abiding and well disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.</p>
<p id="fbeac074-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even more unusual is the series of military orders which made this conduct a crime.

The Court’s holding was narrow, simply concluding that the executive orders that provided the authority for the evacuation of Japanese Americans did not expressly authorize the continued detention of loyal Japanese Americans. The Court did observe that “[a] citizen who is concededly loyal presents no problem of espionage or sabotage. Loyalty is a matter of the heart and mind, not of race, creed, or color.” Yet the Court never declared the evacuation and internment of Japanese Americans unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fbeac07a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second type of racial classification that can exist on the face of the law is government action that burdens both whites and minorities. For example, antimiscegenation laws—statutes that prohibit interracial cohabitation and marriage—apply to both whites and blacks. In fact, the Supreme Court initially upheld such laws on the ground that they did not discriminate; the Court saw them as treating blacks and whites equally. In Pace v. Alabama, 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 583 (1882), the Court upheld an Alabama law that provided for harsher penalties for adultery and fornication if the couple were composed of a white and a black than if the couple were both of the same race.</p>
<p id="fbeac07b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, however, the Court recognized that such racial classifications are impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause because they are based on assumptions of the inferiority of blacks to whites. In McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Florida law that prohibited the habitual occupation of a room at night by unmarried interracial couples. The Court indicated that <i>Pace</i> “represents a limited view of the Equal Protection Clause which has not withstood analysis in the subsequent decisions of this Court.” The Court emphasized that the state offered no acceptable justification for why a race-neutral law could not adequately serve its purposes of punishing premarital sexual relations.</p>

<p id="fbeae794-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents a constitutional question never addressed by this Court: whether a statutory scheme adopted by the State of Virginia to prevent marriages between persons solely on the basis of racial classifications violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. For reasons which seem to us to reflect the central meaning of those constitutional commands, we conclude that these statutes cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbeae795-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1958, two residents of Virginia, Mildred Jeter, a Negro woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were married in the District of Columbia pursuant to its laws. Shortly after their marriage, the Lovings returned to Virginia and established their marital abode in Caroline County. At the October Term, 1958, of the Circuit Court of Caroline County, a grand jury issued an indictment charging the Lovings with violating Virginia’s ban on interracial marriages. On January 6, 1959, the Lovings pleaded guilty to the charge and were sentenced to one year in jail; however, the trial judge suspended the sentence for a period of 25 years on the condition that the Lovings leave the State and not return to Virginia together for 25 years. He stated in an opinion that:</p>

And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbeae797-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After their convictions, the Lovings took up residence in the District of Columbia. On November 6, 1963, they filed a motion in the state trial court to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence on the ground that the statutes which they had violated were repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the antimiscegenation statutes and, after modifying the sentence, affirmed the convictions.</p>
<p id="fbeae798-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia is now one of 16 States which prohibit and punish marriages on the basis of racial classifications. Penalties for miscegenation arose as an incident to slavery and have been common in Virginia since the colonial period. The present statutory scheme dates from the adoption of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, passed during the period of extreme nativism which followed the end of the First World War. The central features of this Act, and current Virginia law, are the absolute prohibition of a “white person” marrying other than another “white person,” a prohibition against issuing marriage licenses until the issuing official is satisfied that the applicants’ statements as to their <span title="726" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-726">p. 726</span>race are correct, certificates of “racial composition” to be kept by both local and state registrars, and the carrying forward of earlier prohibitions against racial intermarriage. Over the past 15 years, 14 States have repealed laws outlawing interracial marriages: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.</p>
<p id="fbeae799-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In upholding the constitutionality of these provisions in the decision below, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia referred to its 1955 decision in Naim v. Naim, as stating the reasons supporting the validity of these laws. In <i>Naim</i>, the state court concluded that the State’s legitimate purposes were “to preserve the racial integrity of its citizens,” and to prevent “the corruption of blood,” “a mongrel breed of citizens,” and “the obliteration of racial pride,” obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White Supremacy. The court also reasoned that marriage has traditionally been subject to state regulation without federal intervention, and, consequently, the regulation of marriage should be left to exclusive state control by the Tenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbeae79a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he State argues that the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, as illuminated by the statements of the framers, is only that state penal laws containing an interracial element as part of the definition of the offense must apply equally to whites and Negroes in the sense that members of each race are punished to the same degree. Thus, the State contends that, because its miscegenation statutes punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage, these statutes, despite their reliance on racial classifications do not constitute an invidious discrimination based upon race.</p>
<p id="fbeae79b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e reject the notion that the mere “equal application” of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment’s proscription of all invidious racial discriminations.</p>
<p id="fbeae79c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no question but that Virginia’s miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races. Over the years, this Court has consistently repudiated “[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry” as being “odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.” At the very least, the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications, especially suspect in criminal statutes, be subjected, to the “most rigid scrutiny,” Korematsu v. United States (1944), and, if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective, independent of the racial discrimination which it was the object of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate.</p>
<p id="fbeae79d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy. We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbeb0eb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari to review a judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child because of her remarriage to a person of a different race.</p>
<p id="fbeb0eb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When petitioner Linda Sidoti Palmore and respondent Anthony J. Sidoti, both Caucasians, were divorced in May 1980 in Florida, the mother was awarded custody of their 3-year-old daughter. In September 1981 the father sought custody of the child by filing a petition to modify the prior judgment because of changed conditions. The change was that the child’s mother was then cohabiting with a Negro, Clarence Palmore, Jr., whom she married two months later. Additionally, the father made several allegations of instances in which the mother had not properly cared for the child.</p>
<p id="fbeb0eb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After hearing testimony from both parties and considering a court counselor’s investigative report, the court noted that the father had made allegations about the child’s care, but the court made no findings with respect to these allegations. On the contrary, the court made a finding that “there is no issue as to either party’s devotion to the child, adequacy of housing facilities, or respectability of the new spouse of either parent.”</p>
<p id="fbeb0eb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he court then noted the counselor’s recommendation for a change in custody because “[t]he wife [petitioner] has chosen for herself and for her child, a life-style unacceptable to the father and to society. . . . The child . . . is, or at school age will be, subject to environmental pressures not of choice.” The court then concluded that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding custody to the father. The court’s rationale is contained in the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbeb0eb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The father’s evident resentment of the mother’s choice of a black partner is not sufficient to wrest custody from the mother. It is of some significance, however, that the mother did see fit to bring a man into her home and carry on a sexual relationship with him without being married to him. Such action tended to place gratification of her own desires ahead of her concern for the child’s future welfare. This Court feels that despite the strides that have been made in bettering relations between the races in this country, it is inevitable that Melanie will, if allowed to remain in her present situation and attains school age and thus more vulnerable to peer pressures, suffer from the social stigmatization that is sure to come.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbeb0eba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of a state court determining or reviewing a child custody decision is not ordinarily a likely candidate for review by this Court. However, the court’s opinion, after stating that the “father’s evident resentment of the mother’s choice of a black partner is not sufficient” to deprive her of custody, then turns to what it regarded as the damaging impact on the child from remaining in a racially mixed household. This raises important federal concerns arising from the Constitution’s commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.</p>
<p id="fbeb0ebb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="728" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-728">p. 728</span>It would ignore reality to suggest that racial and ethnic prejudices do not exist or that all manifestations of those prejudices have been eliminated. There is a risk that a child living with a stepparent of a different race may be subject to a variety of pressures and stresses not present if the child were living with parents of the same racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p id="fbeb0ebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question, however, is whether the reality of private biases and the possible injury they might inflict are permissible considerations for removal of an infant child from the custody of its natural mother. We have little difficulty concluding that they are not. The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect. “Public officials sworn to uphold the Constitution may not avoid a constitutional duty by bowing to the hypothetical effects of private racial prejudice that they assume to be both widely and deeply held.” The effects of racial prejudice, however real, cannot justify a racial classification removing an infant child from the custody of its natural mother found to be an appropriate person to have such custody.</p>

In part, it ended through a compromise in 1877 to resolve a disputed presidential election. Although it appeared that Democrat Samuel Tilden won a majority of the popular vote, Democrats in Congress agreed to the election of Republican Rutherford Hayes in exchange for an end of military rule in the South. Also, in 1883, in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which prohibited discrimination by places of public accommodations such as inns, theaters, and places of public amusement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108DD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N108DD_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">52</a></span> The Supreme Court broadly held that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to government action, not to private conduct, and that therefore Congress acting under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment can regulate only government actions.</p>

The first section of the statute enacts “that all railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in this state, shall provide equal but separate accommodations for the white, and colored races, by providing two or more passenger coaches for each passenger train, or by dividing the passenger coaches by a partition so as to secure separate accommodations: provided, that this section shall not be construed to apply to street railroads. No person or persons shall be permitted to occupy seats in coaches, other than the ones assigned to them, on account of the race they belong to.”</p>
<p id="fbeb35de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petition for the writ of prohibition averred that petitioner was seven-eighths Caucasian and one-eighth African blood; that the mixture of colored blood was not discernible in him; and that he was entitled to every right, privilege, and immunity secured to citizens of the United States of the white race; and that, upon such theory, he took possession of a vacant seat in a coach where passengers of the white race were accommodated, and was ordered by the conductor to vacate said coach, and take a seat in another, assigned to persons of the colored race, and, having refused to comply with such demand, he was forcibly ejected, with the aid of a police officer, and imprisoned in the parish jail to answer a charge of having violated the above act.</p>
<p id="fbeb35df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The object of the [Fourteenth] amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either. Laws permitting, and even requiring, their separation, in places where they are liable to be brought into contact, do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other, and have been generally, if not universally, recognized as within the competency of the state legislatures in the exercise of their police power. The most common instance of this is connected with the establishment of separate schools for white and colored children, which have been held to be a valid exercise of the legislative power even by courts of states where the political rights of the <span title="730" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-730">p. 730</span>colored race have been longest and most earnestly enforced.

<p id="fbeb35e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it. The argument necessarily assumes that if, as has been more than once the case, and is not unlikely to be so again, the colored race should become the dominant power in the state legislature, and should enact a law in precisely similar terms, it would thereby relegate the white race to an inferior position. We imagine that the white race, at least, would not acquiesce in this assumption. The argument also assumes that social prejudices may be overcome by legislation, and that equal rights cannot be secured to the negro except by an enforced commingling of the two races. We cannot accept this proposition.</p>
<p id="fbeb5cf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality, it must be the result of natural affinities, a mutual appreciation of each other’s merits, and a voluntary consent of individuals. Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts, or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences, and the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the difficulties of the present situation. If the civil and political rights of both races be equal, one cannot be inferior to the other civilly or politically. If one race be inferior to the other socially, the constitution of the United States cannot put them upon the same plane.</p>

<p id="fbeb5cf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In respect of civil rights, common to all citizens, the constitution of the United States does not, I think, permit any public authority to know the race of those entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of such rights. Every true man has pride of race, and under appropriate circumstances, when the rights of others, his equals before the law, are not to be affected, it is his privilege to express such pride and to take such action based upon it as to him seems proper. But I deny that any legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race of citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved. Indeed, such legislation as that here in question is inconsistent not only with that equality of rights which pertains to citizenship, national and state, but with the personal liberty enjoyed by every one within the United States.</p>
<p id="fbeb5cf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was said in argument that the statute of Louisiana does not discriminate against either race, but prescribes a rule applicable alike to white and colored citizens. But this argument does not meet the difficulty. Every one knows that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons. Railroad corporations of Louisiana did not make discrimination among whites in the matter of accommodation for travelers. The thing to accomplish was, under the guise of giving equal accommodation for whites and blacks, to compel the latter to keep to themselves while traveling in railroad passenger coaches. No one would be so wanting in candor as to assert the contrary. If a white man and a black man choose to occupy the same public conveyance on a public highway, it is their <span title="731" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-731">p. 731</span>right to do so; and no government, proceeding alone on grounds of race, can prevent it without infringing the personal liberty of each.</p>
<p id="fbeb5cf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth, and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time, if it remains true to its great heritage, and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guarantied by the supreme law of the land are involved. It is therefore to be regretted that this high tribunal, the final expositor of the fundamental law of the land, has reached the conclusion that it is competent for a state to regulate the enjoyment by citizens of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race.</p>
<p id="fbeb5cf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion, the judgment this day rendered will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the <i>Dred Scott</i> case. The arbitrary separation of citizens, on the basis of race, while they are on a public highway, is a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the constitution. It cannot be justified upon any legal grounds. We boast of the freedom enjoyed by our people above all other peoples. But it is difficult to reconcile that boast with a state of the law which, practically, puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow-citizens, our equals before the law. The thin disguise of “equal” accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one, nor atone for the wrong this day done.</p>

In several subsequent cases, the Court reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson. “Separate but equal” was expressly approved in the realm of education. In Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education, 175 U.S. 528 (1899), the Court upheld the government’s operation of a high school open only for white students while none was available for blacks. The Court emphasized that local authorities were to be allowed great discretion in allocating funds between blacks and whites and that “any interference on the part of Federal authority with the management of such schools cannot be justified except in the case of a clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by the supreme law of the land.”</p>

Interestingly, most of these decisions involved the failure of states to provide equal opportunity for the legal education of blacks. The Court did not question the doctrine of separate but equal—instead it concluded that the lack of opportunities for blacks was unconstitutional.</p>

The Court explained that the “basic consideration is not as to what sort of opportunities other States provide, . . . but as to what opportunities Missouri itself furnishes to white students and denies to negroes solely upon the ground of color.” In response, Missouri did not admit blacks to its law school, but instead created a new law school for blacks.</p>

The University of Texas Law School had denied Heman Sweatt admission on the ground that he could attend the recently created Prairie View Law School. Although the Court was urged to reconsider Plessy v. Ferguson, it refused and instead found that the schools obviously were not equal. The University of Texas Law School had 16 full-time faculty members and substantial facilities. Prairie View Law School opened in 1947 with no full-time faculty and no library, though by the time the Court decided the case there were five full-time professors and a small library. The Court concluded, “[W]e cannot find substantial equality in the educational opportunities offered white and Negro law students by the State. . . . It is difficult to believe that one who had a free choice between these law schools would consider the question close.”</p>

They are premised on different facts and different local conditions, but a common legal question justifies their consideration together in this consolidated opinion. In each of the cases, minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, they have been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race. This <span title="734" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-734">p. 734</span>segregation was alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbebd145-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not “equal” and cannot be made “equal,” and that hence they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Argument was heard in the 1952 Term, and reargument was heard this Term on certain questions propounded by the Court. Reargument was largely devoted to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. It covered exhaustively consideration of the Amendment in Congress, ratification by the states, then existing practices in racial segregation, and the views of proponents and opponents of the Amendment. This discussion and our own investigation convince us that, although these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive. The most avid proponents of the post-War Amendments undoubtedly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.” Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter and the spirit of the Amendments and wished them to have the most limited effect. What others in Congress and the state legislatures had in mind cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.</p>
<p id="fbebd146-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional reason for the inconclusive nature of the Amendment’s history, with respect to segregated schools, is the status of public education at that time. In the South, the movement toward free common schools, supported by general taxation, had not yet taken hold. Education of white children was largely in the hands of private groups. Education of Negroes was almost nonexistent, and practically all of the race were illiterate. In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some states. Today, in contrast, many Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences as well as in the business and professional world. It is true that public school education at the time of the Amendment had advanced further in the North, but the effect of the Amendment on Northern States was generally ignored in the congressional debates. Even in the North, the conditions of public education did not approximate those existing today. The curriculum was usually rudimentary; ungraded schools were common in rural areas; the school term was but three months a year in many states; and compulsory school attendance was virtually unknown. As a consequence, it is not surprising that there should be so little in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment relating to its intended effect on public education.</p>
<p id="fbebd147-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words of the [Fourteenth] amendment, it is true, are prohibitory, but they contain a necessary implication of a positive immunity, or right, most valuable to the colored race,—the right to exemption from unfriendly legislation against them distinctively as colored,—exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and discriminations which are steps towards reducing them to the condition of a subject race.</p>
<p id="fbebd148-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant cases, that question is directly presented. Here, unlike Sweatt v. Painter, there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other “tangible” factors. Our decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the cases. We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.</p>

Ferguson was written. We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can it be determined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="fbebd14a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.</p>

Some argue that the Court erred by relying on social science studies to support its conclusion, rather than expressing a moral judgment that segregation was wrong.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A55_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A55_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">63</a></span> Indeed, Professor Mark Yudof argued that “[v]irtually everyone who has examined the question now agrees that the Court erred” in relying on the social science data.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A63_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A63_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">64</a></span> The concern is that the studies were “methodologically unsound” and that reliance on them made the decision vulnerable if future research came to differing conclusions.</p>

<p id="fbec1f79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others criticized <i>Brown</i> for focusing exclusively on education and thus failing to provide a basis for declaring segregation unconstitutional in other contexts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A8B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A8B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">65</a></span> Following <i>Brown</i>, in a series of <i>per curiam</i> opinions, the Supreme Court affirmed lower court decisions declaring unconstitutional state laws requiring segregation in all of the remaining areas of Southern life. For example, in Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877 (1955), the Supreme Court, in a memorandum disposition without an opinion, affirmed a lower court decision declaring unconstitutional a law requiring <span title="737" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-737">p. 737</span>segregation in the use of public beaches and bathhouses. The Court did the exact same thing in Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (1955), in declaring unconstitutional segregation of municipal golf courses; in Gayle v. Browder, 352 U.S. 903 (1956), in declaring unconstitutional the segregation of a municipal bus system; in Johnson v. Virginia, 373 U.S. 61 (1963), in declaring unconstitutional segregation of courtroom seating; and in Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350 (1962), in declaring unconstitutional segregation of public restaurants.</p>
<p id="fbec1f7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although these decisions, of course, reached the necessary result, the Court can be criticized for deciding without any opinion. The decision in <i>Brown</i> was based on the importance of education and the harms of segregation in that area. The unconstitutionality of segregation in beaches, golf courses, or buses required a separate explanation, one that the Court never offered.</p>
<p id="fbec1f7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, it is clearly established that laws requiring separation of the races are racial classifications that will be allowed only if strict scrutiny is met. In Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), the Court reaffirmed this in the context of prisons. Although courts usually give great deference to prisons, the Supreme Court held that routine racial segregation of prisoners must meet strict scrutiny. The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.</p>
<p id="fbec1f7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor wrote for the Court and noted that “the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are ‘[p]retty close’ to zero percent. The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group. Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics. The CDC’s asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.”</p>
<p id="fbec1f7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held that the CDC policy had to meet strict scrutiny:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbec468f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The CDC claims that its policy should be exempt from our categorical rule because it is “neutral”—that is, it “neither benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or individual.” In other words, strict scrutiny should not apply because all prisoners are “equally” segregated. The CDC’s argument ignores our repeated command that “racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.” Indeed, we rejected the notion that separate can ever be equal—or “neutral”—50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), and we refuse to resurrect it today.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbec4690-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here, where prison officials cite racial violence as the reason for their policy. As we have recognized in the past, racial classifications “threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.” Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible that prison officials will breed further hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions. By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates “may exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.”</p>
<p id="fbec4691-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the CDC’s policy is an express racial classification, it is “immediately suspect.” We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred when it failed to apply strict scrutiny to the CDC’s policy and to require the CDC to demonstrate that its policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.</p>
<p id="fbec4692-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the prison context, when the government’s power is at its apex, we think that searching judicial review of racial classifications is necessary to guard against invidious discrimination. Granting the CDC an exemption from the rule that strict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications would undermine our “unceasing <span title="738" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-738">p. 738</span>efforts to eradicate racial prejudice from our criminal justice system.” McCleskey v. Kemp (1987).</p>
<p id="fbec4693-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The CDC argues that “[d]eference to the particular expertise of prison officials in the difficult task of managing daily prison operations” requires a more relaxed standard of review for its segregation policy. But we have refused to defer to state officials’ judgments on race in other areas where those officials traditionally exercise substantial discretion.</p>
<p id="fbec4694-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that strict scrutiny applies “says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.” At this juncture, no such determination has been made. On remand, the CDC will have the burden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with regard to new inmates as well as transferees. Prisons are dangerous places, and the special circumstances they present may justify racial classifications in some contexts. Such circumstances can be considered in applying strict scrutiny, which is designed to take relevant differences into account.</p>
<p id="fbec4695-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not decide whether the CDC’s policy violates the Equal Protection Clause. We hold only that strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review and remand the case to allow the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or the District Court, to apply it in the first instance.</p>

The respondents Harley and Sellers <span title="739" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-739">p. 739</span>were permitted to intervene, their amended complaint asserting that their applications to become officers in the Department had been rejected, and that the Department’s recruiting procedures discriminated on the basis of race against black applicants by a series of practices including, but not limited to, a written personnel test which excluded a disproportionately high number of Negro applicants. These practices were asserted to violate respondents’ rights “under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbec6db5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the findings and conclusions of the District Court, to be accepted by the Department and to enter an intensive 17-week training program, the police recruit was required to satisfy certain physical and character standards, to be a high school graduate or its equivalent, and to receive a grade of at least 40 out of 80 on “Test 21,” which is “an examination that is used generally throughout the federal service,” which “was developed by the Civil Service Commission, not the Police Department,” and which was “designed to test verbal ability, vocabulary, reading and comprehension.”</p>
<p id="fbec94c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The validity of Test 21 was the sole issue before the court on the motions for summary judgment. The District Court noted that there was no claim of “an intentional discrimination or purposeful discriminatory acts” but only a claim that Test 21 bore no relationship to job performance and “has a highly discriminatory impact in screening out black candidates.” Respondents’ evidence, the District Court said, warranted three conclusions: “(a) The number of black police officers, while substantial, is not proportionate to the population mix of the city. (b) A higher percentage of blacks fail the Test than whites. (c) The Test has not been validated to establish its reliability for measuring subsequent job performance.” This showing was deemed sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the defendants in the action, petitioners here; but the court nevertheless concluded that on the undisputed facts respondents were not entitled to relief.</p>

<p id="fbec94c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race. But our cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact.</p>
<p id="fbec94c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that the necessary discriminatory racial purpose must be express or appear on the face of the statute, or that a law’s disproportionate impact is irrelevant in cases involving Constitution-based claims of racial discrimination. A statute, otherwise neutral on its face, must not be applied so as invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race. Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886).</p>
<p id="fbec94ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Necessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another. Nevertheless, we have not held that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another. Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution. Standing alone, it does not trigger <span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>the rule, that racial classifications are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny and are justifiable only by the weightiest of considerations.</p>
<p id="fbec94cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are some indications to the contrary in our cases. In Palmer v. Thompson (1971), the city of Jackson, Miss., following a court decree to this effect, desegregated all of its public facilities save five swimming pools which had been operated by the city and which, following the decree, were closed by ordinance pursuant to a determination by the city council that closure was necessary to preserve peace and order and that integrated pools could not be economically operated. Accepting the finding that the pools were closed to avoid violence and economic loss, this Court rejected the argument that the abandonment of this service was inconsistent with the outstanding desegregation decree and that the otherwise seemingly permissible ends served by the ordinance could be impeached by demonstrating that racially invidious motivations had prompted the city council’s action. The holding was that the city was not overtly or covertly operating segregated pools and was extending identical treatment to both whites and Negroes. The opinion warned against grounding decision on legislative purpose or motivation, thereby lending support for the proposition that the operative effect of the law rather than its purpose is the paramount factor. But the holding of the case was that the legitimate purposes of the ordinance to preserve peace and avoid deficits were not open to impeachment by evidence that the councilmen were actually motivated by racial considerations. Whatever dicta the opinion may contain, the decision did not involve, much less invalidate, a statute or ordinance having neutral purposes but disproportionate racial consequences.</p>
<p id="fbec94cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an initial matter, we have difficulty understanding how a law establishing a racially neutral qualification for employment is nevertheless racially discriminatory and denies “any person . . . equal protection of the laws” simply because a greater proportion of Negroes fail to qualify than members of other racial or ethnic groups. Test 21, which is administered generally to prospective Government employees, concededly seeks to ascertain whether those who take it have acquired a particular level of verbal skill; and it is untenable that the Constitution prevents the Government from seeking modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees rather than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special ability to communicate orally and in writing. Respondents, as Negroes, could no more successfully claim that the test denied them equal protection than could white applicants who also failed. The conclusion would not be different in the face of proof that more Negroes than whites had been disqualified by Test 21. That other Negroes also failed to score well would, alone, not demonstrate that respondents individually were being denied equal protection of the laws by the application of an otherwise valid qualifying test being administered to prospective police recruits.</p>
<p id="fbec94cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor on the facts of the case before us would the disproportionate impact of Test 21 warrant the conclusion that it is a purposeful device to discriminate against Negroes and hence an infringement of the constitutional rights of respondents as well as other black applicants. As we have said, the test is neutral on its face and rationally may be said to serve a purpose the Government is constitutionally empowered to pursue.</p>
<p id="fbec94ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Title VII, Congress provided that when hiring and promotion practices disqualifying substantially disproportionate numbers of blacks are <span title="741" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-741">p. 741</span>challenged, discriminatory purpose need not be proved, and that it is an insufficient response to demonstrate some rational basis for the challenged practices. It is necessary, in addition, that they be “validated” in terms of job performance in any one of several ways, perhaps by ascertaining the minimum skill, ability, or potential necessary for the position at issue and determining whether the qualifying tests are appropriate for the selection of qualified applicants for the job in question. We are not disposed to adopt this more rigorous standard for the purposes of applying the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments in cases such as this.</p>
<p id="fbec94cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid, absent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be far-reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.</p>

<p id="fbec94d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t should be observed that every federal court, except the District Court in this case, presented with proof identical to that offered to validate Test 21 has reached a conclusion directly opposite to that of the Court today. Sound policy considerations support the view that, at a minimum, petitioners should have been required to prove that the police training examinations either measure job-related skills or predict job performance. Where employers try to validate written qualification tests by proving a correlation with written examinations in a training course, there is a substantial danger that people who have good verbal skills will achieve high scores on both tests due to verbal ability, rather than “job-specific ability.” As a result, employers could validate any entrance examination that measures only verbal ability by giving another written test that measures verbal ability at the end of a training course. Any contention that the resulting correlation between examination scores would be evidence that the initial test is “job related” is plainly erroneous. It seems to me, however, that the Court’s holding in this case can be read as endorsing this dubious proposition. Today’s result will prove particularly unfortunate if it is extended to govern Title VII cases.</p>

The evidence at trial indicated that McCleskey and three accomplices planned and carried out the robbery. All four were armed. McCleskey entered the front of the store while the other three entered the rear. McCleskey secured the front of the store by rounding up the customers and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. The other three rounded up the employees in the rear and tied them up with tape. The manager was forced at gunpoint to turn over the store receipts, his watch, and $6. During the course of the robbery, a police officer, answering a silent alarm, entered the store through the front door. As he was walking down the center aisle of the store, two shots were fired. Both struck the officer. One hit him in the face and killed him.</p>
<p id="fbece2fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several weeks later, McCleskey was arrested in connection with an unrelated offense. He confessed that he had participated in the furniture store robbery, but denied that he had shot the police officer. At trial, the State introduced evidence that at least one of the bullets that struck the officer was fired from a .38 caliber Rossi revolver. This description matched the description of the gun that McCleskey had carried during the robbery. The State also introduced the testimony of two witnesses who had heard McCleskey admit to the shooting.</p>
<p id="fbece2ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury convicted McCleskey of murder. At the penalty hearing, the jury heard arguments as to the appropriate sentence. Under Georgia law, the jury could not consider imposing the death penalty unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was accompanied by one of the statutory aggravating circumstances. The jury in this case found two aggravating circumstances to exist beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a peace officer engaged in the performance of his duties. In making its decision whether to impose the death sentence, the jury considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of McCleskey’s conduct. McCleskey offered no mitigating evidence. The jury recommended that he be sentenced to death on the murder charge and to consecutive life sentences on the armed robbery charges. The court followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced McCleskey to death.</p>
<p id="fbece300-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="743" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-743">p. 743</span>McCleskey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. His petition raised 18 claims, one of which was that the Georgia capital sentencing process is administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In support of his claim, McCleskey proffered a statistical study performed by Professors David C. Baldus, Charles Pulaski, and George Woodworth, and (the Baldus study) that purports to show a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the race of the murder victim and, to a lesser extent, the race of the defendant. The Baldus study is actually two sophisticated statistical studies that examine over 2,000 murder cases that occurred in Georgia during the 1970’s. The raw numbers collected by Professor Baldus indicate that defendants charged with killing white persons received the death penalty in 11% of the cases, but defendants charged with killing blacks received the death penalty in only 1% of the cases. The raw numbers also indicate a reverse racial disparity according to the race of the defendant: 4% of the black defendants received the death penalty, as opposed to 7% of the white defendants.</p>
<p id="fbece301-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Baldus also divided the cases according to the combination of the race of the defendant and the race of the victim. He found that the death penalty was assessed in 22% of the cases involving black defendants and white victims; 8% of the cases involving white defendants and white victims; 1% of the cases involving black defendants and black victims; and 3% of the cases involving white defendants and black victims. Similarly, Baldus found that prosecutors sought the death penalty in 70% of the cases involving black defendants and white victims; 32% of the cases involving white defendants and white victims; 15% of the cases involving black defendants and black victims; and 19% of the cases involving white defendants and black victims.</p>
<p id="fbece302-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Baldus subjected his data to an extensive analysis, taking account of 230 variables that could have explained the disparities on nonracial grounds. One of his models concludes that, even after taking account of 39 nonracial variables, defendants charged with killing white victims were 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence as defendants charged with killing blacks. According to this model, black defendants were 1.1 times as likely to receive a death sentence as other defendants. Thus, the Baldus study indicates that black defendants, such as McCleskey, who kill white victims have the greatest likelihood of receiving the death penalty.</p>

<p id="fbece304-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey’s first claim is that the Georgia capital punishment statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He argues that race has infected the administration of Georgia’s statute in two ways: persons who murder whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than persons who murder blacks, and black murderers are more likely to be sentenced to death than white murderers. As a black defendant who killed a white victim, McCleskey claims that the Baldus study demonstrates that he was discriminated against because of his race and because of the race of his victim. In its broadest form, McCleskey’s claim of discrimination extends to every actor in the Georgia capital sentencing process, from the prosecutor who sought the death penalty <span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-744">p. 744</span>and the jury that imposed the sentence, to the State itself that enacted the capital punishment statute and allows it to remain in effect despite its allegedly discriminatory application. We agree with the Court of Appeals, and every other court that has considered such a challenge, that this claim must fail.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbece305-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fbece306-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving “the existence of purposeful discrimination.” A corollary to this principle is that a criminal defendant must prove that the purposeful discrimination “had a discriminatory effect” on him. Thus, to prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, McCleskey must prove that the decision-makers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose. He offers no evidence specific to his own case that would support an inference that racial considerations played a part in his sentence. Instead, he relies solely on the Baldus study. McCleskey argues that the Baldus study compels an inference that his sentence rests on purposeful discrimination. McCleskey’s claim that these statistics are sufficient proof of discrimination, without regard to the facts of a particular case, would extend to all capital cases in Georgia, at least where the victim was white and the defendant is black.</p>
<p id="fbece307-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[E]ach particular decision to impose the death penalty is made by a petit jury selected from a properly constituted venire. Each jury is unique in its composition, and the Constitution requires that its decision rest on consideration of innumerable factors that vary according to the characteristics of the individual defendant and the facts of the particular capital offense. Similarly, the policy considerations behind a prosecutor’s traditionally “wide discretion” suggest the impropriety of our requiring prosecutors to defend their decisions to seek death penalties, “often years after they were made.” Moreover, absent far stronger proof, it is unnecessary to seek such a rebuttal, because a legitimate and unchallenged explanation for the decision is apparent from the record: McCleskey committed an act for which the United States Constitution and Georgia laws permit imposition of the death penalty.</p>
<p id="fbed0a18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, McCleskey’s statistical proffer must be viewed in the context of his challenge. McCleskey challenges decisions at the heart of the State’s criminal justice system. “[O]ne of society’s most basic tasks is that of protecting the lives of its citizens and one of the most basic ways in which it achieves the task is through criminal laws against murder.” Gregg v. Georgia (1976) (White, J., concurring). Implementation of these laws necessarily requires discretionary judgments. Because discretion is essential to the criminal justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we would infer that the discretion has been abused. The unique nature of the decisions at issue in this case also counsels against adopting such an inference from the disparities indicated by the Baldus study. Accordingly, we hold that the Baldus study is clearly insufficient to support an inference that any of the decision-makers in McCleskey’s case acted with discriminatory purpose.</p>

<p id="fbed0a1a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey also suggests that the Baldus study proves that the State as a whole has acted with a discriminatory purpose. He appears to argue that the State has violated the Equal Protection Clause by adopting the capital punishment statute and allowing it to remain in force despite its allegedly discriminatory <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>application. But “‘[d]iscriminatory purpose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney (1979). For this claim to prevail, McCleskey would have to prove that the Georgia Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute because of an anticipated racially discriminatory effect. In Gregg v. Georgia, this Court found that the Georgia capital sentencing system could operate in a fair and neutral manner. There was no evidence then, and there is none now, that the Georgia Legislature enacted the capital punishment statute to further a racially discriminatory purpose.</p>
<p id="fbed0a1b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor has McCleskey demonstrated that the legislature maintains the capital punishment statute because of the racially disproportionate impact suggested by the Baldus study. As legislatures necessarily have wide discretion in the choice of criminal laws and penalties, and as there were legitimate reasons for the Georgia Legislature to adopt and maintain capital punishment, we will not infer a discriminatory purpose on the part of the State of Georgia. Accordingly, we reject McCleskey’s equal protection claims.</p>
<p id="fbed0a1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> joins, and with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbed0a1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At some point in this case, Warren McCleskey doubtless asked his lawyer whether a jury was likely to sentence him to die. A candid reply to this question would have been disturbing. First, counsel would have to tell McCleskey that few of the details of the crime or of McCleskey’s past criminal conduct were more important than the fact that his victim was white. Furthermore, counsel would feel bound to tell McCleskey that defendants charged with killing white victims in Georgia are 4.3 times as likely to be sentenced to death as defendants charged with killing blacks. In addition, frankness would compel the disclosure that it was more likely than not that the race of McCleskey’s victim would determine whether he received a death sentence: 6 of every 11 defendants convicted of killing a white person would not have received the death penalty if their victims had been black, while, among defendants with aggravating and mitigating factors comparable to McCleskey’s, 20 of every 34 would not have been sentenced to die if their victims had been black. Finally, the assessment would not be complete without the information that cases involving black defendants and white victims are more likely to result in a death sentence than cases featuring any other racial combination of defendant and victim. Ibid. The story could be told in a variety of ways, but McCleskey could not fail to grasp its essential narrative line: there was a significant chance that race would play a prominent role in determining if he lived or died.</p>
<p id="fbed0a1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, even examination of the sentencing system as a whole, factoring in those cases in which the jury exercises little discretion, indicates the influence of race on capital sentencing. For the Georgia system as a whole, race accounts for a six percentage point difference in the rate at which capital punishment is imposed. Since death is imposed in 11% of all white-victim cases, the rate in comparably aggravated black-victim cases is 5%. The rate of capital sentencing in a white-victim case is thus 120% greater than the rate in a black-victim case. Put another way, over half—55%—of defendants in white-victim <span title="746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-746">p. 746</span>crimes in Georgia would not have been sentenced to die if their victims had been black. Of the more than 200 variables potentially relevant to a sentencing decision, race of the victim is a powerful explanation for variation in death sentence rates—as powerful as non-racial aggravating factors such as a prior murder conviction or acting as the principal planner of the homicide.</p>
<p id="fbed0a1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These adjusted figures are only the most conservative indication of the risk that race will influence the death sentences of defendants in Georgia. Data unadjusted for the mitigating or aggravating effect of other factors show an even more pronounced disparity by race. The capital sentencing rate for all white-victim cases was almost 11 times greater than the rate for black-victim cases. Furthermore, blacks who kill whites are sentenced to death at nearly 22 times the rate of blacks who kill blacks, and more than 7 times the rate of whites who kill blacks. In addition, prosecutors seek the death penalty for 70% of black defendants with white victims, but for only 15% of black defendants with black victims, and only 19% of white defendants with black victims. Since our decision upholding the Georgia capital sentencing system in <i>Gregg</i>, the State has executed seven persons. All of the seven were convicted of killing whites, and six of the seven executed were black. Such execution figures are especially striking in light of the fact that, during the period encompassed by the Baldus study, only 9.2% of Georgia homicides involved black defendants and white victims, while 60.7% involved black victims.</p>
<p id="fbed0a20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statistical evidence in this case thus relentlessly documents the risk that McCleskey’s sentence was influenced by racial considerations. This evidence shows that there is a better than even chance in Georgia that race will influence the decision to impose the death penalty: a majority of defendants in white-victim crimes would not have been sentenced to die if their victims had been black.</p>
<p id="fbed0a21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evaluation of McCleskey’s evidence cannot rest solely on the numbers themselves. We must also ask whether the conclusion suggested by those numbers is consonant with our understanding of history and human experience. Georgia’s legacy of a race-conscious criminal justice system, as well as this Court’s own recognition of the persistent danger that racial attitudes may affect criminal proceedings, indicates that McCleskey’s claim is not a fanciful product of mere statistical artifice.</p>
<p id="fbed0a22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For many years, Georgia operated openly and formally precisely the type of dual system the evidence shows is still effectively in place. The criminal law expressly differentiated between crimes committed by and against blacks and whites, distinctions whose lineage traced back to the time of slavery. During the colonial period, black slaves who killed whites in Georgia, regardless of whether in self-defense or in defense of another, were automatically executed. By the time of the Civil War, a dual system of crime and punishment was well established in Georgia.</p>
<p id="fbed0a23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has invalidated portions of the Georgia capital sentencing system three times over the past 15 years. The specter of race discrimination was acknowledged by the Court in striking down the Georgia death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia. Justice Douglas cited studies suggesting imposition of the death penalty in racially discriminatory fashion, and found the standardless statutes before the Court “pregnant with discrimination.”</p>
<p id="fbed3134-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This historical review of Georgia criminal law is not intended as a bill of indictment calling the State to account for past transgressions. Citation of past <span title="747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-747">p. 747</span>practices does not justify the automatic condemnation of current ones. But it would be unrealistic to ignore the influence of history in assessing the plausible implications of McCleskey’s evidence.</p>
<p id="fbed3135-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discretion afforded prosecutors and jurors in the Georgia capital sentencing system creates such opportunities. No guidelines govern prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty, and Georgia provides juries with no list of aggravating and mitigating factors, nor any standard for balancing them against one another. Once a jury identifies one aggravating factor, it has complete discretion in choosing life or death, and need not articulate its basis for selecting life imprisonment. The Georgia sentencing system therefore provides considerable opportunity for racial considerations, however subtle and unconscious, to influence charging and sentencing decisions.</p>
<p id="fbed3136-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Warren McCleskey’s evidence confronts us with the subtle and persistent influence of the past. His message is a disturbing one to a society that has formally repudiated racism, and a frustrating one to a Nation accustomed to regarding its destiny as the product of its own will. Nonetheless, we ignore him at our peril, for we remain imprisoned by the past as long as we deny its influence in the present.</p>
<p id="fbed3137-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is tempting to pretend that minorities on death row share a fate in no way connected to our own, that our treatment of them sounds no echoes beyond the chambers in which they die. Such an illusion is ultimately corrosive, for the reverberations of injustice are not so easily confined. “The destinies of the two races in this country are indissolubly linked together,” Plessy v. Ferguson (Harlan, J., dissenting), and the way in which we choose those who will die reveals the depth of moral commitment among the living.</p>
<p id="fbed3138-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decision today will not change what attorneys in Georgia tell other Warren McCleskeys about their chances of execution. Nothing will soften the harsh message they must convey, nor alter the prospect that race undoubtedly will continue to be a topic of discussion. McCleskey’s evidence will not have obtained judicial acceptance, but that will not affect what is said on death row. However many criticisms of today’s decision may be rendered, these painful conversations will serve as the most eloquent dissents of all.</p>

<p id="fbed3139-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether discrimination can be proven by showing a discriminatory impact is crucial in determining the reach of the Equal Protection Clause. Undoubtedly, there are many areas where a significant discriminatory impact can be proven, but there is not sufficient evidence of a discriminatory purpose. Current law means that the government need not offer a racially neutral explanation for these effects and, indeed, need do no more than meet a rational basis test.</p>
<p id="fbed313a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the one hand, this can be justified by the view that the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with stopping discriminatory acts by the government, not in bringing about equal results. Moreover, there is concern that countless laws might have some discriminatory impact given the enormous inequalities between whites and racial minorities that continue to exist. Also it is argued that there will be laws that have the impact of benefiting minorities and that these can counterbalance those that have a detrimental effect.</p>
<p id="fbed313b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, as discussed below, proving discriminatory purpose is very difficult; rarely will such a motivation be expressed and benign purposes <span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span>can be articulated for most laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C56_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C56_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">67</a></span> Therefore, many laws with both a discriminatory purpose and effect might be upheld simply because of evidentiary problems inherent in requiring proof of such a purpose. Scholars such as Professor Charles Lawrence argue that this is especially true because racism is often unconscious and such “unconscious racism . . . underlies much of the racially disproportionate impact of governmental policy.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C61_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C61_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">68</a></span> In a society with a long history of discrimination, there can be a presumption that many laws with a discriminatory impact likely were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C6A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C6A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">69</a></span></p>
<p id="fbed313f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, it is argued that equal protection should be concerned with the results of government actions and not just their underlying motivations. Professor Lawrence Tribe explained, “The goal of the Equal Protection Clause is not to stamp out impure thoughts, but to guarantee a full measure of human dignity for all. . . . [M]inorities can also be injured when the government is ‘only’ indifferent to their suffering or ‘merely’ blind to how prior official discrimination contributed to it and how current official acts will perpetuate it.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C78_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C78_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">70</a></span></p>

The three Commissioners jointly exercise all legislative, executive and administrative power in the municipality. They are required after election to designate one of their number as Mayor, a largely ceremonial office, but no formal provision is made for allocating specific executive or administrative duties among the three. As required by the state law enacted in 1911, each candidate for the Mobile City Commission runs for election in the city at large for a term of four years in one of three numbered posts, and may be elected only by a majority of the total vote.

The Court’s more recent decisions confirm the principle that racially discriminatory motivation is a necessary ingredient of a Fifteenth Amendment violation. In Gomillion v. Lightfoot the Court held that allegations of a racially motivated gerrymander of municipal boundaries stated a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment. The constitutional infirmity of the state law in that case, according to the allegations of the complaint, was that in drawing the municipal boundaries the legislature was “solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.” The Court made clear that in the absence of such an invidious purpose, a State is constitutionally free to redraw political boundaries in any manner it chooses. While other of the Court’s Fifteenth Amendment decisions have dealt with different issues, none has questioned the necessity of showing purposeful discrimination in order to show a Fifteenth Amendment violation.</p>
<p id="fbed585d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite repeated constitutional attacks upon multimember legislative districts, the Court has consistently held that they are not unconstitutional per se. We have recognized, however, that such legislative apportionments could violate the Fourteenth Amendment if their purpose were invidiously to minimize or cancel out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities. To prove such a purpose it is not enough to show that the group allegedly discriminated against has not elected representatives in proportion to its numbers. A plaintiff must prove that the disputed plan was “conceived or operated as [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination.” This burden of proof is simply one aspect of the basic principle that only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Washington v. Davis.</p>
<p id="fbed585e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he [district court and the court of appeals] found it highly significant that no Negro had been elected to the Mobile City Commission. From this fact they concluded that the processes leading to nomination and election were not open equally to Negroes. But the District Court’s findings of fact, unquestioned on appeal, make clear that Negroes register and vote in Mobile “without hindrance,” and that there are no official obstacles in the way of Negroes who wish to become candidates for election to the Commission. Indeed, it was undisputed that the only active “slating” organization in the city is comprised of Negroes. It may be that Negro candidates have been defeated but that fact alone does not work a constitutional deprivation.</p>
<p id="fbed585f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="750" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-750">p. 750</span>Second, the District Court relied in part on its finding that the persons who were elected to the Commission discriminated against Negroes in municipal employment and in dispensing public services. If that is the case, those discriminated against may be entitled to relief under the Constitution, albeit of a sort quite different from that sought in the present case. But evidence of discrimination by white officials in Mobile is relevant only as the most tenuous and circumstantial evidence of the constitutional invalidity of the electoral system under which they attained their offices.</p>
<p id="fbed5860-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the District Court and the Court of Appeals supported their conclusion by drawing upon the substantial history of official racial discrimination in Alabama. But past discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful. The ultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case. More distant instances of official discrimination in other cases are of limited help in resolving that question.</p>
<p id="fbed5861-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the District Court and the Court of Appeals pointed to the mechanics of the at-large electoral system itself as proof that the votes of Negroes were being invidiously canceled out. But those features of that electoral system, such as the majority vote requirement, tend naturally to disadvantage any voting minority. They are far from proof that the at-large electoral scheme represents purposeful discrimination against Negro voters.</p>

<p id="fbed5863-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals properly found that an invidious discriminatory purpose could be inferred from the totality of facts in this case. The Court’s cryptic rejection of their conclusions ignores the principles that an invidious discriminatory purpose can be inferred from objective factors and that the trial courts are in a special position to make such intensely local appraisals.</p>
<p id="fbed7f74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case the District Court and the Court of Appeals faithfully applied [constitutional] principles in assessing whether the maintenance of a system of at-large elections for the selection of Mobile City Commissioners denied Mobile Negroes their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights. Scrupulously adhering to our admonition that “[t]he plaintiffs’ burden is to produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election were not equally open to participation by the group in question,” the District Court conducted a detailed factual inquiry into the openness of the candidate selection process to blacks.</p>
<p id="fbed7f75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court noted that “Mobile blacks were subjected to massive official and private racial discrimination until the Voting Rights Act of 1965” and that “[t]he pervasive effects of past discrimination still substantially affec[t] black political participation.” Although the District Court noted that “[s]ince the Voting Rights Act of 1965, blacks register and vote without hindrance,” the court found that “local political processes are not equally open” to blacks. Despite the fact that Negroes constitute more than 35% of the population of Mobile, no Negro has ever been elected to the Mobile City Commission. The plaintiffs introduced extensive evidence of severe racial polarization in voting patterns during the 1960s and 1970s with “white voting for white and black for black if a white is opposed to a black,” resulting in the defeat of the black candidate or, if <span title="751" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-751">p. 751</span>two whites are running, the defeat of the white candidate most identified with blacks. Nearly every active candidate for public office testified that because of racial polarization “it is highly unlikely that anytime in the foreseeable future, under the at-large system, . . . a black can be elected against a white.” After single-member districts were created in Mobile County for state legislative elections, “three blacks of the present fourteen member Mobile County delegation have been elected.” Based on the foregoing evidence, the District Court found “that the structure of the at-large election of city commissioners combined with strong racial polarization of Mobile’s electorate continues to effectively discourage qualified black citizens from seeking office or being elected thereby denying blacks equal access to the slating or candidate selection process.” Because I believe that the findings of the District Court amply support an inference of purposeful discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fbed7f76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Soon after <i>Mobile</i>, in Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613 (1982), the Court found that an at-large election system was unconstitutional because there was sufficient proof of a discriminatory purpose behind the election system. <i>Rogers</i> involved a challenge to an at-large election scheme for a large rural county in Georgia. The district court found that the “at-large system in Burke County was being maintained for the invidious purpose of diluting the voting strength of the black population.”</p>
<p id="fbed7f77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court upheld this factual finding, emphasizing that blacks were a substantial majority of the population in the county but a distinct minority of the registered voters. The Court also noted that no black ever had been elected to the county commission. The Court pointed to a long history of purposeful discrimination against blacks in voting in the county, including the use of poll taxes, literacy tests, and white primaries. Furthermore, schools within the county were racially segregated until 1969 and still remained largely segregated. The Court additionally observed that blacks had been excluded from participating in the political process, in party affairs, and in primary elections. All of these factors justified the conclusion that there was a discriminatory purpose behind the at-large election system.</p>
<p id="fbed7f78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mobile v. Bolden and Rogers v. Lodge are consistent in that both clearly say that proof of a discriminatory purpose is required in order to challenge an at-large election scheme. But the key question is whether there is a meaningful factual distinction between the cases. Both involve Southern cities with a long history of overt racial discrimination, including in voting. In neither had a black ever been elected. But the Court saw a meaningful difference in the proof offered in the two cases and found only sufficient evidence of discriminatory purpose in the latter.</p>
<p id="fbed7f79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 largely obviated the need to distinguish the two cases and to discern what sufficiently establishes discriminatory purpose. The amendment was in response to Mobile v. Bolden and prohibits election systems that dilute the voting power of a racial minority. In other words, the 1982 Amendments eliminate the need for proof of discriminatory purpose in challenging an election system as being racially discriminatory.</p>

<p id="fbed7f7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases discussed thus far involve situations where there is proof of a racially discriminatory impact of a facially neutral law. A distinct question that arises much less often is whether proof of discriminatory purpose is sufficient, by itself, to establish an equal protection violation or whether there must be both discriminatory impact and discriminatory purpose. This issue arises far less frequently because usually there is evidence of a discriminatory impact and the question is whether there is adequate proof of discriminatory purpose. Although the Supreme Court has never expressly addressed the question, it appears that both are required. Palmer v. Thompson is the case that indicates that discriminatory impact also must be shown; indeed, in Washington v. Davis, above, it was cited as standing for that proposition.</p>

<p id="fbed7f82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Black</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbed7f83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1962 the city of Jackson, Mississippi, was maintaining five public parks along with swimming pools, golf links, and other facilities for use by the public on a racially segregated basis. Four of the swimming pools were used by whites only and one by Negroes only. Plaintiffs brought an action in the United States District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that this state-enforced segregation of the races was a violation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, and asking an injunction to forbid such practices. After hearings the District Court entered a judgment declaring that enforced segregation denied equal protection of the laws but it declined to issue an injunction. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. The city proceeded to desegregate its public parks, auditoriums, golf courses, and the city zoo. However, the city council decided not to try to operate the public swimming pools on a desegregated basis. Acting in its legislative capacity, the council surrendered its lease on one pool and closed four which the city owned. A number of Negro citizens of Jackson then filed this suit to force the city to reopen the pools and operate them on a desegregated basis.</p>
<p id="fbed7f84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question, however, is whether this closing of the pools is state action that denies “the equal protection of the laws” to Negroes. It should be noted first that neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any Act of Congress purports to impose an affirmative duty on a State to begin to operate or to continue to operate swimming pools. Furthermore, this is not a case where whites are permitted to use public facilities while blacks are denied access. It is not a case where a city is maintaining different sets of facilities for blacks and whites and forcing the races to remain separate in recreational or educational activities.</p>
<p id="fbed7f85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners have also argued that respondents’ action violates the Equal Protection Clause because the decision to close the pools was motivated by a desire to avoid integration of the races. But no case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for it.</p>
<p id="fbeda696-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it is extremely difficult for a court to ascertain the motivation, or collection of different motivations, that lie behind a legislative enactment. Here, for <span title="753" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-753">p. 753</span>example, petitioners have argued that the Jackson pools were closed because of ideological opposition to racial integration in swimming pools. Some evidence in the record appears to support this argument. On the other hand the courts below found that the pools were closed because the city council felt they could not be operated safely and economically on an integrated basis. There is substantial evidence in the record to support this conclusion. It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the “sole” or “dominant” motivation behind the choices of a group of legislators. Furthermore, there is an element of futility in a judicial attempt to invalidate a law because of the bad motives of its supporters. If the law is struck down for this reason, rather than because of its facial content or effect, it would presumably be valid as soon as the legislature or relevant governing body repassed it for different reasons.</p>
<p id="fbeda697-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners have argued strenuously that a city’s possible motivations to ensure safety and save money cannot validate an otherwise impermissible state action. This proposition is, of course, true. Citizens may not be compelled to forgo their constitutional rights because officials fear public hostility or desire to save money. But the issue here is whether black citizens in Jackson are being denied their constitutional rights when the city has closed the public pools to black and white alike. Nothing in the history or the language of the Fourteenth Amendment nor in any of our prior cases persuades us that the closing of the Jackson swimming pools to all its citizens constitutes a denial of “the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fbeda698-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has not been so many years since it was first deemed proper and lawful for cities to tax their citizens to build and operate swimming pools for the public. Probably few persons, prior to this case, would have imagined that cities could be forced by five lifetime judges to construct or refurbish swimming pools which they choose not to operate for any reason, sound or unsound. Should citizens of Jackson or any other city be able to establish in court that public, tax-supported swimming pools are being denied to one group because of color and supplied to another, they will be entitled to relief. But that is not the case here.</p>
<p id="fbeda699-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbeda69a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">May a State in order to avoid integration of the races abolish all of its public schools? That would dedicate the State to backwardness, ignorance, and existence in a new Dark Age. Yet is there anything in the Constitution that says that a State must have a public school system? Could a federal court enjoin the dismantling of a public school system? Could a federal court order a city to levy the taxes necessary to construct a public school system? Such supervision over municipal affairs by federal courts would be a vast undertaking, conceivably encompassing schools, parks, playgrounds, civic auditoriums, tennis courts, athletic fields, as well as swimming pools.</p>
<p id="fbeda69b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Closing of the pools probably works a greater hardship on the poor than on the rich; and it may work greater hardship on poor Negroes than on poor whites, a matter on which we have no light. Closing of the pools was at least in part racially motivated. And, as stated by the dissenters in the Court of Appeals:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbeda69c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The closing of the City’s pools has done more than deprive a few thousand Negroes of the pleasures of swimming. It has taught Jackson’s Negroes a lesson: In Jackson the price of protest is high. Negroes there now know that they risk losing even <span title="754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-754">p. 754</span>segregated public facilities if they dare to protest segregation. Negroes will now think twice before protesting segregated public parks, segregated public libraries, or other segregated facilities. They must first decide whether they wish to risk living without the facility altogether, and at the same time engendering further animosity from a white community which has lost its public facilities also through the Negroes’ attempts to desegregate these facilities.</p>

<p id="fbeda69d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I conclude that though a State may discontinue any of its municipal services—such as schools, parks, pools, athletic fields, and the like—it may not do so for the purpose of perpetuating or installing apartheid or because it finds life in a multiracial community difficult or unpleasant. If that is its reason, then abolition of a designated public service becomes a device for perpetuating a segregated way of life. That a State may not do.</p>

<p id="fbeda6a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crucial question then becomes: How can it be proven that a facially neutral law is motivated by a discriminatory purpose? The Supreme Court has made it clear that showing such a purpose requires proof that the government desired to discriminate; it is not enough to prove that the government took an action with knowledge that it would have discriminatory consequences. In Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, a case dealing with gender discrimination, the Court chose a narrow definition of what constitutes discriminatory intent.</p>

<p id="fbedcdb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents a challenge to the constitutionality of the Massachusetts veterans’ preference statute, on the ground that it discriminates against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under ch. 31, §23, all veterans who qualify for state civil service positions must be considered for appointment ahead of any qualifying nonveterans. The preference operates overwhelmingly to the advantage of males.</p>
<p id="fbedcdb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that the absolute preference afforded by Massachusetts to veterans has a devastating impact upon the employment opportunities of women. Although it found that the goals of the preference were worthy and legitimate and that the legislation had not been enacted for the purpose of discriminating against women, the court reasoned that its exclusionary impact upon women was nonetheless so severe as to require the State to further its goals through a more limited form of preference. Finding that a more modest preference formula would readily accommodate the State’s interest in aiding veterans, the court declared ch. 31, §23, unconstitutional and enjoined its operation.</p>
<p id="fbedcdb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The veterans’ hiring preference in Massachusetts, as in other jurisdictions, has traditionally been justified as a measure designed to reward veterans for the sacrifice of military service, to ease the transition from military to civilian life, to <span title="755" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-755">p. 755</span>encourage patriotic service, and to attract loyal and well-disciplined people to civil service occupations.</p>
<p id="fbedcdba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding the apparent attempts by Massachusetts to include as many military women as possible within the scope of the preference, the statute today benefits an overwhelmingly male class. This is attributable in some measure to the variety of federal statutes, regulations, and policies that have restricted the number of women who could enlist in the United States Armed Forces, and largely to the simple fact that women have never been subjected to a military draft. When this litigation was commenced, then, over 98% of the veterans in Massachusetts were male; only 1.8% were female. And over one-quarter of the Massachusetts population were veterans.</p>
<p id="fbedcdbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispositive question, then, is whether the appellee has shown that a gender-based discriminatory purpose has, at least in some measure, shaped the Massachusetts veterans’ preference legislation. The appellee’s ultimate argument rests upon the presumption, common to the criminal and civil law, that a person intends the natural and foreseeable consequences of his voluntary actions. Her position was well stated in the concurring opinion in the District Court:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbedcdbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conceding . . . that the goal here was to benefit the veteran, there is no reason to absolve the legislature from awareness that the means chosen to achieve this goal would freeze women out of all those state jobs actively sought by men. To be sure, the legislature did not wish to harm women. But the cutting-off of women’s opportunities was an inevitable concomitant of the chosen scheme—as inevitable as the proposition that if tails is up, heads must be down. Where a law’s consequences are that inevitable, can they meaningfully be described as unintended?</p>
</div>
<p id="fbedcdbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rhetorical question implies that a negative answer is obvious, but it is not. The decision to grant a preference to veterans was of course “intentional.” So, necessarily, did an adverse impact upon nonveterans follow from that decision. And it cannot seriously be argued that the Legislature of Massachusetts could have been unaware that most veterans are men. It would thus be disingenuous to say that the adverse consequences of this legislation for women were unintended, in the sense that they were not volitional or in the sense that they were not foreseeable.</p>
<p id="fbedcdbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">”Discriminatory purpose,” however, implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part “because of,” not merely “in spite of,” its adverse effects upon an identifiable group. Yet, nothing in the record demonstrates that this preference for veterans was originally devised or subsequently re-enacted because it would accomplish the collateral goal of keeping women in a stereotypic and predefined place in the Massachusetts Civil Service.</p>
<p id="fbedcdbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the contrary, the statutory history shows that the benefit of the preference was consistently offered to “any person” who was a veteran. That benefit has been extended to women under a very broad statutory definition of the term veteran. When the totality of legislative actions establishing and extending the Massachusetts veterans’ preference are considered, the law remains what it purports to be: a preference for veterans of either sex over nonveterans of either sex, not for men over women.</p>

<p id="fbedf4d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Powell</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbedf4d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1971 respondent Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (MHDC) applied to petitioner, the Village of Arlington Heights, Ill., for the rezoning of a 15-acre parcel from single-family to multiple-family classification. Using federal financial assistance, MHDC planned to build 190 clustered townhouse units for low- and moderate-income tenants. The Village denied the rezoning request. MHDC, joined by other plaintiffs who are also respondents here, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They alleged that the denial was racially discriminatory and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.</p>
<p id="fbedf4d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision last Term in Washington v. Davis (1976), made it clear that official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact. “Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination.” Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fbedf4d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Davis</i> does not require a plaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes. Rarely can it be said that a legislature or administrative body operating under a broad mandate made a decision motivated solely by a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the “dominant” or “primary” one. In fact, it is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbitrariness or irrationality. But racial discrimination is not just another competing consideration. When there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, this judicial deference is no longer justified.</p>
<p id="fbedf4da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available. The impact of the official action—whether it “bears more heavily on one race than another,” Washington v. Davis—may provide an important starting point. Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face. Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886); Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E16_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E16_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">71</a></span></p>
<p id="fbedf4dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-757">p. 757</span>The evidentiary inquiry is then relatively easy. But such cases are rare. Absent a pattern as stark as that in <i>Gomillion</i> or <i>Yick Wo</i>, impact alone is not determinative, and the Court must look to other evidence.</p>
<p id="fbedf4de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical background of the decision is one evidentiary source, particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes. The specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision also may shed some light on the decisionmaker’s purposes. For example, if the property involved here always had been zoned R-5 but suddenly was changed to R-3 when the town learned of MHDC’s plans to erect integrated housing, we would have a far different case. Departures from the normal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role. Substantive departures too may be relevant, particularly if the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.</p>
<p id="fbee1bef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative or administrative history may be highly relevant, especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or reports. In some extraordinary instances the members might be called to the stand at trial to testify concerning the purpose of the official action, although even then such testimony frequently will be barred by privilege.</p>
<p id="fbee1bf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these in mind, we now address the case before us. The impact of the Village’s decision does arguably bear more heavily on racial minorities. Minorities constitute 18% of the Chicago area population, and 40% of the income groups said to be eligible for Lincoln Green. But there is little about the sequence of events leading up to the decision that would spark suspicion. The area around the Viatorian property has been zoned R-3 since 1959, the year when Arlington Heights first adopted a zoning map. Single-family homes surround the 80-acre site, and the Village is undeniably committed to single-family homes as its dominant residential land use. The rezoning request progressed according to the usual procedures. The Plan Commission even scheduled two additional hearings, at least in part to accommodate MHDC and permit it to supplement its presentation with answers to questions generated at the first hearing. In sum, Respondents simply failed to carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the Village’s decision.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E35_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E35_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">72</a></span></p>

<p id="fbee1bf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-758">p. 758</span>The Court applied the approach described in <i>Arlington Heights</i> in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), which considered an Alabama law that permanently denied the right to vote to anyone convicted of a crime involving “moral turpitude.” The Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional race discrimination for the state to disenfranchise those convicted of misdemeanors. The Court reiterated the approach that it articulated in <i>Arlington Heights</i>: “Once racial discrimination is shown to have been a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor behind enactment of the law, the burden shifts to the law’s defenders to demonstrate that the law would have been enacted without this factor.”</p>
<p id="fbee1bf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence in the case indicated that excluding a misdemeanant from voting had a substantial discriminatory impact against blacks and that racial discrimination was a key purpose of the legislature when the law was adopted in 1901. The Court found no persuasive evidence that the law would have been adopted without this motivation and thus concluded that it was unconstitutional because “its original enactment was motivated by a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of race and the section continues to this day to have that effect.”</p>

<div id="fbee1bf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbee1bf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>APPLICATION: DISCRIMINATORY USE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbee1bf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most important areas where the Supreme Court has followed and applied this analysis is in holding unconstitutional the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. Laws providing for peremptory challenges—the ability of attorneys to exclude prospective jurors without having to prove cause for excusing them—are facially race neutral. But peremptory challenges based on race or gender are motivated by a discriminatory intent and have a discriminatory impact. Thus, the Court has held that race- or gender-based peremptory challenges deny equal protection whether exercised by a prosecutor,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E5C_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E5C_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">73</a></span> a criminal defendant,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E62_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E62_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">74</a></span> or a civil litigant.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E68_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10E68_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">75</a></span></p>
<p id="fbee1bfa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965), the Supreme Court held that racial discrimination by a prosecutor could be proven only by showing a pattern of discriminatory peremptory challenges over a series of cases. A defendant could not allege a denial of equal protection by the prosecution based on how peremptory challenges were exercised in that case; systematic discrimination had to be proven. In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 76 (1986), the Supreme Court overruled Swain v. Alabama and explained that “[a] single invidiously <span title="759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-759">p. 759</span>discriminatory governmental act is not immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.”</p>
<p id="fbee430b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Batson</i> thus holds that the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by a prosecutor denies equal protection. <i>Batson</i> set forth a three-step process for determining whether there is impermissible discrimination in jury selection. First, the criminal defendant must set forth a prima facie case of discrimination by the prosecutor. The Supreme Court has not articulated precise standards for determining what is a prima facie case. In <i>Batson</i>, the Court said that “the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant’s race.” But in practice what is enough for a prima facie case is unclear. The Court simply expressed “confidence that trial judges, experienced in supervising voir dire” would be able to “consider all relevant circumstances” and decide if there is a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbee430c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, once the defendant has presented a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to offer a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges. The Court said that the proponent of a strike “must give a ‘clear and reasonably specific’ explanation of his ‘legitimate reasons’ for exercising the challenges.” Subsequently, in Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995), the Supreme Court said that “[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. . . . It is not until the <i>third</i> step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant.” In other words, the second step is simply the prosecutor offering the explanation; the third step is where the justification is evaluated.</p>
<p id="fbee430d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the third step, the trial court must decide whether the race-neutral explanation is persuasive or whether the “defendant has established purposeful discrimination.” In two cases since <i>Batson</i>, the Supreme Court has elaborated this step and made it easier for courts to find a neutral explanation for the strikes of prospective jurors. In Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), the Court found that there was a sufficient race-neutral explanation when a prosecutor said that he had struck two prospective Latino jurors because they spoke Spanish and therefore might not accept the translator’s version of testimony from witnesses who were going to testify in Spanish.</p>
<p id="fbee430e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, in Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995), the Supreme Court said that “a ‘legitimate reason’ is not a reason that makes sense, but a reason that does not deny equal protection.” <i>Purkett</i> did not elaborate; it is a short per curiam opinion, and there had been neither briefing nor oral arguments in the case. The Court upheld a trial court’s conclusion that there was no discriminatory purpose when a prosecutor struck a prospective juror because of “long, unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard.” If any “legitimate reason,” even one that does not make sense, is sufficient, <i>Batson</i> will be substantially weakened. It almost always will be possible for a prosecutor to articulate some race-neutral reason for a strike, such as the physical appearance of the prospective juror.</p>
<p id="fbee430f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court continues to apply <i>Batson</i>. Most recently, in Flowers v. Mississippi, 139 S. Ct. 2228 (2019), the Court held <span title="760" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-760">p. 760</span>that <i>Batson</i> was violated when the same prosecutor struck 41 of 42 African-American jurors over six trials involving the same defendant. In Foster v. Chatman, 136 S. Ct. 1737 (2016), the Court held that <i>Batson</i> was violated when documents obtained via a public records request showed that the prosecutor had intentionally excluded African-American jurors.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EA6_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10EA6_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">76</a></span></p>
<p id="fbee4311-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Batson</i> involved only the issue of discriminatory peremptory strikes by prosecutors, the Court subsequently expanded it to apply to civil litigants and criminal defendants. In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991), the Supreme Court ruled that <i>Batson</i> applies in private civil litigation. The Court explained that there is state action because peremptory challenges are authorized by state law and supervised by courts. In Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992), the Supreme Court held that criminal defendants may not exercise peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner. Although criminal defendants are the antithesis of the government, the Court followed its earlier rulings that prospective jurors have a right to be free from discrimination in jury selection<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EB5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10EB5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">77</a></span> and that there is state action when a private party exercises peremptory challenges.</p>
<p id="fbee4313-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994), the Supreme Court extended <i>Batson</i> to apply to gender-based discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Blackmun, stressed the long history of discrimination against women in the legal system and concluded that gender, like race, was an impermissible basis for peremptory challenges. The Court indicated, however, that <i>Batson</i> only would apply to types of discrimination that would receive heightened scrutiny under equal protection analysis. In addition to race and gender, this would include discrimination against nonmarital children and aliens; neither, however, is likely to be a basis for peremptory challenges, especially since aliens are usually not allowed to serve on juries. An unresolved issue is whether <i>Batson</i> will apply to peremptory challenges based on religion or sexual orientation.</p>

<p id="fbee6a28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a court finds that there is an equal protection violation, it then must fashion a remedy. In some cases, the remedy is simply invalidating the discriminatory law. For example, in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1879), the remedy was declaring unconstitutional the law prohibiting blacks from serving on juries; in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the remedy was invalidating the law prohibiting interracial marriage.</p>
<p id="fbee6a29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases, the Court must go further and fashion an injunction. For example, in desegregation cases, the Court generally will issue an order prohibiting <span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-761">p. 761</span>the offending conduct. If a state had a law requiring segregation of a park or a beach, the Court would declare the law unconstitutional and also issue an injunction preventing continued segregation of the facility.</p>
<p id="fbee6a2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fashioning a remedy was most difficult, by far, in the area of school desegregation. In the area of schools, it was not sufficient simply to order removal of the “whites only” sign. Pupils and teachers had to be reassigned. Because schools tend to serve neighborhoods and residential segregation was prevalent, desegregating schools proved extremely difficult. Indeed, in Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954, the Supreme Court did not address the issue of remedies but instead set the case for reargument as to the issue of the appropriate remedies. This is the Court’s short decision the next year on the question of remedies.</p>

<p id="fbee6a31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases were decided on May 17, 1954. The opinions of that date, declaring the fundamental principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional, are incorporated herein by reference. All provisions of federal, state, or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle. There remains for consideration the manner in which relief is to be accorded.</p>
<p id="fbee6a32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because these cases arose under different local conditions and their disposition will involve a variety of local problems, we requested further argument on the question of relief. These presentations were informative and helpful to the Court in its consideration of the complexities arising from the transition to a system of public education freed of racial discrimination. The presentations also demonstrated that substantial steps to eliminate racial discrimination in public schools have already been taken, not only in some of the communities in which these cases arose, but in some of the states appearing as amici curiae, and in other states as well. Substantial progress has been made in the District of Columbia and in the communities in Kansas and Delaware involved in this litigation. The defendants in the cases coming to us from South Carolina and Virginia are awaiting the decision of this Court concerning relief.</p>
<p id="fbee6a33-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems. School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional principles. Because of their proximity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand the cases to those courts.</p>
<p id="fbee6a34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs. These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis. <span title="762" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-762">p. 762</span>To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision. Courts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.</p>
<p id="fbee9145-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While giving weight to these public and private considerations, the courts will require that the defendants make a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with our May 17, 1954, ruling. Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner. The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable date. To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems. They will also consider the adequacy of any plans the defendants may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system. During this period of transition, the courts will retain jurisdiction of these cases.</p>
<p id="fbee9146-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgments below are accordingly reversed and the cases are remanded to the District Courts to take such proceedings and enter such orders and decrees consistent with this opinion as are necessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties to these cases.</p>

<p id="fbee914b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court first responded to this in Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958). The Little Rock school system was ordered desegregated during the 1957-1958 school year, but the governor called out the Arkansas National Guard to keep blacks out. Black students began attending the previously all-white high school only after President Dwight Eisenhower used federal troops to protect them. The Little Rock school system then asked for a stay of the integration plan. The U.S. Supreme Court responded with an unusual opinion that was signed by each of the nine justices. The Court began its opinion by declaring, “As this case reaches us it raises questions of the highest importance to the maintenance of our federal system of government. It necessarily involves a claim <span title="763" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-763">p. 763</span>by the Governor and Legislature of a State that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this Court’s considered interpretation of the United States Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbee914c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court declared that “[t]he constitutional rights of respondents are not to be sacrificed or yielded to the violence and disorder which have followed upon the actions of the Governor and Legislature.” The Court invoked Marbury v. Madison to respond to the state’s claim that it did not have to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision. The Court said, “[<i>Marbury</i>] declared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system. It follows that the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment enunciated by this Court in the <i>Brown</i> case is the supreme law of the land. . . . No state legislator or executive or judicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it.” The Court strongly reaffirmed <i>Brown</i> and said that it could not be nullified either “openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers” or “indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted ‘ingeniously or ingenuously.’”</p>
<p id="fbee914d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cooper v. Aaron, however, did not end efforts by Southern states to circumvent <i>Brown</i> and prevent desegregation.

Aaron, the Supreme Court did not hear a school desegregation case for almost a decade after <i>Brown</i>. In a series of cases in the mid- and late 1960s, the Court declared unconstitutional various obstructionist techniques used throughout the South. In 1963, in Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683 (1963), the Supreme Court invalidated a Knoxville, Tennessee, law that allowed students who were assigned to new schools as part of desegregation to transfer from schools where they were a racial minority to ones where they would be in the racial majority. In other words, a white student who was placed in a predominately black school could transfer back to a white school, and a <span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-764">p. 764</span>black student who was placed in a predominately white school could do the same.

<p id="fbeeb767-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Griffin v. County School Bd., 377 U.S. 218 (1964), the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional for school systems to close rather than desegregate. In 1959, Prince Edward County, Virginia, closed its school system rather than comply with a desegregation order. The Court ordered the schools reopened and explained that “[w]hatever nonracial grounds might support a State’s allowing a county to abandon public schools, the object must be a constitutional one, and grounds of race and opposition to desegregation do not qualify as constitutional.” The Court also expressed its frustration with the resistance to desegregation and declared that “[t]here has been entirely too much deliberation and not enough speed.”</p>
<p id="fbeeb768-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1969, in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a “freedom of choice plan” that was a common approach used to frustrate desegregation. A school system in rural Virginia adopted a desegregation plan where students could choose which school to attend. Three years after it was enacted, no white student was attending a black school, and only 15 percent of black students were attending white schools. The Court said that “[i]t is incumbent upon the school board to establish that its proposed plan promises meaningful and immediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segregation. . . . Of course, the availability to the board of other more promising courses of action may indicate a lack of good faith; and at the least it places a heavy burden upon the board to explain its preference for an apparently less effective method.” The Court emphatically declared that school boards have “the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.”</p>
<p id="fbeede79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These Supreme Court decisions ending obstruction to desegregation were accompanied by an important federal law: the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI prohibited discrimination by schools receiving federal funds. This became especially significant when Congress enacted the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which appropriated $2.5 billion for schools. Additionally, the 1964 Civil Rights Act authorized the U.S. attorney general to intervene in desegregation suits.</p>
<p id="fbeede7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The combination of federal court action and the federal law had an effect in bringing about desegregation. One by one the obstructionist techniques were defeated. Finally, by the mid-1960s, desegregation began to proceed. By 1968, the integration rate in the South rose to 32 percent, and by 1972-1973, 91.3 percent of Southern schools were desegregated.</p>

Indeed, racial segregation in American schools has been increasing over the past decade.

Professor Orfield’s study shows that nationally the percentage of African American students attending schools with exclusively African American enrollment and schools where over 90 percent of the students are African American has increased dramatically over the past 15 years. A study by in 2012 by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that across the country, 43 percent of Latinos and 38 percent of blacks attend schools where fewer than 10 percent of their classmates are white. More than one in seven black and Latino students attend schools where fewer than 1 percent of their classmates are white.</p>

Segregation was the evil struck down by <i>Brown I</i> as contrary to the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution. That was the violation sought to be corrected by the remedial measures of <i>Brown II</i>. If school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under these holdings, judicial authority may be invoked. Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.</p>
<p id="fbef059e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In seeking to define even in broad and general terms how far this remedial power extends it is important to remember that judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation. Remedial judicial authority does not put judges automatically in the shoes of school authorities whose powers are plenary. Judicial authority enters only when local authority defaults.</p>
<p id="fbef059f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school segregation, the existence of a pattern of school construction and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight. In devising remedies where legally imposed segregation has been established, it is the responsibility of local authorities and district courts to see to it that future school construction and abandonment are not used and do not serve to perpetuate or re-establish the dual system. When necessary, district courts should retain jurisdiction to assure that these responsibilities are carried out.</p>

<p id="fbef2cb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case it is urged that the District Court has imposed a racial balance requirement of 71%-29% on individual schools. As the voluminous record in this case shows, the predicate for the District Court’s use of the 71%-29% ratio was twofold: first, its express finding, approved by the Court of Appeals and not challenged here, that a dual school system had been maintained by the school authorities at least until 1969; second, its finding, also approved by the Court of Appeals, that the school board had totally defaulted in its acknowledged duty to come forward with an acceptable plan of its own, notwithstanding the patient efforts of the District Judge who, on at least three occasions, urged the board to submit plans.</p>
<p id="fbef2cb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see therefore that the use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting point in the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.

<p id="fbef2cb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record in this case reveals the familiar phenomenon that in metropolitan areas minority groups are often found concentrated in one part of the city. In some circumstances certain schools may remain all or largely of one race until new schools can be provided or neighborhood patterns change. Schools all or predominantly of one race in a district of mixed population will require close scrutiny to determine that school assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.</p>
<p id="fbef2cba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the above, it should be clear that the existence of some small number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark of a system that still practices segregation by law. The district judge or school authorities should make every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation and will thus necessarily be concerned with the elimination of one-race schools. No per se rule can adequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the competing interests involved; but in a system with a history of segregation the need for remedial criteria of sufficient specificity to assure a school authority’s compliance with its constitutional duty warrants a presumption against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition. Where the school authority’s proposed plan for conversion from a dual to a unitary system contemplates the continued existence of some schools that are all or predominately of one race, they have the burden of showing that such school assignments are genuinely nondiscriminatory. The court should scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school authorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is not the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.</p>

<p id="fbef2cbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The maps submitted in these cases graphically demonstrate that one of the principal tools employed by school planners and by courts to break up the dual school system has been a frank—and sometimes drastic—gerrymandering of school districts and attendance zones. As an interim corrective measure, this cannot be said to be beyond the broad remedial powers of a court.</p>
<p id="fbef2cbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>
<p id="fbef2cbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it must be recognized that there are limits. The objective is to dismantle the dual school system. “Racially neutral” assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of school size in order <span title="768" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-768">p. 768</span>to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation. When school authorities present a district court with a “loaded game board,” affirmative action in the form of remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to achieve truly nondiscriminatory assignments.

No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of situations. Bus transportation has been an integral part of the public education system for years, and was perhaps the single most important factor in the transition from the one-room schoolhouse to the consolidated school. Eighteen million of the Nation’s public school children, approximately 39%, were transported to their schools by bus in 1969-1970 in all parts of the country.</p>
<p id="fbef53d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The importance of bus transportation as a normal and accepted tool of educational policy is readily discernible.

The District Court’s conclusion that assignment of children to the school nearest their home serving their grade would not produce an effective dismantling of the dual system is supported by the record.</p>
<p id="fbef53d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the remedial techniques used in the District Court’s order were within that court’s power to provide equitable relief; implementation of the decree is well within the capacity of the school authority. The decree provided that the buses used to implement the plan would operate on direct routes. Students would be picked up at schools near their homes and transported to the schools they were to attend. The trips for elementary school pupils average about seven miles and the District Court found that they would take “not over 35 minutes at the most.” This system compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated in Charlotte under which each day 26,600 students on all grade levels were transported an average of 15 miles one way for an average trip requiring over an hour. In these circumstances, we find no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not be required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation. Desegregation plans cannot be limited to the walk-in school.</p>
<p id="fbef53d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of travel is so great as to either risk the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process. District courts must weigh the soundness of any transportation plan. It hardly needs stating that the limits on time of travel will vary with many factors, but probably with none more than the age of the students. The reconciliation of competing values in a desegregation case is, of course, a difficult task with many sensitive facets but fundamentally no more so than remedial measures courts of equity have traditionally employed.</p>

<p id="fbef53dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari in these consolidated cases to determine whether a federal court may impose a multidistrict, areawide remedy to a single-district de jure segregation problem absent any finding that the other included school districts have failed to operate unitary school systems within their districts, absent any claim or finding that the boundary lines of any affected school district were established with the purpose of fostering racial segregation in public schools, absent any finding that the included districts committed acts which effected segregation within the other districts, and absent a meaningful opportunity for the included neighboring school districts to present evidence or be heard on the propriety of a multidistrict remedy or on the question of constitutional violations by those neighboring districts.</p>
<p id="fbef53dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewing the record as a whole, it seems clear that the District Court and the Court of Appeals shifted the primary focus from a Detroit remedy to the metropolitan area only because of their conclusion that total desegregation of Detroit would not produce the racial balance which they perceived as desirable. Both courts proceeded on an assumption that the Detroit schools could not be truly desegregated—in their view of what constituted desegregation—unless the racial composition of the student body of each school substantially reflected the racial composition of the population of the metropolitan area as a whole. The metropolitan area was then defined as Detroit plus 53 of the outlying school districts.</p>
<p id="fbef53de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The metropolitan remedy would require, in effect, consolidation of 54 independent school districts historically administered as separate units into a vast new super school district. Entirely apart from the logistical and other serious problems attending large-scale transportation of students, the consolidation would give rise to an array of other problems in financing and operating this new school system. Some of the more obvious questions would be: What would be the status and authority of the present popularly elected school boards? Would the children of Detroit be within the jurisdiction and operating control of a school board elected by the parents and residents of other districts? What board or boards would levy taxes for school operations in these 54 districts constituting the consolidated metropolitan area? What provisions could be made for assuring substantial equality in tax levies among the 54 districts, if this were deemed requisite? What provisions would be made for financing? Would the <span title="770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-770">p. 770</span>validity of long-term bonds be jeopardized unless approved by all of the component districts as well as the State? What body would determine that portion of the curricula now left to the discretion of local school boards? Who would establish attendance zones, purchase school equipment, locate and construct new schools, and indeed attend to all the myriad day-to-day decisions that are necessary to school operations affecting potentially more than three-quarters of a million pupils?</p>
<p id="fbef53df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The controlling principle consistently expounded in our holdings is that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation. Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must first be shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district. Specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of interdistrict segregation. Thus an interdistrict remedy might be in order where the racially discriminatory acts of one or more school districts caused racial segregation in an adjacent district, or where district lines have been deliberately drawn on the basis of race. In such circumstances an interdistrict remedy would be appropriate to eliminate the interdistrict segregation directly caused by the constitutional violation. Conversely, without an interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.</p>
<p id="fbef53e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record before us, voluminous as it is, contains evidence of de jure segregated conditions only in the Detroit schools; indeed, that was the theory on which the litigation was initially based and on which the District Court took evidence. With no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any interdistrict violation or effect, the court went beyond the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings and mandated a metropolitan area remedy. To approve the remedy ordered by the court would impose on the outlying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a wholly impermissible remedy based on a standard not hinted at in <i>Brown I</i> and <i>II</i> or any holding of this Court.</p>

<p id="fbef7af2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court and the Court of Appeals found that over a long period of years those in charge of the Michigan public schools engaged in various practices calculated to effect the segregation of the Detroit school system. The Court does not question these findings, nor could it reasonably do so. Neither does it question the obligation of the federal courts to devise a feasible and effective remedy. But it promptly cripples the ability of the judiciary to perform this task, which is of fundamental importance to our constitutional system, by fashioning a strict rule that remedies in school cases must stop at the school district line unless certain other conditions are met. As applied here, the remedy for unquestioned violations of the protection rights of Detroit’s Negroes by the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan must be totally confined to the limits of the school district and may not reach into adjoining or surrounding districts unless and until it is proved there has been some sort of “interdistrict violation”—unless unconstitutional actions of the Detroit School Board have <span title="771" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-771">p. 771</span>had a segregative impact on other districts, or unless the segregated condition of the Detroit schools has itself been influenced by segregative practices in those surrounding districts into which it is proposed to extend the remedy.</p>
<p id="fbef7af3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The core of my disagreement is that deliberate acts of segregation and their consequences will go unremedied, not because a remedy would be infeasible or unreasonable in terms of the usual criteria governing school desegregation cases, but because an effective remedy would cause what the Court considers to be undue administrative inconvenience to the State. The result is that the State of Michigan, the entity at which the Fourteenth Amendment is directed, has successfully insulated itself from its duty to provide effective desegregation remedies by vesting sufficient power over its public schools in its local school districts. If this is the case in Michigan, it will be the case in most States.</p>
<p id="fbef7af4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed in this light, remedies calling for school zoning, pairing, and pupil assignments, become more and more suspect as they require that schoolchildren spend more and more time in buses going to and from school and that more and more educational dollars be diverted to transportation systems. Manifestly, these considerations are of immediate and urgent concern when the issue is the desegregation of a city school system where residential patterns are predominantly segregated and the respective areas occupied by blacks and whites are heavily populated and geographically extensive. Thus, if one postulates a metropolitan school system covering a sufficiently large area, with the population evenly divided between whites and Negroes and with the races occupying identifiable residential areas, there will be very real practical limits on the extent to which racially identifiable schools can be eliminated within the school district. It is also apparent that the larger the proportion of Negroes in the area, the more difficult it would be to avoid having a substantial number of all-black or nearly all-black schools.</p>

<p id="fbef7af5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Milliken</i> has a significant effect limiting the ability to achieve desegregation in many areas. In a number of major cities, inner-city school systems are substantially black and are surrounded by almost all-white suburbs. Desegregation obviously requires the ability to transfer students between the city and suburban schools. There simply are not enough white students in the city, or enough black students in the suburbs, to achieve desegregation without an interdistrict remedy. Yet <i>Milliken</i> precludes an interdistrict remedy unless there is proof of an interdistrict violation. In other words, a multidistrict remedy can be formulated for those districts whose own policies fostered discrimination or if a state law caused the interdistrict segregation. Otherwise, the remedy can include only those districts found to violate the Constitution. Such proof is often not available, although there have been some cases where the requirements of <i>Milliken</i> have been met.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1112D_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1112D_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">90</a></span></p>
<p id="fbef7af7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Milliken</i> can be defended based on the traditional principle that a court has the authority to impose a remedy only after it is proven that the person or entity <span title="772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-772">p. 772</span>violated the law. But critics of <i>Milliken</i> argue that the segregated pattern in major metropolitan areas—blacks in the city and whites in the suburbs—did not occur by accident, but rather was the product of myriad government policies. Additionally, in many areas <i>Milliken</i> means no desegregation. Critics argue that together with San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1114E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1114E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">91</a></span>—which held that disparities in school funding do not violate equal protection—the result is separate and unequal schools: wealthy white suburban schools spending a great deal on education surrounding much poorer black city schools that spend much less on education.</p>

<p id="fbef7afb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In several cases, the Supreme Court has considered when a federal court desegregation order should be ended. The Court first addressed this issue in Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (1976). <i>Pasadena</i> involved a school system that had been segregated by law. A federal court order succeeded in desegregation: In 1970, no schools within the district were racially imbalanced. By 1974, five of the 32 schools in the district were over half black. The district court ordered that attendance lines be redrawn on an annual basis so that blacks would not be a majority in any school in the district. The Supreme Court deemed this improper. The Court noted that residential shifts were inevitable in cities and that they might alter the racial composition of the schools. The Court said that “having once implemented a racially neutral attendance pattern in order to remedy the perceived constitutional violations on the part of the defendants, the District Court had fully performed its function of providing the appropriate remedy for previous racially discriminatory attendance patterns.” In the 1990s, the Court revisited this issue and held that federal court desegregation orders should end when a school reaches “unitary status.”</p>

In 1961, respondents, black students and their parents, sued petitioners, the Board of Education of Oklahoma City (Board), to end de jure segregation in the public schools. In 1963, the District Court found that Oklahoma City had intentionally segregated both schools and housing in the past, and that Oklahoma City was operating a “dual” school system—one that was intentionally segregated by race. In 1965, the District Court found that the School Board’s attempt to desegregate by using neighborhood zoning failed to remedy past segregation <span title="773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-773">p. 773</span>because residential segregation resulted in one-race schools. In 1972, finding that previous efforts had not been successful at eliminating state imposed segregation, the District Court ordered the Board to adopt the “Finger Plan,” under which kindergarteners would be assigned to neighborhood schools unless their parents opted otherwise; children in grades 1-4 would attend formerly all white schools, and thus black children would be bused to those schools; children in grade 5 would attend formerly all black schools, and thus white children would be bused to those schools; students in the upper grades would be bused to various areas in order to maintain integrated schools; and in integrated neighborhoods there would be stand-alone schools for all grades.</p>
<p id="fbefa214-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lower courts have been inconsistent in their use of the term “unitary.” Some have used it to identify a school district that has completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. Under that interpretation of the word, a unitary school district is one that has met the mandate of Brown v. Board of Education. Other courts, however, have used “unitary” to describe any school district that has currently desegregated student assignments, whether or not that status is solely the result of a court-imposed desegregation plan. In other words, such a school district could be called unitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbefa215-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by the local authorities. Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period of time properly recognizes that “necessary concern for the important values of local control of public school systems dictates that a federal court’s regulatory control of such systems not extend beyond the time required to remedy the effects of past intentional discrimination.”</p>

The District Court should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the extent practicable.</p>

For the next 65 years, the Oklahoma City School Board maintained segregated schools—initially relying on laws requiring dual school systems; thereafter, by exploiting residential segregation that had been created by legally enforced restrictive covenants. In 1972—18 years after this Court first found segregated schools unconstitutional—a federal court finally interrupted this cycle, enjoining the Oklahoma City School Board to implement a specific plan for achieving actual desegregation of its schools.</p>
<p id="fbefa219-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practical question now before us is whether, 13 years after that injunction was imposed, the same School Board should have been allowed to return many of its elementary schools to their former one-race status.

<p id="fbefc92a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe a desegregation decree cannot be lifted so long as conditions likely to inflict the stigmatic injury condemned in <i>Brown I</i> persist and there remain feasible methods of eliminating such conditions.

It was not until 1977 that a federal district court ordered the desegregation of the Kansas City, Missouri, public schools. The federal court’s desegregation effort made a difference. In 1983, 24 schools in the district had an African American enrollment of more than 90 percent or more. By 1993, no elementary-level student attended a school with an enrollment that was 90 percent or more African American. At the middle school and high school levels, the percentage of students attending schools with an African American enrollment of 90 percent or more declined from about 45 percent to 22 percent.</p>
<p id="fbefc92f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, ruled in favor of the state on every issue. There were three parts to the Court’s holding. First, the Court ruled that the district court’s order that attempted to attract nonminority students from outside the district was impermissible because there was no proof of an interdistrict violation. Chief Justice Rehnquist applied Milliken v. Bradley to conclude that the interdistrict remedy—incentives to attract students from outside the district into the Kansas City schools—was impermissible because there only was proof of an intradistrict violation.</p>
<p id="fbefc930-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court ruled that the district court lacked authority to order an increase in teacher salaries. Although the district court believed that an across-the-board salary increase to attract teachers was essential for desegregation, the Supreme Court concluded that it was not necessary as a remedy.</p>
<p id="fbefc931-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court ruled that the continued disparity in student test scores did not justify continuance of the federal court’s desegregation order. The Court <span title="775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-775">p. 775</span>concluded that the Constitution requires equal opportunity and not any result and that therefore disparities between African American and white students on standardized tests was not a sufficient basis for concluding that desegregation had not been achieved. The Supreme Court held that once a desegregation order is complied with, the federal court effort should be ended. Disparity in test scores is not a basis for continued federal court involvement.</p>

<p id="fbefc939-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school districts in these cases voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely upon race to determine which public schools certain children may attend. The Seattle school district classifies children as white or nonwhite; the Jefferson County school district as black or “other.” In Seattle, this racial classification is used to allocate slots in oversubscribed high schools. In Jefferson County, it is used to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests. In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student’s race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predetermined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole. Parents of students denied assignment to particular schools under these plans solely because of their race brought suit, contending that allocating children to different public schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>

<p id="fbeff04b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both cases present the same underlying legal question—whether a public school that had not operated legally segregated schools or has been found to be unitary may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that classification in making school assignments. Although we examine the plans under the same legal framework, the specifics of the two plans, and the circumstances surrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite different.</p>

<p id="fbeff04d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public high schools. In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this case for assigning students to these schools. The <span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>plan allows incoming ninth graders to choose from among any of the district’s high schools, ranking however many schools they wish in order of preference.</p>
<p id="fbeff04e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some schools are more popular than others. If too many students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs a series of “tiebreakers” to determine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next tiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the particular school and the race of the individual student. In the district’s public schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as nonwhite. If an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage points of the district’s overall white/nonwhite racial balance, it is what the district calls “integration positive,” and the district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment students whose race “will serve to bring the school into balance.” If it is still necessary to select students for the school after using the racial tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the student’s residence.</p>
<p id="fbeff04f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seattle has never operated segregated schools—legally separate schools for students of different races—nor has it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation. It nonetheless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt to address the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on school assignments. Most white students live in the northern part of Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the southern part.</p>

In 1973 a federal court found that Jefferson County had maintained a segregated school system, and in 1975 the District Court entered a desegregation decree. Jefferson County operated under this decree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had achieved unitary status by eliminating “[t]o the greatest extent practicable” the vestiges of its prior policy of segregation.</p>
<p id="fbf01762-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2001, after the decree had been dissolved, Jefferson County adopted the voluntary student assignment plan at issue in this case. Approximately 34 percent of the district’s 97,000 students are black; most of the remaining 66 percent are white. The plan requires all nonmagnet schools to maintain a minimum black enrollment of 15 percent, and a maximum black enrollment of 50 percent.</p>
<p id="fbf01763-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the elementary school level, based on his or her address, each student is designated a “resides” school to which students within a specific geographic area are assigned; elementary resides schools are “grouped into clusters in order to facilitate integration.” The district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents of kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district may submit an application indicating a first and second choice among the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit such an application are assigned within the cluster by the district. “Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the schools and the racial guidelines in the District’s current student assignment plan.” If a school has reached the “extremes of the racial guidelines,” a student whose race would contribute to the school’s racial imbalance will not be assigned there. After assignment, students at all grade levels are permitted to apply to transfer <span title="777" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-777">p. 777</span>between nonmagnet schools in the district.

<p id="fbf01766-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny. In order to satisfy this searching standard of review, the school districts must demonstrate that the use of individual racial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” government interest.</p>
<p id="fbf01767-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the interests a school district might assert, it suffices to note that our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classifications in the school context, have recognized two interests that qualify as compelling. The first is the compelling interest of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination. Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that they were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to court-ordered desegregation decrees. The Jefferson County public schools were previously segregated by law and were subject to a desegregation decree entered in 1975. In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree dissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had “eliminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects,” and thus had achieved “unitary” status. Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an interest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination in defending its present use of race in assigning students.</p>
<p id="fbf01768-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor could it. We have emphasized that the harm being remedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm that is traceable to segregation, and that “the Constitution is not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without more.” Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it had remedied the constitutional wrong that allowed race-based assignments. Any continued use of race must be justified on some other basis.</p>
<p id="fbf01769-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second government interest we have recognized as compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest in diversity in higher education upheld in Grutter [v. Bollinger (2003)]. The specific interest found compelling in <i>Grutter</i> was student body diversity “in the context of higher education.” The diversity interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed “all factors that may contribute to student body diversity.” The entire gist of the analysis in <i>Grutter</i> was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a particular racial group. The classification of applicants by race upheld in <i>Grutter</i> was only as part of a highly individualized, holistic review.</p>
<p id="fbf0176a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve “exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints”; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone. The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself. It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching <span title="778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-778">p. 778</span>a decision, as in <i>Grutter</i>; it is <i>the</i> factor. Like the University of Michigan undergraduate plan struck down in Gratz [v. Bollinger (2003)], the plans here “do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants” but instead rely on racial classifications in a “nonindividualized, mechanical” way.</p>
<p id="fbf03e7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/”other” terms in Jefferson County. The Seattle “Board Statement Reaffirming Diversity Rationale” speaks of the “inherent educational value” in “[p]roviding students the opportunity to attend schools with diverse student enrollment.” But under the Seattle plan, a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not. It is hard to understand how a plan that could allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is “‘broadly diverse.’”</p>
<p id="fbf03e7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In upholding the admissions plan in <i>Grutter</i>, though, this Court relied upon considerations unique to institutions of higher education, noting that in light of “the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.” The Court explained that “[c]ontext matters” in applying strict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was addressing the use of race “in the context of higher education.” The Court in <i>Grutter</i> expressly articulated key limitations on its holding—defining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher education—but these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending <i>Grutter</i> to uphold race-based assignments in elementary and secondary schools. The present cases are not governed by <i>Grutter</i>.</p>

<p id="fbf03e7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps recognizing that reliance on <i>Grutter</i> cannot sustain their plans, both school districts assert additional interests, distinct from the interest upheld in <i>Grutter</i>, to justify their race-based assignments. Each school district argues that educational and broader socialization benefits flow from a racially diverse learning environment, and each contends that because the diversity they seek is racial diversity—not the broader diversity at issue in <i>Grutter</i>—it makes sense to promote that interest directly by relying on race alone.</p>
<p id="fbf03e7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and their amici dispute whether racial diversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits. The debate is not one we need to resolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classifications employed by the districts are not narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits asserted to flow from racial diversity. In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.</p>
<p id="fbf03e80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective school districts—or rather the white/nonwhite or black/”other” balance of the districts, since that is the only diversity <span title="779" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-779">p. 779</span>addressed by the plans. Indeed, in its brief Seattle simply assumes that the educational benefits track the racial breakdown of the district.</p>
<p id="fbf03e81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This working backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits, is a fatal flaw under our existing precedent. We have many times over reaffirmed that “[r]acial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake.”</p>
<p id="fbf03e82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to our repeated recognition that “[a]t the heart of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class.” Allowing racial balancing as a compelling end in itself would “effectively assur[e] that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the ‘ultimate goal’ of ‘eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human being’s race’ will never be achieved.”</p>
<p id="fbf03e83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle that racial balancing is not permitted is one of substance, not semantics. Racial balancing is not transformed from “patently unconstitutional” to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it “racial diversity.” While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promote—racial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—they offer no definition of the interest that suggests it differs from racial balance.</p>

<p id="fbf03e85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The districts assert, as they must, that the way in which they have employed individual racial classifications is necessary to achieve their stated ends. The minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments, however, suggests that other means would be effective. Seattle’s racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools. Approximately 307 student assignments were affected by the racial tiebreaker in 2000-2001. In over one-third of the assignments affected by the racial tiebreaker the use of race in the end made no difference, and the district could identify only 52 students who were ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker in that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not listed as a preference and to which they would not otherwise have been assigned. Similarly, Jefferson County’s use of racial classifications has only a minimal effect on the assignment of students.</p>
<p id="fbf06596-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we do not suggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts’ racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications. Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents and our Nation’s history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.</p>
<p id="fbf06597-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The districts have also failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring requires “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,” and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plans—many of which would not have used express racial classifications—were rejected with little or no consideration. Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it <span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-780">p. 780</span>considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications.</p>

<p id="fbf06599-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer’s dissent takes a different approach to these cases, one that fails to ground the result it would reach in law. Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable precedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary holdings, alters and misapplies our well-established legal framework for assessing equal protection challenges to express racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the consequences of today’s decision.</p>
<p id="fbf0659a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer’s position comes down to a familiar claim: The end justifies the means. He admits that “there is a cost in applying ‘a state-mandated racial label,’” but he is confident that the cost is worth paying. Our established strict scrutiny test for racial classifications, however, insists on “detailed examination, both as to ends and as to means.” Simply because the school districts may seek a worthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on the basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifications should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbf0659b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not apply, Justice Breyer repeatedly urges deference to local school boards on these issues. Such deference “is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.”</p>
<p id="fbf0659c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts’ own terms, the costs are undeniable. “[D]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.” Government action dividing us by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote “notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,” “reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,” and “endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.”</p>
<p id="fbf0659d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and their amici debate which side is more faithful to the heritage of <i>Brown</i>, but the position of the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> was spelled out in their brief and could not have been clearer: “[T]he Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race.” What do the racial classifications at issue here do, if not accord differential treatment on the basis of race? As counsel who appeared before this Court for the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> put it: “We have one fundamental contention which we will seek to develop in the course of this argument, and that contention is that no State has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.” There is no ambiguity in that statement. And it was that position that prevailed in this Court, which emphasized in its remedial opinion that what was “[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory <span title="781" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-781">p. 781</span>basis,” and what was required was “determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis.” <i>Brown II</i>. What do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not determine admission to a public school on a racial basis?</p>
<p id="fbf0659e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before <i>Brown</i>, schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again—even for very different reasons. For schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way “to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis,” is to stop assigning students on a racial basis. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.</p>
<p id="fbf0659f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fbf065a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, the Court holds that state entities may not experiment with race-based means to achieve ends they deem socially desirable. I wholly concur in the Chief Justice’s opinion. I write separately to address several of the contentions in Justice Breyer’s dissent. Contrary to the dissent’s arguments, resegregation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these school boards have no present interest in remedying past segregation; and these race-based student-assignment programs do not serve any compelling state interest. Accordingly, the plans are unconstitutional. Disfavoring a color-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent would give school boards a free hand to make decisions on the basis of race—an approach reminiscent of that advocated by the segregationists in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). This approach is just as wrong today as it was a half-century ago. The Constitution and our cases require us to be much more demanding before permitting local school boards to make decisions based on race.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there is arguably a danger of racial imbalance in schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger of resegregation. No one contends that Seattle has established or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school system that separates students on the basis of race. The statistics cited in the dissent are not to the contrary. At most, those statistics show a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance. However, racial imbalance without intentional state action to separate the races does not amount to segregation. To raise the specter of resegregation to defend these programs is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature of the cases before us.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent asserts that racially balanced schools improve educational outcomes for black children. In support, the dissent unquestioningly cites certain social science research to support propositions that are hotly disputed among social scientists. In reality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing has any educational benefits, much less that integration is necessary to black achievement.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scholars have differing opinions as to whether educational benefits arise from racial balancing. Some have concluded that black students receive genuine educational benefits. Add to the inconclusive social science the fact of black achievement in “racially isolated” environments. Before <i>Brown</i>, the most prominent example of an exemplary black school was Dunbar High School. Dunbar is by no means an isolated example. Given this tenuous relationship between <span title="782" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-782">p. 782</span>forced racial mixing and improved educational results for black children, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educational element supports the integration interest, let alone makes it compelling.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should escape no one that behind Justice Breyer’s veil of judicial modesty hides an inflated role for the Federal Judiciary. The dissent’s approach confers on judges the power to say what sorts of discrimination are benign and which are invidious. Having made that determination (based on no objective measure that I can detect), a judge following the dissent’s approach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the desired result. Only then must the judge defer to a democratic majority. In my view, to defer to one’s preferred result is not to defer at all.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the dissent’s criticisms of today’s result can be traced to its rejection of the color-blind Constitution. The dissent attempts to marginalize the notion of a color-blind Constitution by consigning it to me and Members of today’s plurality. But I am quite comfortable in the company I keep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan’s view in <i>Plessy</i>: “Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” And my view was the rallying cry for the lawyers who litigated <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p id="fbf08cb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plans before us base school assignment decisions on students’ race.

<p id="fbf08cb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Nation’s schools strive to teach that our strength comes from people of different races, creeds, and cultures uniting in commitment to the freedom of all. In these cases two school districts in different parts of the country seek to teach that principle by having classrooms that reflect the racial makeup of the surrounding community. That the school districts consider these plans to be necessary should remind us our highest aspirations are yet unfulfilled. But the solutions mandated by these school districts must themselves be lawful. To make race matter now so that it might not matter later may entrench the very prejudices we seek to overcome. In my view the state-mandated racial classifications at issue, official labels proclaiming the race of all persons in a broad class of citizens—elementary school students in one case, high school students in another—are unconstitutional as the cases now come to us.</p>

<p id="fbf08cba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent finds that the school districts have identified a compelling interest in increasing diversity, including for the purpose of avoiding racial isolation. The plurality, by contrast, does not acknowledge that the school districts have identified a compelling interest here. For this reason, among others, I do not join [those parts of the majority opinion]. Diversity, depending on its meaning and definition, is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue.</p>
<p id="fbf08cbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is by way of preface to my respectful submission that parts of the opinion by the Chief Justice imply an all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when, in my view, it may be taken into account. The plurality <span title="783" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-783">p. 783</span>opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate interest government has in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race. The plurality’s postulate that “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” is not sufficient to decide these cases. Fifty years of experience since Brown v. Board of Education (1954) should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution. School districts can seek to reach <i>Brown</i>’s objective of equal educational opportunity. The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion. To the extent the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly mistaken.</p>
<p id="fbf08cbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statement by Justice Harlan that “[o]ur Constitution is color-blind” was most certainly justified in the context of his dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). The Court’s decision in that case was a grievous error it took far too long to overrule. <i>Plessy</i>, of course, concerned official classification by race applicable to all persons who sought to use railway carriages. And, as an aspiration, Justice Harlan’s axiom must command our assent. In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a universal constitutional principle.</p>
<p id="fbf0b3cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition. If school authorities are concerned that the student-body compositions of certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an equal educational opportunity to all of their students, they are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race.</p>
<p id="fbf0b3ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">School boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race. These mechanisms are race conscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would demand strict scrutiny to be found permissible. Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decision-maker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races. Assigning to each student a personal designation according to a crude system of individual racial classifications is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis changes accordingly.</p>

There is every reason to think that, if the dissent’s rationale were accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper exercise of its spending authority or commerce power, could mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County plans nationwide. There seems to be no principled rule, moreover, to limit the dissent’s rationale to the context of public schools.</p>
<p id="fbf0b3d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush aside two concepts of central importance for determining the validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the hurt and adverse consequences resulting from race discrimination. The first is the difference between de jure and de facto segregation; the second, the presumptive invalidity of a State’s use of racial classifications to differentiate its treatment of individuals.</p>
<p id="fbf0b3d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children. A compelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an interest that a school district, in its discretion and expertise, may choose to pursue. Likewise, a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population. Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered. What the government is not permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not made here, is to classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of them to schools based on that classification. Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce children to racial chits valued and traded according to one school’s supply and another’s demand.</p>
<p id="fbf0b3d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision today should not prevent school districts from continuing the important work of bringing together students of different racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. Due to a variety of factors—some influenced by government, some not—neighborhoods in our communities do not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole. Those entrusted with directing our public schools can bring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, administrators, and other concerned citizens to find a way to achieve the compelling interests they face without resorting to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and burdens on the basis of racial classifications.</p>

The first sentence in the concluding paragraph of his opinion states: “Before <i>Brown</i>, schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin.” This sentence reminds me of Anatole France’s observation: “[T]he majestic equality of the la[w], forbid[s] rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.” The Chief Justuce fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools. In this and other ways, the Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court’s most important decisions.</p>

The school board plans before us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools throughout the Nation. All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated education that Brown v. Board of Education (1954) long ago promised—efforts that this Court has repeatedly required, permitted, and encouraged local authorities to undertake. This Court has recognized that the public interests at stake in such cases are “compelling.” We have approved of “narrowly tailored” plans that are no less race-conscious than the plans before us. And we have understood that the Constitution permits local communities to adopt desegregation plans even where it does not require them to do so.</p>

As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong conclusion. In doing so, it distorts precedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation, and it undermines <i>Brown</i>’s promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality. This cannot be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbf0daea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration. More recently, however, progress has stalled. Between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending a school where minority children constituted more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the Nation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed direction by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the Nation (from 57% to 69% in the South). Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the South), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year 2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in the South). As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or over 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools with a white population of less than 1%. Of these, 2.3 million were black and Latino students, and only 72,000 were white. Today, more than one in six black children attend a school that is 99-100% minority. In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, many school districts have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.</p>
<p id="fbf0daeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in myriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often with race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicating earlier school segregation, bringing about integration, or preventing retrogression. Seattle and Louisville are two such districts, and the histories of their present plans set forth typical school integration stories.</p>

<p id="fbf0daee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority tells us that the Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals, even when the Constitution does not compel it. Because of its importance, I shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in <i>Swann</i>. Chief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional importance, wrote: “School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.”</p>
<p id="fbf0daef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally valid the legal principle that <i>Swann</i> enunciated—i.e., that the government may voluntarily adopt race-conscious measures to improve conditions of race even when it is not under a constitutional obligation to do so. That principle has been accepted by every branch of government and is rooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself.</p>
<p id="fbf0daf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is reason to believe that those who drafted an Amendment with this basic purpose in mind would have understood the legal and practical difference between the use of race-conscious criteria in defiance of that purpose, namely to keep the races apart, and the use of race-conscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to bring the races together.</p>
<p id="fbf0daf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to advance or to maintain racial integration in primary and secondary schools. It is a context, as <i>Swann</i> makes clear, where history has required special administrative remedies. And it is a context in which the school boards’ plans simply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of a broad range.</p>
<p id="fbf0daf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This context is not a context that involves the use of race to decide who will receive goods or services that are normally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in short supply. It is not one in which race-conscious limits stigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the races against each other or otherwise significantly exacerbate racial tensions. They do not impose burdens unfairly upon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits for members of all races alike. The context here is one of racial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to bring them together.</p>
<p id="fbf10203-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is altogether fitting. I believe that the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not “strict” in the traditional sense of that word, although it does require the careful review I have just described.</p>

<p id="fbf10207-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify the use of race-based criteria goes by various names. Sometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving racial “diversity.” Other times a court, like the plurality here, refers to it as an interest in racial “balancing.” I have used more general terms to signify that interest, describing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or preserving greater racial “integration” of public schools. By this term, I mean the school districts’ interest in eliminating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the degree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the district’s schools and each individual student’s public school experience.</p>
<p id="fbf10208-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake possesses three essential elements. First, there is a historical and remedial element: an interest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of segregation. This refers back to a time when public schools were highly segregated, often as a result of legal or administrative policies that facilitated racial segregation in public schools. It is an interest in continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by these school-related policies, which have often affected not only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes. It is an interest in maintaining hard-won gains. And it has its roots in preventing what gradually may become the de facto resegregation of America’s public schools.</p>
<p id="fbf10209-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, there is an educational element: an interest in overcoming the adverse educational effects produced by and associated with highly segregated schools. Studies suggest that children taken from those schools and placed in integrated settings often show positive academic gains. Other studies reach different conclusions. See, e.g., D. Armor, Forced Justice (1995). But the evidence supporting an educational interest in racially integrated schools is well established and strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.</p>
<p id="fbf1020a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the “pluralistic society” in which our children will live. It is an interest in helping our children learn to work and play together with children of different racial backgrounds. It is an interest in teaching children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.</p>
<p id="fbf1020b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we are to insist upon unanimity in the social science literature before finding a compelling interest, we might never find one. I believe only that the Constitution allows democratically elected school boards to make up their own minds as to how best to include people of all races in one America.</p>

<p id="fbf1291e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I next ask whether the plans before us are “narrowly tailored” to achieve these “compelling” objectives. I shall not accept the school board’s assurances on faith, and I shall subject the “tailoring” of their plans to “rigorous judicial <span title="788" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-788">p. 788</span>review.” Several factors, taken together, nonetheless lead me to conclude that the boards’ use of race-conscious criteria in these plans passes even the strictest “tailoring” test.</p>
<p id="fbf1291f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set the outer bounds of broad ranges. They constitute but one part of plans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial elements. To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden “quota.” In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater emphasis upon student choice. In Seattle, for example, in more than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines which high schools Seattle’s ninth graders will attend.</p>
<p id="fbf12920-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice plans are less burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored, than other race-conscious restrictions this Court has previously approved. Indeed, the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than the race-conscious admission plans that this Court approved in <i>Grutter</i>. Here, race becomes a factor only in a fraction of students’ non-merit-based assignments—not in large numbers of students’ merit-based applications. Moreover, the effect of applying race-conscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged students less severely, not more severely, than the criteria at issue in <i>Grutter</i>. Disappointed students are not rejected from a State’s flagship graduate program; they simply attend a different one of the district’s many public schools, which in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal. And, in Seattle, the disadvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school of his choice. One will search <i>Grutter</i> in vain for similarly persuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school districts have presented here.</p>
<p id="fbf12921-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the manner in which the school boards developed these plans itself reflects “narrow tailoring.” Each plan was devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools. Each plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation. Each plan is the product of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, while diminishing the need for mandatory busing. And each plan’s use of race-conscious elements is diminished compared to the use of race in preceding integration plans.</p>
<p id="fbf12922-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school boards’ widespread consultation, their experimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-year history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans that are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve the board’s “compelling” objectives. The history of each school system reveals highly segregated schools, followed by remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by efforts to attract or retain students through the use of plans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater student choice. Both cities once tried to achieve more integrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as redrawn district boundaries, new school building construction, and unrestricted voluntary transfers. In neither city did these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the city’s integration goals.</p>
<p id="fbf12923-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school board’s knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these particular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial scrutiny. It simply recognizes that judges are not well suited to act as school administrators. Indeed, in the context of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of acknowledging that local school boards better understand their own communities and have a better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the educational needs of their pupils.</p>
<p id="fbf12924-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor could the school districts have accomplished their desired aims (e.g., avoiding forced busing, countering white flight, maintaining racial diversity) by <span title="789" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-789">p. 789</span>other means. Nothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts over the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court, any reason to believe that another method is possible to accomplish these goals. Nevertheless, Justice Kennedy suggests that school boards: “may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.”</p>
<p id="fbf12925-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, as to “strategic site selection,” Seattle has built one new high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized school serves only 300 students). As to “allocating resources for special programs,” Seattle and Louisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these programs are often referred to as “magnet schools,” but the limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at most to those few schools to which additional resources are granted. In addition, there is no evidence from the experience of these school districts that it will make any meaningful impact. As to “recruiting faculty” on the basis of race, both cities have tried, but only as one part of a broader program. As to “tracking enrollments, performance and other statistics by race,” tracking reveals the problem; it does not cure it.</p>

<p id="fbf12928-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical document that would transmit its basic values to future generations through principles that remained workable over time. Hence it is important to consider the potential consequences of the plurality’s approach, as measured against the Constitution’s objectives. To do so provides further reason to believe that the plurality’s approach is legally unsound.</p>
<p id="fbf12929-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a minimum, the plurality’s views would threaten a surge of race-based litigation. Hundreds of state and federal statutes and regulations use racial classifications for educational or other purposes. In many such instances, the contentious force of legal challenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would displace earlier calm.</p>
<p id="fbf1503a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As I have pointed out, de facto resegregation is on the rise. It is reasonable to conclude that such resegregation can create serious educational, social, and civic problems. Given the conditions in which school boards work to set policy, they may need all of the means presently at their disposal to combat those problems. Yet the plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that some districts now consider vital—the limited use of broad race-conscious student population ranges.</p>
<p id="fbf1503b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I use the words “may need” here deliberately. The plurality, or at least those who follow Justice Thomas’ “‘color-blind’” approach, may feel confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end all governmental use of race- conscious criteria including those with inclusive objectives. By way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems of increasing de facto segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and <span title="790" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-790">p. 790</span>poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation’s children and how best to administer America’s schools to achieve that aim. The Court should leave them to their work. And it is for them to decide, to quote the plurality’s slogan, whether the best “way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws invidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all use of race-conscious criteria.</p>
<p id="fbf1503c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the people, acting through their elected representatives, freedom to select the use of “race-conscious” criteria from among their available options. Today, however, the Court restricts (and some Members would eliminate) that leeway. I fear the consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America’s efforts to create, out of its diversity, one Nation.</p>
<p id="fbf1503d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise of <i>Brown</i>. To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of <i>Brown</i>. The plurality’s position, I fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.</p>

<p id="fbf15040-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No topic in constitutional law is more controversial than affirmative action. In considering affirmative action, three questions are key: First, what level of scrutiny should be used for racial classifications benefiting minorities? Second, what purposes for affirmative action programs are sufficient to meet the level of scrutiny? Third, what techniques of affirmative action are sufficient to meet the level of scrutiny? In reading the cases concerning affirmative action, it is important to focus on how each decision answers these questions.</p>
<p id="fbf15041-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section begins by presenting the initial cases concerning affirmative action, followed by those announcing strict scrutiny as the test for affirmative action programs. Then presented are the recent Supreme Court decisions concerning affirmative action in education and in drawing election district maps.</p>
<p id="fbf15042-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court first considered affirmative action in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). The University of California-Davis Medical School had set aside 16 slots in an entering class of 100 for minority students. The Supreme Court, in a five-to-four decision, without a majority opinion, invalidated the set-aside but ruled that colleges and universities may use race as one factor in admissions decisions to benefit minorities and enhance diversity.</p>
<p id="fbf15043-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Louis Powell, writing on his behalf, said that strict scrutiny should be used for racial classifications benefiting minorities. He concluded that the set-aside failed strict scrutiny but that colleges and universities have a compelling interest in having a diverse student body and that many consider race as one factor in admissions decisions to benefit minorities.</p>
<p id="fbf15044-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice William Brennan, joined by Justices White, Marshall, and Blackmun, argued that intermediate scrutiny should be used for racial classifications <span title="791" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-791">p. 791</span>benefiting minorities. These justices would have upheld the set-aside, as well as the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions.</p>
<p id="fbf15045-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart and Rehnquist, would have invalidated the set-aside and the use of race by colleges and universities as violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title VI prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating based on race.</p>
<p id="fbf17756-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, there was no majority opinion as to the level of scrutiny for racial classifications benefiting minorities. Five justices voted to invalidate the set-aside, one on constitutional grounds and four on statutory grounds. Five justices approved colleges’ and universities’ pursuit of racial diversity by considering race as one factor in admissions decisions.</p>
<p id="fbf17757-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two years after <i>Bakke</i>, in Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), the Supreme Court again considered an affirmative action program but did not produce a majority opinion concerning the appropriate level of scrutiny. The Court upheld a federal law that required that 10 percent of federal public works monies given to local governments be set aside for minority-owned businesses. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, concluded that the affirmative action program was justified to remedy past discrimination but said that the “opinion does not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in cases such as University of California Regents v. Bakke.”</p>
<p id="fbf17758-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three justices—Marshall, Brennan, and Blackmun—concurred in the judgment to uphold the affirmative action program but argued again that intermediate scrutiny should be used for racial classifications serving a remedial purpose. Finally, three justices—Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens—dissented and said that strict scrutiny was the appropriate test. Justice Stewart, joined by Justice Rehnquist, wrote, “Under our Constitution, the government may never act to the detriment of a person solely because of that person’s race. . . . The rule cannot be any different when the persons injured by a racially biased law are not members of a racial minority.”</p>
<p id="fbf17759-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987), the Supreme Court upheld a federal court order that was designed to remedy proven intentional discrimination by the Alabama Department of Public Safety and mandated that a qualified black had to be hired or promoted every time a white was hired or promoted. Justice Brennan, writing for the plurality, found that “the relief ordered survives even strict scrutiny analysis”; “the race-conscious relief at issue here is justified by a compelling interest in remedying the discrimination.”</p>
<p id="fbf1775a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a city’s attempt to achieve faculty diversity in its schools by laying off white teachers with more seniority than black teachers who were retained. The Jackson, Michigan, school system, as part of a settlement to a discrimination suit, hired a number of African American teachers. When layoffs were required, the Board of Education decided that teachers with the most seniority would be retained, except that at no time would the percentage of minorities to be laid off exceed the percentage of minorities employed at the time of the layoffs. The result was that some white teachers were laid off even though they had more seniority than some of the black teachers who kept their jobs.</p>
<p id="fbf1775b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court rejected this as an acceptable means of affirmative action. The Court said that even if prior discrimination was proven, the layoff provision <span title="792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-792">p. 792</span>was not a constitutionally acceptable means of achieving even the compelling purpose of remedying prior discrimination. Justice Powell, writing for the plurality, said that “as a means of accomplishing purposes that otherwise may be legitimate, the Board’s layoff plan is not sufficiently narrowly tailored. Other, less intrusive means of accomplishing similar purposes—such as the adoption of hiring goals—are available.”</p>
<p id="fbf1775c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Powell expressly rejected the government’s justifications for affirmative action: remedying past discrimination and providing role models for students. He wrote, “This Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification. Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.” Justice Powell also wrote, “The role model theory allows the Board to engage in discriminatory hiring and layoff practices long past the point required by any legitimate remedial purpose. . . . Moreover, because the role model theory does not necessarily bear a relationship to the harm caused by prior discriminatory hiring practices, it actually could be used to escape the obligation to remedy such practices by justifying the small percentage of black teachers by reference to the small percentage of black students.”</p>

<p id="fbf19e78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 11, 1983, the Richmond City Council adopted the Minority Business Utilization Plan (the Plan). The Plan required prime contractors to whom the city awarded construction contracts to subcontract at least 30% of the dollar amount of the contract to one or more Minority Business Enterprises (MBE’s). <span title="793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-793">p. 793</span>The 30% set-aside did not apply to city contracts awarded to minority-owned prime contractors. The Plan defined an MBE as “[a] business at least fifty-one (51) percent of which is owned and controlled . . . by minority group members.” “Minority group members” were defined as “[c]itizens of the United States who are Blacks, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts.” There was no geographic limit to the Plan; an otherwise qualified MBE from anywhere in the United States could avail itself of the 30% set-aside. The Plan declared that it was “remedial” in nature, and enacted “for the purpose of promoting wider participation by minority business enterprises in the construction of public projects.” The Plan expired on June 30, 1988, and was in effect for approximately five years.</p>
<p id="fbf19e79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Plan was adopted by the Richmond City Council after a public hearing. Proponents of the set-aside provision relied on a study which indicated that, while the general population of Richmond was 50% black, only 0.67% of the city’s prime construction contracts had been awarded to minority businesses in the 5-year period from 1978 to 1983. It was also established that a variety of contractors’ associations, whose representatives appeared in opposition to the ordinance, had virtually no minority businesses within their membership. There was no direct evidence of race discrimination on the part of the city in letting contracts or any evidence that the city’s prime contractors had discriminated against minority-owned subcontractors.</p>

<p id="fbf19e7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would seem clear that a state or local subdivision (if delegated the authority from the State) has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction. This authority must, of course, be exercised within the constraints of §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a matter of state law, the city of Richmond has legislative authority over its procurement policies, and can use its spending powers to remedy private discrimination, if it identifies that discrimination with the particularity required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, if the city could show that it had essentially become a “passive participant” in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry, we think it clear that the city could take affirmative steps to dismantle such a system. It is beyond dispute that any public entity, state or federal, has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens, do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.</p>

<p id="fbf1c58e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Richmond Plan denies certain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely upon their race. To whatever racial group these citizens belong, their “personal rights” to be treated with equal dignity and respect are implicated by a rigid rule erecting race as the sole criterion in an aspect of public decisionmaking.</p>
<p id="fbf1c58f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="794" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-794">p. 794</span>Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are “benign” or “remedial” and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to “smoke out” illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen “fit” this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype. Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility.</p>
<p id="fbf1c590-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even were we to accept a reading of the guarantee of equal protection under which the level of scrutiny varies according to the ability of different groups to defend their interests in the representative process, heightened scrutiny would still be appropriate in the circumstances of this case. One of the central arguments for applying a less exacting standard to “benign” racial classifications is that such measures essentially involve a choice made by dominant racial groups to disadvantage themselves. If one aspect of the judiciary’s role under the Equal Protection Clause is to protect “discrete and insular minorities” from majoritarian prejudice or indifference, see United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), some maintain that these concerns are not implicated when the “white majority” places burdens upon itself. See J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 170 (1980).</p>
<p id="fbf1c591-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, blacks constitute approximately 50% of the population of the city of Richmond. Five of the nine seats on the city council are held by blacks. The concern that a political majority will more easily act to the disadvantage of a minority based on unwarranted assumptions or incomplete facts would seem to militate for, not against, the application of heightened judicial scrutiny in this case.</p>

<p id="fbf1c593-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found the city council’s “findings sufficient to ensure that, in adopting the Plan, it was remedying the present effects of past discrimination in the construction industry.” Like the “role model” theory employed in <i>Wygant</i>, a generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. It “has no logical stopping point.” “Relief” for such an ill-defined wrong could extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded to MBE’s in Richmond mirrored the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole.</p>
<p id="fbf40f84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant argues that it is attempting to remedy various forms of past discrimination that are alleged to be responsible for the small number of minority businesses in the local contracting industry. Among these the city cites the exclusion of blacks from skilled construction trade unions and training programs.</p>
<p id="fbf40f85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While there is no doubt that the sorry history of both private and public discrimination in this country has contributed to a lack of opportunities for black entrepreneurs, this observation, standing alone, cannot justify a rigid racial quota in the awarding of public contracts in Richmond, Virginia. Like the claim that discrimination in primary and secondary schooling justifies a rigid racial <span title="795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-795">p. 795</span>preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota.</p>
<p id="fbf40f86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is sheer speculation how many minority firms there would be in Richmond absent past societal discrimination, just as it was sheer speculation how many minority medical students would have been admitted to the medical school at Davis absent past discrimination in educational opportunities. Defining these sorts of injuries as “identified discrimination” would give local governments license to create a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations about any particular field of endeavor.</p>
<p id="fbf40f87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These defects are readily apparent in this case. The 30% quota cannot in any realistic sense be tied to any injury suffered by anyone. None of [the district court’s] “findings,” singly or together, provide the city of Richmond with a “strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.” There is nothing approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by anyone in the Richmond construction industry.</p>
<p id="fbf40f88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court accorded great weight to the fact that the city council designated the Plan as “remedial.” But the mere recitation of a “benign” or legitimate purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no weight. Racial classifications are suspect, and that means that simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot suffice.</p>
<p id="fbf40f89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, none of the evidence presented by the city points to any identified discrimination in the Richmond construction industry. We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. To accept Richmond’s claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for “remedial relief” for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. “Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups. Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications. . . .” We think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.</p>
<p id="fbf40f8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing analysis applies only to the inclusion of blacks within the Richmond set-aside program. There is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against Spanish-speaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut persons in any aspect of the Richmond construction industry. It may well be that Richmond has never had an Aleut or Eskimo citizen. The random inclusion of racial groups that, as a practical matter, may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry in Richmond suggests that perhaps the city’s purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbf40f8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a 30% set-aside was “narrowly tailored” to compensate black contractors for past discrimination, one may legitimately ask why they are forced to share this “remedial relief” with an Aleut citizen who moves to Richmond tomorrow? The gross overinclusiveness of Richmond’s racial preference strongly impugns the city’s claim of remedial motivation.</p>

<p id="fbf40f8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted by the court below, it is almost impossible to assess whether the Richmond Plan is narrowly tailored to remedy prior discrimination since it is not linked to identified discrimination in any way. We limit ourselves to two observations in this regard.</p>
<p id="fbf4369e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, there does not appear to have been any consideration of the use of race-neutral means to increase minority business participation in city contracting. Many of the barriers to minority participation in the construction industry relied upon by the city to justify a racial classification appear to be race neutral. If MBE’s disproportionately lack capital or cannot meet bonding requirements, a race-neutral program of city financing for small firms would, a fortiori, lead to greater minority participation. There is no evidence in this record that the Richmond City Council has considered any alternatives to a race-based quota.</p>
<p id="fbf4369f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the 30% quota cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright racial balancing. It rests upon the “completely unrealistic” assumption that minorities will choose a particular trade in lockstep proportion to their representation in the local population. Since the city must already consider bids and waivers on a case-by-case basis, it is difficult to see the need for a rigid numerical quota.</p>

<p id="fbf436a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing we say today precludes a state or local entity from taking action to rectify the effects of identified discrimination within its jurisdiction. If the city of Richmond had evidence before it that nonminority contractors were systematically excluding minority businesses from subcontracting opportunities it could take action to end the discriminatory exclusion. Where there is a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged by the locality or the locality’s prime contractors, an inference of discriminatory exclusion could arise. Under such circumstances, the city could act to dismantle the closed business system by taking appropriate measures against those who discriminate on the basis of race or other illegitimate criteria. In the extreme case, some form of narrowly tailored racial preference might be necessary to break down patterns of deliberate exclusion.</p>
<p id="fbf436a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the absence of evidence of discrimination, the city has at its disposal a whole array of race-neutral devices to increase the accessibility of city contracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races. Simplification of bidding procedures, relaxation of bonding requirements, and training and financial aid for disadvantaged entrepreneurs of all races would open the public contracting market to all those who have suffered the effects of past societal discrimination or neglect. Many of the formal barriers to new entrants may be the product of bureaucratic inertia more than actual necessity, and may have a disproportionate effect on the opportunities open to new minority firms. Their elimination or modification would have little detrimental effect on the city’s interests and would serve to increase the opportunities available to minority business without classifying individuals on the basis of race. The city may also act to prohibit <span title="797" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-797">p. 797</span>discrimination in the provision of credit or bonding by local suppliers and banks. Business as usual should not mean business pursuant to the unthinking exclusion of certain members of our society from its rewards.</p>
<p id="fbf436a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at hand, the city has not ascertained how many minority enterprises are present in the local construction market nor the level of their participation in city construction projects. The city points to no evidence that qualified minority contractors have been passed over for city contracts or subcontracts, either as a group or in any individual case. Under such circumstances, it is simply impossible to say that the city has demonstrated “a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.”</p>
<p id="fbf436a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proper findings in this regard are necessary to define both the scope of the injury and the extent of the remedy necessary to cure its effects. Such findings also serve to assure all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself. Absent such findings, there is a danger that a racial classification is merely the product of unthinking stereotypes or a form of racial politics. “[I]f there is no duty to attempt either to measure the recovery by the wrong or to distribute that recovery within the injured class in an evenhanded way, our history will adequately support a legislative preference for almost any ethnic, religious, or racial group with the political strength to negotiate ‘a piece of the action’ for its members.” Because the city of Richmond has failed to identify the need for remedial action in the awarding of its public construction contracts, its treatment of its citizens on a racial basis violates the dictates of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fbf436a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fbf436a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with much of the Court’s opinion, and, in particular, with Justice O’Connor’s conclusion that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race, whether or not its asserted purpose is “remedial” or “benign.” I do not agree, however, with Justice O’Connor’s dictum suggesting that, despite the Fourteenth Amendment, state and local governments may in some circumstances discriminate on the basis of race in order (in a broad sense) “to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination.” The benign purpose of compensating for social disadvantages, whether they have been acquired by reason of prior discrimination or otherwise, can no more be pursued by the illegitimate means of racial discrimination than can other assertedly benign purposes we have repeatedly rejected.</p>
<p id="fbf436a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I share the view expressed by Alexander Bickel that “[t]he lesson of the great decisions of the Supreme Court and the lesson of contemporary history have been the same for at least a generation: discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic society.” A. Bickel, The Morality of Consent 133 (1975). At least where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb—for example, a prison race riot, requiring temporary segregation of inmates, can justify an exception to the principle embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment that “[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.”</p>
<p id="fbf45cb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view there is only one circumstance in which the States may act by race to “undo the effects of past discrimination”: where that is necessary to <span title="798" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-798">p. 798</span>eliminate their own maintenance of a system of unlawful racial classification. If, for example, a state agency has a discriminatory pay scale compensating black employees in all positions at 20% less than their nonblack counterparts, it may assuredly promulgate an order raising the salaries of “all black employees” to eliminate the differential. This distinction explains our school desegregation cases, in which we have made plain that States and localities sometimes have an obligation to adopt race-conscious remedies.</p>
<p id="fbf45cb9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf45cba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a welcome symbol of racial progress when the former capital of the Confederacy acts forthrightly to confront the effects of racial discrimination in its midst. In my view, nothing in the Constitution can be construed to prevent Richmond, Virginia, from allocating a portion of its contracting dollars for businesses owned or controlled by members of minority groups. Indeed, Richmond’s set-aside program is indistinguishable in all meaningful respects from— and in fact was patterned upon—the federal set-aside plan which this Court upheld in Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980).</p>
<p id="fbf45cbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A majority of this Court holds today, however, that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment blocks Richmond’s initiative. The essence of the majority’s position is that Richmond has failed to catalog adequate findings to prove that past discrimination has impeded minorities from joining or participating fully in Richmond’s construction contracting industry. I find deep irony in second-guessing Richmond’s judgment on this point. As much as any municipality in the United States, Richmond knows what racial discrimination is; a century of decisions by this and other federal courts has richly documented the city’s disgraceful history of public and private racial discrimination. In any event, the Richmond City Council has supported its determination that minorities have been wrongly excluded from local construction contracting. Its proof includes statistics showing that minority-owned businesses have received virtually no city contracting dollars and rarely if ever belonged to area trade associations; testimony by municipal officials that discrimination has been widespread in the local construction industry; and the same exhaustive and widely publicized federal studies relied on in <i>Fullilove</i>, studies which showed that pervasive discrimination in the Nation’s tight-knit construction industry had operated to exclude minorities from public contracting. These are precisely the types of statistical and testimonial evidence which, until today, this Court had credited in cases approving of race-conscious measures designed to remedy past discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbf45cbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More fundamentally, today’s decision marks a deliberate and giant step backward in this Court’s affirmative-action jurisprudence. Cynical of one municipality’s attempt to redress the effects of past racial discrimination in a particular industry, the majority launches a grapeshot attack on race-conscious remedies in general. The majority’s unnecessary pronouncements will inevitably discourage or prevent governmental entities, particularly States and localities, from acting to rectify the scourge of past discrimination. This is the harsh reality of the majority’s decision, but it is not the Constitution’s command.</p>
<p id="fbf45cbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, for the first time, a majority of this Court has adopted strict scrutiny as its standard of Equal Protection Clause review of race-conscious remedial measures. This is an unwelcome development. A profound difference separates <span title="799" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-799">p. 799</span>governmental actions that themselves are racist, and governmental actions that seek to remedy the effects of prior racism or to prevent neutral governmental activity from perpetuating the effects of such racism. Racial classifications “drawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government behind racial hatred and separatism” warrant the strictest judicial scrutiny because of the very irrelevance of these rationales. By contrast, racial classifications drawn for the purpose of remedying the effects of discrimination that itself was race based have a highly pertinent basis: the tragic and indelible fact that discrimination against blacks and other racial minorities in this Nation has pervaded our Nation’s history and continues to scar our society.</p>
<p id="fbf45cbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In concluding that remedial classifications warrant no different standard of review under the Constitution than the most brutal and repugnant forms of state-sponsored racism, a majority of this Court signals that it regards racial discrimination as largely a phenomenon of the past, and that government bodies need no longer preoccupy themselves with rectifying racial injustice. I, however, do not believe this Nation is anywhere close to eradicating racial discrimination or its vestiges. In constitutionalizing its wishful thinking, the majority today does a grave disservice not only to those victims of past and present racial discrimination in this Nation whom government has sought to assist, but also to this Court’s long tradition of approaching issues of race with the utmost sensitivity.</p>

<p id="fbf45cbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A year after <i>Croson</i>, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), the Supreme Court held that congressionally approved affirmative action programs only need to meet intermediate scrutiny. The Supreme Court, in a five-to-four decision, upheld FCC policies that gave a preference to minority-owned businesses in broadcast licensing. The majority opinion expressly said, “We hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress—even if those measure[s] are not ‘remedial’ in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination—are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”</p>
<p id="fbf45cc0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority opinion in <i>Metro Broadcasting</i> was written by Justice Brennan and joined by Justices White, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens. The dissent comprised Justices O’Connor, Kennedy, Scalia, and Rehnquist. Between <i>Metro Broadcasting</i>, in 1990, and Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), four of the justices in the majority, but none of the justices in the dissent, resigned. In <i>Adarand</i>, the four dissenters from <i>Metro Broadcasting</i> were joined by Justice Thomas to create a majority that overruled <i>Metro Broadcasting</i>.</p>
<p id="fbf483d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor, writing for the Court, stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbf483d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests. To the extent that <i>Metro Broadcasting</i> is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled.</p>
<p id="fbf483d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="800" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-800">p. 800</span>Our action today makes explicit what Justice Powell thought implicit in the <i>Fullilove</i> lead opinion: Federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest. Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that <i>Fullilove</i> held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in <i>Fullilove</i> would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.</p>
<p id="fbf483d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety’s “pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct” justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy. See United States v. Paradise. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the “narrow tailoring” test this Court has set out in previous cases.</p>
</div>

<p id="fbf483d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court remanded the case for the application of strict scrutiny. Justice Scalia wrote separately to express his view that remedying past discrimination can virtually never meet strict scrutiny:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbf483d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the opinion of the Court except insofar as it may be inconsistent with the following: In my view, government can never have a “compelling interest” in discriminating on the basis of race in order to “make up” for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction. Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. That concept is alien to the Constitution’s focus upon the individual. To pursue the concept of racial entitlement—even for the most admirable and benign of purposes—is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.</p>
<p id="fbf483d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is unlikely, if not impossible, that the challenged program would survive under this understanding of strict scrutiny, but I am content to leave that to be decided on remand.</p>
</div>

<p id="fbf483d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Thomas took a similar position:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbf483d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the majority’s conclusion that strict scrutiny applies to all government classifications based on race. I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the premise underlying Justice Stevens’s and Justice Ginsburg’s dissents: that there is a racial paternalism exception to the principle of equal protection. I believe that there is a “moral [and] constitutional equivalence,” between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law.</p>
<p id="fbf483da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race. As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government’s racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged. There can be no doubt that the paternalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program is at war with the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution. See Declaration of <span title="801" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-801">p. 801</span>Independence (“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness”).</p>
<p id="fbf483db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These programs not only raise grave constitutional questions, they also undermine the moral basis of the equal protection principle. Purchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, the equal protection principle reflects our Nation’s understanding that such classifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the individual and our society. Unquestionably, “[i]nvidious [racial] discrimination is an engine of oppression.” It is also true that “[r]emedial” racial preferences may reflect “a desire to foster equality in society.” But there can be no doubt that racial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination. So-called “benign” discrimination teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps, minorities cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence. Inevitably, such programs engender attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government’s use of race. These programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are “entitled” to preferences.</p>
<p id="fbf483dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice. In each instance, it is racial discrimination, plain and simple.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbf483dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens wrote for the dissent:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbf483de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead of deciding this case in accordance with controlling precedent, the Court today delivers a disconcerting lecture about the evils of governmental racial classifications. The Court’s concept of “consistency” assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the majority to impose a special burden on the members of a minority race and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to certain members of that minority notwithstanding its incidental burden on some members of the majority. In my opinion that assumption is untenable. There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination. Invidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority. Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society. No sensible conception of the Government’s constitutional obligation to “govern impartially,” should ignore this distinction.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The consistency that the Court espouses would disregard the difference between a “No Trespassing” sign and a welcome mat. It would treat a Dixiecrat Senator’s decision to vote against Thurgood Marshall’s confirmation in order to keep African-Americans off the Supreme Court as on a par with President Johnson’s evaluation of his nominee’s race as a positive factor. It would equate a law that made black citizens ineligible for military service with a program aimed at recruiting black soldiers. An attempt by the majority to exclude members of a minority race from a regulated market is fundamentally different from a subsidy that enables a relatively small group of newcomers to enter that market. An interest in “consistency” does not justify treating differences as though they were similarities.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s explanation for treating dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable is a supposed inability to differentiate between “invidious” and “benign” discrimination. But the term “affirmative action” is common and well understood. Its presence in everyday parlance shows that people understand the difference between good intentions and bad. As with any legal concept, some cases may be difficult to classify, but our equal protection jurisprudence <span title="802" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-802">p. 802</span>has identified a critical difference between state action that imposes burdens on a disfavored few and state action that benefits the few “in spite of” its adverse effects on the many.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, a decision by representatives of the majority to discriminate against the members of a minority race is fundamentally different from those same representatives’ decision to impose incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in order to provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional reason for giving greater deference to the National Legislature than to a local lawmaking body is that federal affirmative-action programs represent the will of our entire Nation’s elected representatives, whereas a state or local program may have an impact on nonresident entities who played no part in the decision to enact it. Thus, in the state or local context, individuals who were unable to vote for the local representatives who enacted a race-conscious program may nonetheless feel the effects of that program.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ironically, after all of the time, effort, and paper this Court has expended in differentiating between federal and state affirmative action, the majority today virtually ignores the issue. It provides not a word of direct explanation for its sudden and enormous departure from the reasoning in past cases. Such silence, however, cannot erase the difference between Congress’ institutional competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic racial subjugation and the States’ lesser power to do so. In my judgment, the Court’s novel doctrine of “congruence” is seriously misguided. Congressional deliberations about a matter as important as affirmative action should be accorded far greater deference than those of a State or municipality.</p>

Justice Thomas, in <i>Adarand</i> above, espoused this view: “In my mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice. In each instance, it is racial discrimination, plain and simple.” The view is that the Constitution requires that the government treat each person as an individual without regard to his or her race; strict scrutiny is used to ensure that this occurs.</p>
<p id="fbf4aaf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, supporters of strict scrutiny for affirmative action argue that all racial classifications stigmatize and breed racial hostility, and therefore all should be subjected to strict scrutiny. Justice O’Connor, in <i>Croson</i>, stated, “Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility.” Professor Michael Perry made a similar point that affirmative action “inevitably foments racial resentment and thereby strains the effort to gain wider acceptance for the principle of the moral equality of the races.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1167A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1167A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">93</a></span></p>

There is a long history of racism and discrimination against minorities but no similar history of persecution of whites.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11687_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11687_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">94</a></span> Those who argue for a lower level of scrutiny for judicial review of affirmative action programs also emphasize that achieving social equality requires affirmative action at this point in American history. The tremendous continuing disparities between blacks and whites in areas such as education, employment, and public contracting necessitate remedial action. Applying strict scrutiny would greatly impede such remedial efforts because relatively few affirmative action programs have survived this rigorous review.</p>
<p id="fbf4d20c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also it is argued that there is a major difference between a majority discriminating against a minority and the majority discriminating against itself. Professor John Hart Ely explained, “When the group that controls the decision making process classifies so as to advantage a minority and disadvantage itself, the reasons for being unusually suspicious, and consequently, employing a stringent brand of review are lacking. A White majority is unlikely to disadvantage itself for reasons of racial prejudice; nor is it likely to be tempted either to underestimate the needs and deserts of Whites relative to those of others, or to overestimate the costs of devising an alternative classification that would extend to certain Whites the advantages generally extended to Blacks.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11694_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11694_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">95</a></span></p>

<p id="fbf4f92a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School ranks among the Nation’s top law schools. It receives more than 3,500 applications each year for a class of around 350 students. Seeking to “admit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable,” the Law School looks for individuals with “substantial promise for success in law school” and “a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-being of others.” More broadly, the Law School seeks “a mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each other.” In 1992, the dean of the Law School charged a faculty committee with crafting a written admissions policy to implement these goals. In particular, the Law School sought to ensure that its efforts to achieve student body diversity complied with this Court’s most recent ruling on the use of race in university admissions. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke (1978). Upon the unanimous adoption of the committee’s report by the Law School faculty, it became the Law School’s official admissions policy.</p>
<p id="fbf4f92b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants’ talents, experiences, and potential “to contribute to the learning of those around them.” The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School. In reviewing an applicant’s file, admissions officials must consider the applicant’s undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school. The policy stresses that “no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.”</p>
<p id="fbf4f92c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law School. Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant. Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are important to the Law School’s educational objectives. So-called “‘soft’ variables” such as “the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant’s essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection” are all brought to bear in assessing an “applicant’s likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.”</p>
<p id="fbf4f92d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy aspires to “achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone’s education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.” The policy does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for “substantial weight” in the admissions process, but instead recognizes “many possible bases for diversity admissions.” The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School’s longstanding commitment to “one particular type of diversity,” that is, “racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers.” By enrolling a “‘critical mass’ of [underrepresented] minority students,” the <span title="805" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-805">p. 805</span>Law School seeks to “ensur[e] their ability to make unique contributions to the character of the Law School.”</p>
<p id="fbf4f92e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy does not define diversity “solely in terms of racial and ethnic status.” Nor is the policy “insensitive to the competition among all students for admission to the [L]aw [S]chool.” Rather, the policy seeks to guide admissions officers in “producing classes both diverse and academically outstanding, classes made up of students who promise to continue the tradition of outstanding contribution by Michigan Graduates to the legal profession.”</p>

<p id="fbf52043-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago. In the landmark <i>Bakke</i> case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court. Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to “remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.” Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds. Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for reversing the state court’s injunction against any use of race whatsoever. Since this Court’s splintered decision in <i>Bakke</i>, Justice Powell’s opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powell’s views on permissible race-conscious policies.</p>
<p id="fbf52044-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not find it necessary to decide whether Justice Powell’s opinion is binding. More important, for the reasons set out below, today we endorse Justice Powell’s view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbf52046-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Because the Fourteenth Amendment “protect[s] persons, not groups,” all “governmental action based on race—a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited—should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.” We have held that all racial classifications imposed by government “must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” This means that such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further <span title="806" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-806">p. 806</span>compelling governmental interests. “Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures,” we have no way to determine what “classifications are ‘benign’ or ‘remedial’ and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.” We apply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to “‘smoke out’ illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.”</p>
<p id="fbf52047-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Strict scrutiny is not “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.</p>

<p id="fbf5204a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law School’s use of race is justified by a compelling state interest. Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining “the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.” In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.</p>
<p id="fbf5204b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School’s educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer. The Law School’s assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university. Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university’s academic decisions, within constitutionally prescribed limits. We have long recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition. In announcing the principle of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice Powell invoked our cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational autonomy. Our conclusion that the Law School has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School’s proper institutional mission, and that “good faith” on the part of a university is “presumed” absent “a showing to the contrary.”</p>
<p id="fbf5204c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of its goal of “assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse,” the Law School seeks to “enroll a ‘critical mass’ of minority students.” The Law School’s interest is not simply “to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.” That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional. Rather, the Law School’s concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.</p>
<p id="fbf5204d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="807" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-807">p. 807</span>These benefits are substantial. As the District Court emphasized, the Law School’s admissions policy promotes “cross-racial understanding,” helps to break down racial stereotypes, and “enables [students] to better understand persons of different races.” These benefits are “important and laudable,” because “classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting” when the students have “the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.”</p>
<p id="fbf5204e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School’s claim of a compelling interest is further bolstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity. In addition to the expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and “better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals.” These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, “[b]ased on [their] decades of experience,” a “highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential to the military’s ability to fulfill its principle [sic] mission to provide national security.”</p>
<p id="fbf5204f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to “sustaining our political and cultural heritage” with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society. Plyler v. Doe (1982). This Court has long recognized that “education . . . is the very foundation of good citizenship.” Brown v. Board of Education (1954). For this reason, the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United States, as amicus curiae, affirms that “[e]nsuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.” And, “[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context of higher education.” Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.</p>
<p id="fbf52050-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation’s leaders. Individuals with law degrees occupy roughly half the state governorships, more than half the seats in the United States Senate, and more than a third of the seats in the United States House of Representatives. The pattern is even more striking when it comes to highly selective law schools. A handful of these schools accounts for 25 of the 100 United States Senators, 74 United States Courts of Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of the more than 600 United States District Court judges.</p>
<p id="fbf54761-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America.</p>
<p id="fbf54762-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-808">p. 808</span>The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on “any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.” To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School’s mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual’s views, so too is one’s own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters. The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a “critical mass” of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.</p>

<p id="fbf54764-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to further a compelling state interest, government is still “constrained in how it may pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.” The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensure that “the means chosen ‘fit’ . . . th[e] compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.”</p>
<p id="fbf54765-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since <i>Bakke</i>, we have had no occasion to define the contours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs. That inquiry must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student body diversity in public higher education. Contrary to Justice Kennedy’s assertions, we do not “abandon[] strict scrutiny.” Rather, as we have already explained, we adhere to <i>Adarand</i>’s teaching that the very purpose of strict scrutiny is to take such “relevant differences into account.”</p>
<p id="fbf54766-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system—it cannot “insulat[e] each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.” Instead, a university may consider race or ethnicity only as a “‘plus’ in a particular applicant’s file,” without “insulat[ing] the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.” In other words, an admissions program must be “flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.”</p>
<p id="fbf54767-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the Law School’s admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in <i>Bakke</i>, truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonmechanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. Nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Universities can, however, consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a “plus” factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant.</p>
<p id="fbf54768-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are satisfied that the Law School’s admissions program, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell, does not operate as a quota. Properly <span title="809" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-809">p. 809</span>understood, a “quota” is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are “reserved exclusively for certain minority groups.” Quotas “‘impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded,’” and “insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.” In contrast, “a permissible goal . . . require[s] only a good-faith effort . . . to come within a range demarcated by the goal itself,” and permits consideration of race as a “plus” factor in any given case while still ensuring that each candidate “compete[s] with all other qualified applicants.”</p>
<p id="fbf54769-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School’s goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota. As the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell recognized, there is of course “some relationship between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted.” “[S]ome attention to numbers,” without more, does not transform a flexible admissions system into a rigid quota. Moreover, between 1993 and 2000, the number of African-American, Latino, and Native-American students in each class at the Law School varied from 13.5 to 20.1 percent, a range inconsistent with a quota.</p>
<p id="fbf5476a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in <i>Bakke</i>, the Law School’s race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions. With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified. By virtue of our Nation’s struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law School’s mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.</p>
<p id="fbf5476b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity. To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear “[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions,” and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields. The Law School seriously considers each “applicant’s promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic—e.g., an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.” All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.</p>
<p id="fbf5476c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race. The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well. By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as <span title="810" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-810">p. 810</span>well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body. Justice Kennedy speculates that “race is likely outcome determinative for many members of minority groups” who do not fall within the upper range of LSAT scores and grades. But the same could be said of the Harvard plan discussed approvingly by Justice Powell in <i>Bakke</i>, and indeed of any plan that uses race as one of many factors.</p>
<p id="fbf5476d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives. The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as “using a lottery system” or “decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.” But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both. The Law School’s current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race. Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity. So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.</p>
<p id="fbf5476e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States advocates “percentage plans,” recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State. The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools. Moreover, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university. We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.</p>
<p id="fbf5476f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are mindful, however, that “[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.” Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands. Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle. We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.</p>
<p id="fbf54770-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a termination point “assure[s] all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.” It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased. We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.</p>

Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the country’s finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions. As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated. From today’s vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generation’s span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.</p>

What I ask for the negro is not benevolence, not pity, not sympathy, but simply justice. The American people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us. . . . I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! . . . And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone! . . . [Y]our interference is doing him positive injury.”</p>
<p id="fbf56e89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators. Because I wish to see all students succeed whatever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of Michigan Law School (Law School). The Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devotion to the status quo in admissions policies when such devotion ripens into racial discrimination. Nor does the Constitution countenance the unprecedented deference the Court gives to the Law School, an approach inconsistent with the very concept of “strict scrutiny.”</p>

Similarly, a university may not maintain a high admission standard and grant exemptions to favored races. The Law School, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy.</p>
<p id="fbf56e8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority upholds the Law School’s racial discrimination not by interpreting the people’s Constitution, but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti. Nevertheless, I concur in part in the Court’s opinion. First, I agree with the Court insofar as its decision, which approves of only one racial classification, confirms that further use of race in admissions remains unlawful. Second, I agree with the Court’s holding that racial discrimination in higher education admissions will be illegal in 25 years. I respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court’s opinion and the judgment, however, because I believe that the Law School’s current use of race violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution means the same thing today as it will in 300 months.</p>

<p id="fbf56e8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the majority, I seek to define with precision the interest being asserted by the Law School before determining whether that interest is so compelling as to justify racial discrimination. The Law School maintains that it wishes to obtain “educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.” This statement must be evaluated carefully, because it implies that both “diversity” and “educational benefits” are components of the Law School’s compelling state interest. Additionally, the Law School’s refusal to entertain certain changes in its admissions process and status indicates that the compelling state interest it seeks to validate is actually broader than might appear at first glance.</p>
<p id="fbf56e8e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undoubtedly there are other ways to “better” the education of law students aside from ensuring that the student body contains a “critical mass” of underrepresented minority students. Attaining “diversity,” whatever it means, is the mechanism by which the Law School obtains educational benefits, not an end of itself. The Law School, however, apparently believes that only a racially mixed student body can lead to the educational benefits it seeks. How, then, is the Law School’s interest in these allegedly unique educational “benefits” not simply the forbidden interest in “racial balancing,” that the majority expressly rejects?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11809_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11809_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">96</a></span></p>

The Law School’s argument, as facile as it is, can only be understood in one way: Classroom aesthetics yields educational benefits, racially discriminatory admissions policies are required to achieve the right racial mix, and therefore the policies are required to achieve the educational benefits. It is the educational benefits that are the end, or allegedly compelling state interest, not “diversity.” One must also consider the Law School’s refusal to entertain changes to its current admissions system that might produce the same educational benefits. The Law School adamantly disclaims any race-neutral alternative that would reduce “academic selectivity,” which would in turn “require the Law School to become a very different institution, and to sacrifice a core part of its educational mission.” In other words, the Law School seeks to improve marginally the education it offers without sacrificing too much of its exclusivity and elite status.</p>
<p id="fbf56e91-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proffered interest that the majority vindicates today, then, is not simply “diversity.” Instead the Court upholds the use of racial discrimination as a tool to advance the Law School’s interest in offering a marginally superior education while maintaining an elite institution. Unless each constituent part of this state interest is of pressing public necessity, the Law School’s use of race is unconstitutional. I find each of them to fall far short of this standard.</p>

<p id="fbf56e93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A close reading of the Court’s opinion reveals that all of its legal work is done through one conclusory statement: The Law School has a “compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.” No serious effort is made to explain how these benefits fit with the state interests the Court has recognized (or rejected) as compelling, or to place any theoretical constraints on an enterprising court’s desire to discover still more justifications for racial discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbf56e94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the proper standard, there is no pressing public necessity in maintaining a public law school at all and, it follows, certainly not an elite law school. Likewise, marginal improvements in legal education do not qualify as a compelling state interest.</p>
<p id="fbf56e95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While legal education at a public university may be good policy or otherwise laudable, it is obviously not a pressing public necessity when the correct legal standard is applied. Michigan has no compelling interest in having a law school at all, much less an elite one. Still, even assuming that a State may, under appropriate circumstances, demonstrate a cognizable interest in having an elite law school, Michigan has failed to do so here.</p>
<p id="fbf56e96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has limited the scope of equal protection review to interests and activities that occur within that State’s jurisdiction. The Law School today, however, does precious little training of those attorneys who will serve the citizens of Michigan. In 2002, graduates of the University of Michigan Law School made up less than 6% of applicants to the Michigan bar, even though the Law School’s graduates constitute nearly 30% of all law students graduating in Michigan. Less than 16% of the Law School’s graduating class elects to stay in Michigan after law school. Thus, while a mere 27% of the Law School’s 2002 entering class are <span title="814" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-814">p. 814</span>from Michigan, only half of these, it appears, will stay in Michigan. In sum, the Law School trains few Michigan residents and overwhelmingly serves students, who, as lawyers, leave the State of Michigan. By contrast, Michigan’s other public law school, Wayne State University Law School, sends 88% of its graduates on to serve the people of Michigan. It does not take a social scientist to conclude that it is precisely the Law School’s status as an elite institution that causes it to be a waystation for the rest of the country’s lawyers, rather than a training ground for those who will remain in Michigan. The Law School’s decision to be an elite institution does little to advance the welfare of the people of Michigan or any cognizable interest of the State of Michigan.</p>
<p id="fbf595a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even if the Law School’s racial tinkering produces tangible educational benefits, a marginal improvement in legal education cannot justify racial discrimination where the Law School has no compelling interest in either its existence or in its current educational and admissions policies.</p>

<p id="fbf595a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The interest in remaining elite and exclusive that the majority thinks so obviously critical requires the use of admissions “standards” that, in turn, create the Law School’s “need” to discriminate on the basis of race. The Court validates these admissions standards by concluding that alternatives that would require “a dramatic sacrifice of . . . the academic quality of all admitted students,” need not be considered before racial discrimination can be employed. In the majority’s view, such methods are not required by the “narrow tailoring” prong of strict scrutiny because that inquiry demands, in this context, that any race-neutral alternative work “‘about as well.’” The majority errs, however, because race-neutral alternatives must only be “workable,” and do “about as well” in vindicating the compelling state interest. The Court never explicitly holds that the Law School’s desire to retain the status quo in “academic selectivity” is itself a compelling state interest, and, as I have demonstrated, it is not. Therefore, the Law School should be forced to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admissions system—it cannot have it both ways.</p>
<p id="fbf595aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the adoption of different admissions methods, such as accepting all students who meet minimum qualifications, the Law School could achieve its vision of the racially aesthetic student body without the use of racial discrimination. The Law School concedes this, but the Court holds, implicitly and under the guise of narrow tailoring, that the Law School has a compelling state interest in doing what it wants to do. I cannot agree. First, under strict scrutiny, the Law School’s assessment of the benefits of racial discrimination and devotion to the admissions status quo are not entitled to any sort of deference, grounded in the First Amendment or anywhere else. Second, even if its “academic selectivity” must be maintained at all costs along with racial discrimination, the Court ignores the fact that other top law schools have succeeded in meeting their aesthetic demands without racial discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbf595ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s deference to the Law School’s conclusion that its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits will, if adhered to, have serious collateral consequences. The Court relies heavily on social science evidence to justify its deference. The Court never acknowledges, however, the growing evidence <span title="815" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-815">p. 815</span>that racial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students. See, e.g., Flowers &amp; Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College Racial Composition on African American Students After 3 Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669, 674 (1999) (concluding that black students experience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and that, even among blacks, “a substantial diversity moderates the cognitive effects of attending an HBC”); Allen, The Color of Success: African-American College Student Outcomes at Predominantly White and Historically Black Public Colleges and Universities, 62 Harv. Educ. Rev. 26, 35 (1992) (finding that black students attending HBCs report higher academic achievement than those attending predominantly white colleges).</p>
<p id="fbf595ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority grants deference to the Law School’s “assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits.” It follows, therefore, that an HBC’s assessment that racial homogeneity will yield educational benefits would similarly be given deference. An HBC’s rejection of white applicants in order to maintain racial homogeneity seems permissible, therefore, under the majority’s view of the Equal Protection Clause. Contained within today’s majority opinion is the seed of a new constitutional justification for a concept I thought long and rightly rejected—racial segregation.</p>

The rallying cry that in the absence of racial discrimination in admissions there would be a true meritocracy ignores the fact that the entire process is poisoned by numerous exceptions to “merit.” For example, in the national debate on racial discrimination in higher education admissions, much has been made of the fact that elite institutions utilize a so-called “legacy” preference to give the children of alumni an advantage in admissions. This, and other, exceptions to a “true” meritocracy give the lie to protestations that merit admissions are in fact the order of the day at the Nation’s universities. The Equal Protection Clause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissions procedures. What the Equal Protection Clause does prohibit are classifications made on the basis of race. So while legacy preferences can stand under the Constitution, racial discrimination cannot. I will not twist the Constitution to invalidate legacy preferences or otherwise impose my vision of higher education admissions on the Nation. The majority should similarly stay its impulse to validate faddish racial discrimination the Constitution clearly forbids.</p>

I believe what lies beneath the Court’s decision today are the benighted notions that one can tell when <span title="816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-816">p. 816</span>racial discrimination benefits (rather than hurts) minority groups, and that racial discrimination is necessary to remedy general societal ills. This Court’s precedents supposedly settled both issues, but clearly the majority still cannot commit to the principle that racial classifications are per se harmful and that almost no amount of benefit in the eye of the beholder can justify such classifications.</p>
<p id="fbf595b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I must contest the notion that the Law School’s discrimination benefits those admitted as a result of it. The Court spends considerable time discussing the impressive display of amicus support for the Law School in this case from all corners of society. But nowhere in any of the filings in this Court is any evidence that the purported “beneficiaries” of this racial discrimination prove themselves by performing at (or even near) the same level as those students who receive no preferences. Compare with Thernstrom &amp; Thernstrom, Reflections on the Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605-1608 (1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial discrimination in admissions to consider the fact that its “beneficiaries” are underperforming in the classroom).</p>
<p id="fbf595b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Law School tantalizes unprepared students with the promise of a University of Michigan degree and all of the opportunities that it offers. These overmatched students take the bait, only to find that they cannot succeed in the cauldron of competition. And this mismatch crisis is not restricted to elite institutions. See T. Sowell, Race and Culture 176-177 (1994) (“Even if most minority students are able to meet the normal standards at the ‘average’ range of colleges and universities, the systematic mismatching of minority students begun at the top can mean that such students are generally overmatched throughout all levels of higher education”). Indeed, to cover the tracks of the aestheticists, this cruel farce of racial discrimination must continue—in selection for the Michigan Law Review, and in hiring at law firms and for judicial clerkships—until the “beneficiaries” are no longer tolerated. While these students may graduate with law degrees, there is no evidence that they have received a qualitatively better legal education (or become better lawyers) than if they had gone to a less “elite” law school for which they were better prepared. And the aestheticists will never address the real problems facing “underrepresented minorities,” instead continuing their social experiments on other people’s children.</p>
<p id="fbf595b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond the harm the Law School’s racial discrimination visits upon its test subjects, no social science has disproved the notion that this discrimination “engender[s] attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government’s use of race.” “These programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are ‘entitled’ to preferences.” It is uncontested that each year, the Law School admits a handful of blacks who would be admitted in the absence of racial discrimination. Who can differentiate between those who belong and those who do not? The majority of blacks are admitted to the Law School because of discrimination, and because of this policy all are tarred as undeserving. This problem of stigma does not depend on determinacy as to whether those stigmatized are actually the “beneficiaries” of racial discrimination. When blacks take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or academia, it is an open question today whether their skin color played a part in their advancement.</p>

<p id="fbf5bcc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years before it is deemed no longer narrowly tailored to the Law School’s fabricated compelling state interest. While I agree that in 25 years the practices of the Law School will be illegal, they are, for the reasons I have given, illegal now. The majority does not and cannot rest its time limitation on any evidence that the gap in credentials between black and white students is shrinking or will be gone in that timeframe. In recent years there has been virtually no change, for example, in the proportion of law school applicants with LSAT scores of 165 and higher who are black. Nor is the Court’s holding that racial discrimination will be unconstitutional in 25 years made contingent on the gap closing in that time. I therefore can understand the imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School’s educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire.</p>
<p id="fbf5bcc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the immediate future, however, the majority has placed its imprimatur on a practice that can only weaken the principle of equality embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Equal Protection Clause. “Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). It has been nearly 140 years since Frederick Douglass asked the intellectual ancestors of the Law School to “[d]o nothing with us!” and the Nation adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. Now we must wait another 25 years to see this principle of equality vindicated. I therefore respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court’s opinion and the judgment.</p>

<p id="fbf5bcc8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that, “in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible,” the government must ensure that its means are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. I do not believe, however, that the University of Michigan Law School’s (Law School) means are narrowly tailored to the interest it asserts. The Law School claims it must take the steps it does to achieve a “‘critical mass’” of underrepresented minority students. But its actual program bears no relation to this asserted goal. Stripped of its “critical mass” veil, the Law School’s program is revealed as a naked effort to achieve racial balancing.</p>
<p id="fbf5bcc9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In practice, the Law School’s program bears little or no relation to its asserted goal of achieving “critical mass.” Respondents explain that the Law School seeks to accumulate a “critical mass” of each underrepresented minority group. But the record demonstrates that the Law School’s admissions practices with respect to these groups differ dramatically and cannot be defended under any consistent use of the term “critical mass.” From 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted between 1,130 and 1,310 students. Of those, between 13 and 19 were Native American, between 91 and 108 were African-Americans, and between 47 and 56 were Hispanic. If the Law School is admitting between 91 and 108 African-Americans in order to achieve “critical mass,” thereby preventing African-American students from feeling “isolated or like spokespersons for their race,” one would think that a number of the same order of magnitude would be necessary to accomplish the same purpose for Hispanics and Native <span title="818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-818">p. 818</span>Americans. Similarly, even if all of the Native American applicants admitted in a given year matriculate, which the record demonstrates is not at all the case, how can this possibly constitute a “critical mass” of Native Americans in a class of over 350 students? In order for this pattern of admission to be consistent with the Law School’s explanation of “critical mass,” one would have to believe that the objectives of “critical mass” offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African-Americans. But respondents offer no race-specific reasons for such disparities. Instead, they simply emphasize the importance of achieving “critical mass,” without any explanation of why that concept is applied differently among the three underrepresented minority groups.</p>
<p id="fbf5bcca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in an unprecedented display of deference under our strict scrutiny analysis, upholds the Law School’s program despite its obvious flaws. We have said that when it comes to the use of race, the connection between the ends and the means used to attain them must be precise. But here the flaw is deeper than that; it is not merely a question of “fit” between ends and means. Here the means actually used are forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbf5bccb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kennedy</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf5bccc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion by Justice Powell, in my view, states the correct rule for resolving this case. The Court, however, does not apply strict scrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines both the test and its own controlling precedents.</p>
<p id="fbf5bccd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, in a review that is nothing short of perfunctory, accepts the University of Michigan Law School’s assurances that its admissions process meets with constitutional requirements. The majority fails to confront the reality of how the Law School’s admissions policy is implemented. The dissenting opinion by The Chief Justice, which I join in full, demonstrates beyond question why the concept of critical mass is a delusion used by the Law School to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas. An effort to achieve racial balance among the minorities the school seeks to attract is, by the Court’s own admission, “patently unconstitutional.”</p>
<p id="fbf5bcce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be constitutional, a university’s compelling interest in a diverse student body must be achieved by a system where individual assessment is safeguarded through the entire process. There is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decisionmaking. The Law School failed to comply with this requirement, and by no means has it carried its burden to show otherwise by the test of strict scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbf5bccf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s refusal to apply meaningful strict scrutiny will lead to serious consequences. By deferring to the law schools’ choice of minority admissions programs, the courts will lose the talents and resources of the faculties and administrators in devising new and fairer ways to ensure individual consideration. Constant and rigorous judicial review forces the law school faculties to undertake their responsibilities as state employees in this most sensitive of areas with utmost fidelity to the mandate of the Constitution. Deference is antithetical to strict scrutiny, not consistent with it.</p>
<p id="fbf5bcd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="819" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-819">p. 819</span>It is regrettable the Court’s important holding allowing racial minorities to have their special circumstances considered in order to improve their educational opportunities is accompanied by a suspension of the strict scrutiny which was the predicate of allowing race to be considered in the first place. If the Court abdicates its constitutional duty to give strict scrutiny to the use of race in university admissions, it negates my authority to approve the use of race in pursuit of student diversity. The Constitution cannot confer the right to classify on the basis of race even in this special context absent searching judicial review. For these reasons, though I reiterate my approval of giving appropriate consideration to race in this one context, I must dissent in the present case.</p>

Both petitioners are Caucasian. Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in April that the LSA was unable to offer her admission. She enrolled in the University of Michigan at Dearborn, from which she graduated in the spring of 1999.

<p id="fbf5e3ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly. The University’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions <span title="820" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-820">p. 820</span>(OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process. In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year. Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.</p>
<p id="fbf5e3ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership. OUA also considers race. During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be “underrepresented minorities,” and it is undisputed that the University admits “virtually every qualified . . . applicant” from these groups.</p>
<p id="fbf5e3ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the “SCUGA” factors. These factors included the quality of an applicant’s high school (S), the strength of an applicant’s high school curriculum (C), an applicant’s unusual circumstances (U), an applicant’s geographical residence (G), and an applicant’s alumni relationships (A). After these scores were combined to produce an applicant’s “GPA 2” score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of “Guidelines” tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis. Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.</p>
<p id="fbf5e3f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status. For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratz’s GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application. An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratz’s scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.</p>
<p id="fbf5e3f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure. Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicant’s GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the “U” category in the SCUGA factors. Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing). Under the 1997 procedures, Hamacher’s GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision. An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.</p>
<p id="fbf5e3f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA [relied on] a “selection index,” on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points. This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100-150 (admit); 95-99 (admit or postpone); 90-94 (postpone or admit); 75-89 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject). Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicant’s high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership. Of particular significance here, under a “miscellaneous” category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based <span title="821" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-821">p. 821</span>upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.

<p id="fbf60b04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners argue that “diversity as a basis for employing racial preferences is simply too open-ended, ill-defined, and indefinite to constitute a compelling interest capable of supporting narrowly-tailored means.” But for the reasons set forth today in Grutter v. Bollinger, the Court has rejected these arguments of petitioners.</p>
<p id="fbf60b05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is by now well established that “all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.” This “‘standard of review . . . is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification.’” To withstand our strict scrutiny analysis, respondents must demonstrate that the University’s use of race in its current admission program employs “narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.” We find that the University’s policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single “underrepresented minority” applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity that respondents claim justifies their program.</p>
<p id="fbf60b06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration. The LSA’s policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an “underrepresented minority” group, as defined by the University. The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell’s example, where the race of a “particular black applicant” could be considered without being decisive, the LSA’s automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making “the factor of race . . . decisive” for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.</p>
<p id="fbf60b07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents contend that “[t]he volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for [LSA] to use the . . . admissions system” upheld by the Court today in <i>Grutter</i>. But the fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system. Nothing in Justice Powell’s opinion in <i>Bakke</i> signaled that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve the stated goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by our strict scrutiny analysis.</p>
<p id="fbf60b08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, therefore, that because the University’s use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents’ asserted compelling interest in diversity, the admissions policy violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We further find that the admissions policy also violates Title VI and 42 U.S.C. §1981.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1193E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1193E_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">97</a></span></p>

<p id="fbf60b0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the law school admissions policy the Court upholds today in Grutter v. Bollinger, the procedures employed by the University of Michigan’s (University) Office of Undergraduate Admissions do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants. The law school considers the various diversity qualifications of each applicant, including race, on a case-by-case basis. By contrast, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions relies on the selection index to assign every underrepresented minority applicant the same, automatic 20-point bonus without consideration of the particular background, experiences, or qualities of each individual applicant. And this mechanized selection index score, by and large, automatically determines the admissions decision for each applicant. The selection index thus precludes admissions counselors from conducting the type of individualized consideration the Court’s opinion in <i>Grutter</i> requires: consideration of each applicant’s individualized qualifications, including the contribution each individual’s race or ethnic identity will make to the diversity of the student body, taking into account diversity within and among all racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p id="fbf60b0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Office of Undergraduate Admissions does assign 20 points to some “soft” variables other than race, the points available for other diversity contributions, such as leadership and service, personal achievement, and geographic diversity, are capped at much lower levels. Even the most outstanding national high school leader could never receive more than five points for his or her accomplishments—a mere quarter of the points automatically assigned to an underrepresented minority solely based on the fact of his or her race. Of course, as Justice Powell made clear in <i>Bakke</i>, a university need not “necessarily accor[d]” all diversity factors “the same weight,” and the “weight attributed to a particular quality may vary from year to year depending on the ‘mix’ both of the student body and the applicants for the incoming class.” But the selection index, by setting up automatic, predetermined point allocations for the soft variables, ensures that the diversity contributions of applicants cannot be individually assessed. This policy stands in sharp contrast to the law school’s admissions plan, which enables admissions officers to make nuanced judgments with respect to the contributions each applicant is likely to make to the diversity of the incoming class. For these reasons, the record before us does not support the conclusion that the University of Michigan’s admissions program for its College of Literature, Science, and the Arts—to the extent that it considers race—provides the necessary individualized consideration.</p>

<p id="fbf6321f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Educational institutions, the Court acknowledges, are not barred from any and all consideration of race when making admissions decisions. But the Court once again maintains that the same standard of review controls judicial inspection of all official race classifications. This insistence on “consistency” would be fitting were our Nation free of the vestiges of rank discrimination long reinforced by law, but we are not far distant from an overtly discriminatory past, and the effects of centuries of law-sanctioned inequality remain painfully evident in our communities and schools.</p>
<p id="fbf63220-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the wake “of a system of racial caste only recently ended,” large disparities endure. Unemployment, poverty, and access to health care vary disproportionately by race. Neighborhoods and schools remain racially divided. African-American and Hispanic children are all too often educated in poverty-stricken and underperforming institutions. Adult African-Americans and Hispanics generally earn less than whites with equivalent levels of education. Equally credentialed job applicants receive different receptions depending on their race. Irrational prejudice is still encountered in real estate markets and consumer transactions. “Bias both conscious and unconscious, reflecting traditional and unexamined habits of thought, keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this country’s law and practice.”</p>
<p id="fbf63221-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution instructs all who act for the government that they may not “deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.” In implementing this equality instruction, as I see it, government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and inclusion. Actions designed to burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched discrimination and its after effects have been extirpated.</p>
<p id="fbf63222-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our jurisprudence ranks race a “suspect” category, “not because [race] is inevitably an impermissible classification, but because it is one which usually, to our national shame, has been drawn for the purpose of maintaining racial inequality.” But where race is considered “for the purpose of achieving equality,” no automatic proscription is in order. For, as insightfully explained, “[t]he Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination.” Contemporary human rights documents draw just this line; they distinguish between policies of oppression and measures designed to accelerate de facto equality.</p>
<p id="fbf63223-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mere assertion of a laudable governmental purpose, of course, should not immunize a race-conscious measure from careful judicial inspection. Close review is needed “to ferret out classifications in reality malign, but masquerading as benign,” and to “ensure that preferences are not so large as to trammel unduly upon the opportunities of others or interfere too harshly with legitimate expectations of persons in once-preferred groups.”</p>

<p id="fbf63225-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Examining in this light the admissions policy employed by the University of Michigan’s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (College), I see no constitutional infirmity. Like other top-ranking institutions, the College has many more applicants for admission than it can accommodate in an entering class. Every applicant admitted under the current plan, petitioners do not here dispute, is qualified to attend the College. The racial and ethnic groups to which the College accords special consideration (African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native-Americans) historically have been relegated to inferior status by law and social practice; their members continue to experience class-based discrimination to this day. There is no suggestion that the College adopted its current policy in order to limit or decrease enrollment by any particular racial or ethnic group, and no seats are reserved on the basis of race. Nor has there been any demonstration that the College’s program unduly constricts admissions opportunities for students who do not receive special consideration based on race.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11991_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11991_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">98</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf63227-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The stain of generations of racial oppression is still visible in our society, and the determination to hasten its removal remains vital. One can reasonably anticipate, therefore, that colleges and universities will seek to maintain their minority enrollment—and the networks and opportunities thereby opened to minority graduates—whether or not they can do so in full candor through adoption of affirmative action plans of the kind here at issue. Without recourse to such plans, institutions of higher education may resort to camouflage. For example, schools may encourage applicants to write of their cultural traditions in the essays they submit, or to indicate whether English is their second language. Seeking to improve their chances for admission, applicants may highlight the minority group associations to which they belong, or the Hispanic surnames of their mothers or grandparents. In turn, teachers’ recommendations may emphasize who a student is as much as what he or she has accomplished. If honesty is the best policy, surely Michigan’s accurately described, fully disclosed College affirmative action program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods, and disguises.</p>

<p id="fbf63228-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297 (2013), the Court did not reconsider <i>Grutter</i>, but held that a college or university must demonstrate that no race-neutral alternative could achieve diversity. The Court declared:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbf63229-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="825" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-825">p. 825</span>Once the University has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there must still be a further judicial determination that the admissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implementation. The University must prove that the means chosen by the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal. On this point, the University receives no deference. <i>Grutter</i> made clear that it is for the courts, not for university administrators, to ensure that “[t]he means chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.” True, a court can take account of a university’s experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions processes. But, as the Court said in <i>Grutter</i>, it remains at all times the University’s obligation to demonstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that admissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.”</p>
<p id="fbf6322a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court verify that it is “necessary” for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications. Although “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative,” strict scrutiny does require a court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university’s “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.” Consideration by the university is of course necessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny: The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity. If “‘a nonracial approach . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well and at tolerable administrative expense,’” then the university may not consider race. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the validity of a university’s adoption of an affirmative action plan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.</p>

<p id="fbf65944-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University of Texas at Austin (or University) relies upon a complex system of admissions that has undergone significant evolution over the past two decades. [In 1997], the Texas Legislature enacted H.B. 588, commonly known as the Top Ten Percent Law. As its name suggests, the Top Ten Percent Law guarantees <span title="826" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-826">p. 826</span>college admission to students who graduate from a Texas high school in the top 10 percent of their class. Those students may choose to attend any of the public universities in the State.</p>
<p id="fbf65945-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University implemented the Top Ten Percent Law in 1998. After <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i> (2003), the University adopted a new admissions policy to implement it. The University has continued to use that admissions policy to this day.</p>
<p id="fbf65946-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the University’s new admissions policy was a direct result of <i>Grutter,</i> it is not identical to the policy this Court approved in that case. Instead, consistent with the State’s legislative directive, the University continues to fill a significant majority of its class through the Top Ten Percent Plan (or Plan). Today, up to 75 percent of the places in the freshman class are filled through the Plan. As a practical matter, this 75 percent cap, which has now been fixed by statute, means that, while the Plan continues to be referenced as a “Top Ten Percent Plan,” a student actually needs to finish in the top seven or eight percent of his or her class in order to be admitted under this category.</p>
<p id="fbf65947-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University did adopt an approach similar to the one in <i>Grutter</i> for the remaining 25 percent or so of the incoming class. This portion of the class continues to be admitted based on a combination of their [Academic Achievement Index, which is based on the student’s grades and test scores] and [Personal Achievement Index] scores. [R]ace is given weight as a subfactor within the PAI. The PAI is a number from 1 to 6 (6 is the best) that is based on two primary components. The first component is the average score a reader gives the applicant on two required essays. The second component is a full-file review that results in another 1-to-6 score, the “Personal Achievement Score” or PAS.</p>
<p id="fbf65948-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, although admissions officers can consider race as a positive feature of a minority student’s application, there is no dispute that race is but a “factor of a factor of a factor” in the holistic-review calculus. Furthermore, consideration of race is contextual and does not operate as a mechanical plus factor for underrepresented minorities.</p>
<p id="fbf65949-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Abigail Fisher applied for admission to the University’s 2008 freshman class. She was not in the top 10 percent of her high school class, so she was evaluated for admission through holistic, full-file review. Petitioner’s application was rejected.</p>
<p id="fbf6594a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner then filed suit alleging that the University’s consideration of race as part of its holistic-review process disadvantaged her and other Caucasian applicants, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbf6594c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fisher I</i> set forth three controlling principles relevant to assessing the constitutionality of a public university’s affirmative-action program. First, “because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,” “[r]ace may not be considered [by a university] unless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny.” Strict scrutiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that its “‘purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.’”</p>
<p id="fbf6594d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="827" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-827">p. 827</span>Second, <i>Fisher I</i> confirmed that “the decision to pursue ‘the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity’ . . . is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper.” A university cannot impose a fixed quota or otherwise “define diversity as ‘some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.’” Once, however, a university gives “a reasoned, principled explanation” for its decision, deference must be given “to the University’s conclusion, based on its experience and expertise, that a diverse student body would serve its educational goals.”</p>
<p id="fbf6594e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, <i>Fisher I</i> clarified that no deference is owed when determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the university’s permissible goals. A university, <i>Fisher I</i> explained, bears the burden of proving a “nonracial approach” would not promote its interest in the educational benefits of diversity “about as well and at tolerable administrative expense.” Though “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative” or “require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence [and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups,” it does impose “on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating” that “race-neutral alternatives” that are both “available” and “workable” “do not suffice.”</p>

<p id="fbf65950-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he University [has a] continuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing circumstances. The University engages in periodic reassessment of the constitutionality, and efficacy, of its admissions program.

<p id="fbf68061-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the University examines this data, it should remain mindful that diversity takes many forms. Formalistic racial classifications may sometimes fail to capture diversity in all of its dimensions and, when used in a divisive manner, could undermine the educational benefits the University values. Through regular evaluation of data and consideration of student experience, the University must tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances, ensuring that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interest.</p>

<p id="fbf68063-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In seeking to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, petitioner makes four arguments. First, she argues that the University has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity. According to petitioner, the University must set forth more precisely the level of minority enrollment that would constitute a “critical mass.” Without a clearer sense of what the University’s ultimate goal is, petitioner argues, a reviewing court cannot assess whether the University’s admissions program is narrowly tailored to that goal.</p>
<p id="fbf68064-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="828" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-828">p. 828</span>As this Court’s cases have made clear, however, the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students. Rather, a university may institute a race-conscious admissions program as a means of obtaining “the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.” As this Court has said, enrolling a diverse student body “promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.” Equally important, “student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.”</p>
<p id="fbf68065-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to these educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner seems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to pure numbers. Indeed, since the University is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.</p>
<p id="fbf68066-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient. A university’s goals cannot be elusory or amorphous—they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.</p>
<p id="fbf68067-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University has provided in addition a “reasoned, principled explanation” for its decision to pursue these goals. The University’s 39-page proposal was written following a year-long study, which concluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful” in “provid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial understanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and learning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society.” Petitioner’s contention that the University’s goal was insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.</p>
<p id="fbf68068-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, petitioner argues that the University has no need to consider race because it had already “achieved critical mass” by 2003 using the Top Ten Percent Plan and race-neutral holistic review. Petitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a race-conscious plan. The record reveals, however, that, at the time of petitioner’s application, the University could not be faulted on this score. Before changing its policy the University conducted “months of study and deliberation, including retreats, interviews, [and] review of data,” and concluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful in achieving” sufficient racial diversity at the University. The record itself contains significant evidence, both statistical and anecdotal, in support of the University’s position.</p>
<p id="fbf68069-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, petitioner argues that considering race was not necessary because such consideration has had only a “‘minimal impact’ in advancing the [University’s] compelling interest.” Again, the record does not support this assertion. In 2003, 11 percent of the Texas residents enrolled through holistic review were Hispanic and 3.5 percent were African-American. In 2007, by contrast, 16.9 percent of the Texas holistic-review freshmen were Hispanic and 6.8 percent were African-American. Those increases—of 54 percent and 94 percent, respectively—show that consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on the diversity of the University’s freshman class.</p>
<p id="fbf6806a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="829" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-829">p. 829</span>In any event, it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for the impact of racial consideration to be minor. The fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.</p>
<p id="fbf6806b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner’s final argument is that “there are numerous other available race-neutral means of achieving” the University’s compelling interest. A review of the record reveals, however, that, at the time of petitioner’s application, none of her proposed alternatives was a workable means for the University to attain the benefits of diversity it sought. For example, petitioner suggests that the University could intensify its outreach efforts to African-American and Hispanic applicants. But the University submitted extensive evidence of the many ways in which it already had intensified its outreach efforts to those students.</p>
<p id="fbf6806c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to academic and socioeconomic factors in the University’s admissions calculus. This proposal ignores the fact that the University tried, and failed, to increase diversity through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors. And it further ignores this Court’s precedent making clear that the Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence.</p>
<p id="fbf6806d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner’s final suggestion is to uncap the Top Ten Percent Plan, and admit more—if not all—the University’s students through a percentage plan. As an initial matter, petitioner overlooks the fact that the Top Ten Percent Plan, though facially neutral, cannot be understood apart from its basic purpose, which is to boost minority enrollment. Percentage plans are “adopted with racially segregated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.” “It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that drives such plans.” Consequently, petitioner cannot assert simply that increasing the University’s reliance on a percentage plan would make its admissions policy more race neutral.</p>
<p id="fbf6806e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if, as a matter of raw numbers, minority enrollment would increase under such a regime, petitioner would be hard-pressed to find convincing support for the proposition that college admissions would be improved if they were a function of class rank alone. That approach would sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of enrolling a higher number of minority students. A system that selected every student through class rank alone would exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training. It would exclude a talented young biologist who struggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes. And it would exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school, only to find herself just outside of the top decile of her class.</p>
<p id="fbf6806f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these fundamental problems, an admissions policy that relies exclusively on class rank creates perverse incentives for applicants. Percentage plans “encourage parents to keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage students from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point averages.” For all these reasons, although it may be true that the Top Ten Percent Plan in some instances may provide a path out of poverty for those who excel at schools lacking in resources, the Plan cannot serve as the admissions solution that petitioner suggests. Wherever the balance between percentage plans and holistic review should rest, an effective admissions policy cannot prescribe, realistically, the exclusive use of a percentage plan.</p>
<p id="fbf6a780-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="830" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-830">p. 830</span>In short, none of petitioner’s suggested alternatives—nor other proposals considered or discussed in the course of this litigation—have been shown to be “available” and “workable” means through which the University could have met its educational goals, as it understood and defined them in 2008. The University has thus met its burden of showing that the admissions policy it used at the time it rejected petitioner’s application was narrowly tailored.</p>
<p id="fbf6a781-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A university is in large part defined by those intangible “qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness.” Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission. But still, it remains an enduring challenge to our Nation’s education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity. In striking this sensitive balance, public universities, like the States themselves, can serve as “laboratories for experimentation.”</p>
<p id="fbf6a782-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s affirmance of the University’s admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the University may rely on that same policy without refinement. It is the University’s ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.</p>

<p id="fbf6a784-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write separately to reaffirm that “a State’s use of race in higher education admissions decisions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.” “The Constitution abhors classifications based on race because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.” That constitutional imperative does not change in the face of a “faddish theor[y]” that racial discrimination may produce “educational benefits.” The Court was wrong to hold otherwise in <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i> (2003). I would overrule <i>Grutter</i> and reverse the Fifth Circuit’s judgment.</p>

In that decision, we held that strict scrutiny requires the University of Texas at Austin (UT or University) to show that its use of race and ethnicity in making admissions decisions serves compelling interests and that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve those ends. Rejecting the argument that we should defer to UT’s judgment on those matters, we made it clear that UT was obligated (1) to identify the interests justifying its plan with enough specificity to permit a reviewing court to determine whether the requirements of strict scrutiny were met, and (2) to show that those requirements were in fact satisfied. On remand, UT failed to do what our prior decision demanded. The University has still not identified with any degree of specificity the interests that its use of race and ethnicity is supposed to serve. Its primary argument is that merely invoking “the educational benefits of diversity” is sufficient and that it need not identify any metric that would allow a court to determine whether its plan is needed to serve, or is actually serving, those interests. This is nothing less than the plea for deference that we emphatically rejected in our prior decision. Today, however, the Court inexplicably grants that request.</p>
<p id="fbf6a787-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="831" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-831">p. 831</span>To the extent that UT has ever moved beyond a plea for deference and identified the relevant interests in more specific terms, its efforts have been shifting, unpersuasive, and, at times, less than candid. When it adopted its race-based plan, UT said that the plan was needed to promote classroom diversity. It pointed to a study showing that African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American students were underrepresented in many classes. But UT has never shown that its race-conscious plan actually ameliorates this situation. The University presents no evidence that its admissions officers, in administering the “holistic” component of its plan, make any effort to determine whether an African-American, Hispanic, or Asian-American student is likely to enroll in classes in which minority students are underrepresented. Nor has UT explained why the underrepresentation of Asian-American students in many classes justifies its plan, which discriminates <i>against</i> those students.</p>
<p id="fbf6a788-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At times, UT has claimed that its plan is needed to achieve a “critical mass” of African-American and Hispanic students, but it has never explained what this term means. According to UT, a critical mass is neither some absolute number of African-American or Hispanic students nor the percentage of African-Americans or Hispanics in the general population of the State. The term remains undefined, but UT tells us that it will let the courts know when the desired end has been achieved. This is a plea for deference—indeed, for blind deference—the very thing that the Court rejected in <i>Fisher I.</i></p>
<p id="fbf6a789-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UT has also claimed at times that the race-based component of its plan is needed because the Top Ten Percent Plan admits <i>the wrong kind</i> of African-American and Hispanic students, namely, students from poor families who attend schools in which the student body is predominantly African-American or Hispanic. As UT put it in its brief in <i>Fisher I,</i> the race-based component of its admissions plan is needed to admit “[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas.”</p>
<p id="fbf6a78a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should not have been necessary for us to grant review a second time in this case, and I have no greater desire than the majority to see the case drag on. But that need not happen. When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious plan, it had every reason to know that its plan would have to satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would be <i>its burden</i> to show that the plan was narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests. UT has failed to make that showing. By all rights, judgment should be entered in favor of petitioner.</p>
<p id="fbf6a78b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if the majority is determined to give UT yet another chance, we should reverse and send this case back to the District Court. What the majority has now done—awarding a victory to UT in an opinion that fails to address the important issues in the case—is simply wrong.</p>

<p id="fbf6ce9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UT’s race-conscious admissions program cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. UT says that the program furthers its interest in the educational benefits of diversity, but it has failed to define that interest with any clarity or to demonstrate that its program is narrowly tailored to achieve that or any other particular interest. By accepting UT’s rationales as sufficient to meet its burden, the majority licenses UT’s perverse assumptions about different groups of minority students—the precise assumptions strict scrutiny is supposed to stamp out.</p>
<p id="fbf6ce9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="832" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-832">p. 832</span>Here, UT has failed to define its interest in using racial preferences with clarity. As a result, the narrow tailoring inquiry is impossible, and UT cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. When UT adopted its challenged policy, it characterized its compelling interest as obtaining a “‘critical mass’” of underrepresented minorities. The 2004 Proposal claimed that “[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs has not been successful in achieving a critical mass of racial diversity.” But to this day, UT has not explained in anything other than the vaguest terms what it means by “critical mass.” In fact, UT argues that it need not identify <i>any</i> interest more specific than “securing the educational benefits of diversity.”</p>
<p id="fbf6ce9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UT has insisted that critical mass is not an absolute number. Instead, UT prefers a deliberately malleable “we’ll know it when we see it” notion of critical mass. It defines “critical mass” as “an adequate representation of minority students so that the . . . educational benefits that can be derived from diversity can actually happen,” and it declares that it “will . . . know [that] it has reached critical mass” when it “see[s] the educational benefits happening.” In other words: Trust us. This intentionally imprecise interest is designed to insulate UT’s program from meaningful judicial review.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By accepting these amorphous goals as sufficient for UT to carry its burden, the majority violates decades of precedent rejecting blind deference to government officials defending “‘inherently suspect’” classifications.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming UT is correct that, under <i>Grutter,</i> it need only cite a generic interest in the educational benefits of diversity, its plan still fails strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored. Narrow tailoring requires “a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.” Here, there is no evidence that race-blind, holistic review would not achieve UT’s goals at least “about as well” as UT’s race-based policy. In addition, UT could have adopted other approaches to further its goals, such as intensifying its outreach efforts, uncapping the Top Ten Percent Law, or placing greater weight on socioeconomic factors.</p>

<p id="fbf6cea3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to understand what is and what is not at stake in this case. <i>What is not at stake</i> is whether UT or any other university may adopt an admissions plan that results in a student body with a broad representation of students from all racial and ethnic groups. UT previously had a race-neutral plan that it claimed had “effectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action,” and UT could have taken other steps that would have increased the diversity of its admitted students without taking race or ethnic background into account.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is at stake is whether university administrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply by asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve “the educational benefits of diversity,” without explaining—much less proving—why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its objectives. Even though UT has never provided any coherent explanation for its asserted need to discriminate on the basis of race, and even though UT’s position relies on a series of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions, the majority concludes that UT has met its heavy burden. This conclusion is remarkable—and remarkably wrong.</p>

Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. 291 (2014), the Court considered the constitutionality of a voter-passed initiative that prohibits affirmative action. In 2006, Michigan voters passed an initiative, Proposal 2, that amended the state constitution to prohibit the state or its political subdivisions from discriminating or giving preference based on race or gender in education, contracting, or employment.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two lawsuits were brought challenging this in the area of education. The district court upheld Proposal 2, but the Sixth Circuit declared it unconstitutional in a panel decision and then in an 8-7 <i>en banc</i> ruling.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Sixth Circuit, relying on earlier Supreme Court decisions in Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, concluded that the initiative impermissibly restructured the political process along racial lines. Under Proposal 2, groups other than racial minorities can continue to go to the Michigan Board of Regents or the Michigan state legislature to obtain preferences in admissions. These bodies could award preferences to those who come from Michigan, or from a particular part of the state, or those whose parents attended the university, or those with particular interests.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, if racial minorities want a preference in admission, they need to go through the arduous process of amending the state constitution. In other words, the initiative singles out race and says that it is to be treated differently from all other types of preferences. In practical reality, this means that racial minorities face a significant barrier to using the political process that is not imposed on other groups.</p>
<p id="fbf6cea9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in a 6-2 decision without a majority opinion, reversed the Sixth Circuit and upheld the Michigan initiative. Justice Kennedy wrote a plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Justice Kennedy said that no state is required to have affirmative action and it may eliminate it, including by an initiative. Justice Kennedy distinguished Hunter v. Erickson and Washington v. Seattle Schools, saying that they had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account of race. Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment, joined by Justice Thomas and said that <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Washington</i> are not distinguishable and should be overruled. Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment and stressed the importance of deference to the political process and the initiative process.</p>
<p id="fbf6f5ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Sotomayor wrote a lengthy, vehement dissent, joined by Justice Ginsburg. Justice Sotomayor argued that affirmative action is essential to remedy the history of discrimination and contended that Michigan’s Proposal 2 impermissibly restructured the political process to the detriment of racial minorities.</p>

<p id="fbf6f5bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One other form of affirmative action has received substantial attention from the Supreme Court: the use of race by the government to draw election districts so as to increase the likelihood that minority groups will be able to choose a representative. This might be done by grouping African Americans or Latinos together in a single district where they are the majority. Between 1993 and 1996, the Supreme Court decided four cases on the constitutionality of using race in <span title="834" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-834">p. 834</span>districting to help racial minorities:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B37_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B37_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">99</a></span> Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995), Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996), and Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996). In these cases, the Court addressed three major issues.</p>
<p id="fbf6f5bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, in each case, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of race in drawing election districts must meet strict scrutiny. Shaw v. Reno held, and each subsequent case reaffirmed, that the use of race in drawing election districts is permissible only if the government can show that it is necessary to achieve a compelling purpose. Although this is consistent with recent Supreme Court cases mandating strict scrutiny for government affirmative action efforts, the dissent made a strong argument that affirmative action in voting is different than affirmative action in areas such as employment or education. In the latter areas, racial classifications benefiting minorities arguably disadvantage a white individual who is not hired or admitted because of the affirmative action program. But in voting, every person still gets to vote and every vote is counted equally.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B41_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B41_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">100</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf6f5c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, there is a long history of the government drawing district lines to keep racial and ethnic groups together. Justice Ginsburg, dissenting in Miller v. Johnson, observed, “To accommodate the reality of ethnic bonds, legislatures have long drawn voting districts along ethnic lines. Our Nation’s cities are full of districts identified by their ethnic character—Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, Russian, for example.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B4A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B4A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">101</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf6f5c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court indicated two ways in which it can be demonstrated that race was used in drawing election districts and thus strict scrutiny is to be applied. One is if a district has a “bizarre” shape that, in itself, makes clear that race was the basis for drawing the lines. Shaw v. Reno and Shaw v. Hunt involved an election district in North Carolina that had a quite unusual shape— it was very long and very narrow—and that had an African American majority. The Supreme Court said that it was apparent from the shape of the district that race had been used in drawing the district lines to create a majority black district.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B53_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B53_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">102</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf6f5c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, if the use of race in districting cannot be inferred from the shape of the district, strict scrutiny is justified if it is proven that race was a “predominant” factor in drawing the lines. In Miller v. Johnson, the Court considered an election district in Georgia that also had been created to provide a majority black district. Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, said that if it is not obvious from the shape of the district that race was used in drawing its lines, the judiciary should use strict scrutiny if it is demonstrated that race was a “predominant” factor in districting.</p>
<p id="fbf6f5c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bush v. Vera, which involved congressional districts in Texas, reaffirmed this. Justice O’Connor, writing for a plurality, stated, “Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. Nor does it apply to all cases of intentional creation of majority-minority districts. . . . For strict scrutiny to apply, the plaintiffs must prove that other, legitimate districting principles were ‘subordinated’ to race.” The plurality concluded that strict <span title="835" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-835">p. 835</span>scrutiny was appropriate in evaluating the Texas districts because the evidence demonstrated that racial motivations had a qualitatively greater influence on the drawing of district lines than political motivations.</p>
<p id="fbf6f5c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court considered what justifications are sufficient to meet strict scrutiny. For example, the Court held that §5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires that the Justice Department approve changes in election systems in states where there has been a history of race discrimination with regard to voting, does not justify the use of race in districting.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B66_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B66_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">103</a></span> The views of the Justice Department about the desirability of maximizing minority districts do not constitute a compelling interest sufficient to meet strict scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbf71bd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more difficult question is whether compliance with the 1982 Amendments to §2 of the Voting Rights Act is sufficient to meet strict scrutiny. Section two prohibits election systems, such as in districting, that have discriminatory effects against racial minorities. In Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera, the Court avoided the question of whether complying with this statutory provision is a compelling interest by finding that §2 would not have been violated by the failure to use race in districting in these cases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B72_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B72_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">104</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf71bdb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in <i>Bush</i>, Justice O’Connor wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment where she expressed the view that “compliance with the results test of §2 of the Voting Rights Act is a compelling state interest.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B80_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11B80_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">105</a></span> In Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 237 (2001), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of districts for congressional seats in North Carolina. A three-judge federal district court held that North Carolina’s legislature had impermissibly used race as the “predominant factor” in drawing the 12th Congressional District’s boundaries. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, reversed the district court and found that its fact-finding was “clearly erroneous.” Justice Breyer, writing for the majority, drew a distinction between the use of race for political reasons as opposed to for the purpose of affirmative action. The Court was clear that the government may use race as a factor in districting if the goal is political, such as protecting a safe seat for an incumbent or creating a district that has a majority of one political party.</p>
<p id="fbf71bdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But courts struggled with how to determine if districting was predominately based on race or political party affiliation. The Court returned to the issue in Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455 (2017). Like many of the earlier cases, this involved drawing of congressional districts in North Carolina. Justice Kagan, writing for the majority, began by reviewing the well-established principles that “the plaintiff must prove that ‘race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.’ That entails demonstrating that the legislature ‘subordinated’ other factors—compactness, respect for political subdivisions, partisan advantage, what have you—to ‘racial considerations.’ . . . Second, if racial considerations predominated over others, the design of the district must withstand strict scrutiny.” The Court reaffirmed that race can be used in districting to avoid violation of the Voting Rights Act so long as the state “had ‘a strong basis <span title="836" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-836">p. 836</span>in evidence’ for concluding that the statute required its action. Or said otherwise, the State must establish that it had ‘good reasons’ to think that it would transgress the Act if it did <i>not</i> draw race-based district lines.”</p>
<p id="fbf71bde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court then addressed the issue that lower courts had struggled with since <i>Easley</i>: how to decide if districting was based on race or politics. The Court resolved this by saying that it does not matter; strict scrutiny is to be used if race is a predominant factor in districting, even if benefiting a political party was the most important consideration. The Court, albeit in a footnote, stated: “[T]hat inquiry is satisfied when legislators have ‘place[d] a significant number of voters within or without’ a district predominantly because of their race, regardless of their ultimate objective in taking that step. So, for example, if legislators use race as their predominant districting criterion with the end goal of advancing their partisan interests—perhaps thinking that a proposed district is more ‘sellable’ as a race-based VRA compliance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish much the same thing—their action still triggers strict scrutiny. In other words, the sorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even if race is meant to function as a proxy for other (including political) characteristics.”</p>
<p id="fbf71bdf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This seemingly ends the inquiry as to whether districting is done for racial reasons or for partisan advantage. So long as race is a predominant factor, strict scrutiny must be met.</p>

Many of the factors that explain the use of strict scrutiny for racial classifications also apply to gender discrimination.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BD8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11BD8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">109</a></span> For example, there is a long history of discrimination against women in virtually every aspect of society. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing as a law professor, observed, “When the post-Civil War amendments were added to the Constitution, women were not accorded the vote. [Married] women in many states could not contract, hold property, litigate on their own behalf, or even control their own earnings. The fourteenth amendment left all that untouched.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BE3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11BE3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">110</a></span> As a result, gender classifications, like race and national origin classifications, are usually based on stereotypes rather than important government interests. Many purported biological differences that are invoked to justify legal distinctions are in reality just stereotypes, such as in the cases reviewed below where women were kept from being licensed as bartenders or from being automatically considered for jury service.</p>
<p id="fbf742fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic. Strict scrutiny is advocated because of the need for a strong presumption against laws that discriminate against people based on traits that were not chosen and cannot be changed. Gender, like race, is an immediately visible characteristic. Moreover, women, like racial minorities, tend to be significantly underrepresented in the political process.</p>
<p id="fbf742fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who argue for intermediate rather than strict scrutiny for gender classifications make several arguments. In part, the argument is historical: The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment meant to outlaw only race discrimination.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BF4_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11BF4_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">111</a></span> Also, it is argued that biological differences between men and women make it more likely that gender classifications will be justified and thus less than strict scrutiny is appropriate to increase the chances that desirable laws will be upheld.</p>
<p id="fbf74300-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, it is claimed that women are a political majority who are not isolated from men and thus cannot be considered a discrete and insular minority. Professor Ely remarked, “I may be wrong in supposing that because women now are in a position to protect themselves they will, that we are thus unlikely to see in the future the sort of official gender discrimination that has marked our past. But if women don’t protect themselves from sex discrimination in the future, . . . [i]t will be because for one reason or another—substantive disagreement or more likely the assignment of a low priority to the issue—they don’t choose to.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C06_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11C06_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">112</a></span></p>
<p id="fbf74302-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The debate over whether strict or intermediate scrutiny should be used for gender classifications is complicated by the affirmative action debate. Many of <span title="838" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-838">p. 838</span>those who previously favored strict scrutiny for gender classifications now are concerned that such review would make it much more difficult for the government to engage in affirmative action to benefit women.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C14_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11C14_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">113</a></span> Because intermediate scrutiny is generally successful in challenging invidious discrimination against women, there is concern that the primary effect of strict scrutiny might be to limit programs that help women. There, of course, are still many advocates of strict scrutiny for gender and many who continue to believe that intermediate scrutiny is the best approach.</p>


<div id="fbf74304-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbf76a15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>EARLY CASES APPROVING GENDER DISCRIMINATION</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbf76a16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court first addressed a gender discrimination issue in 1872 in Bradwell v. The State of Illinois, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130 (1872), which upheld an Illinois law that prohibited women from being licensed to practice law. A very short majority opinion ruled against Myra Bradwell without considering gender discrimination. Justice Miller, writing for the Court, rejected the argument that practicing law was a “privilege” of citizenship protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbf76a17-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, Justice Bradley, in a concurring opinion, directly addressed the claim of sex discrimination and opined that the state was justified in excluding women from the practice of law: “The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator. And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things, and cannot be based on exceptional cases.” He concluded that “in view of the peculiar characteristics, destiny, and mission of woman, it is within the province of the legislature to ordain what offices, positions, and callings shall be filled and discharged by men.”</p>
<p id="fbf76a18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1875), the Court held that it was constitutional for a state to allow only men to vote. This, of course, was reversed by the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.</p>
<p id="fbf76a19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In several cases during the first third of the twentieth century, the Supreme Court upheld laws that expressly discriminated based on gender. During this period of constitutional history, often referred to as the <i>Lochner</i> era, the Supreme Court aggressively protected freedom of contract and invalidated many regulatory laws for violating that right.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C3F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11C3F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">114</a></span> However, the Court was much more willing to uphold such laws if women were being regulated. For example, although Lochner v. New York declared unconstitutional a maximum hours law for bakers,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C45_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11C45_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">115</a></span> three years later, in Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), the Supreme Court upheld a maximum hours law for women employed in factories.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C4B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11C4B_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">116</a></span> The Court in <i>Muller</i> said, “That woman’s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. . . . Differentiated by these matters from the other sex, she is properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her <span title="839" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-839">p. 839</span>protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men and could not be sustained.”</p>
<p id="fbf76a1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following this rationale, in Radice v. New York, 264 U.S. 292 (1924), the Court upheld a state law that prohibited women from being employed in restaurants between 10:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> and 6:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">a.m.</span> However, the Court initially rejected a state law that created a minimum wage for women. In Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U.S. 525 (1923), the Court said that “while the physical differences must be recognized in appropriate cases . . . women of mature age . . . may [not] be subjected to restrictions upon their liberty of contract which could not lawfully be imposed in the case of men under similar circumstances.” The Court later overruled this holding and in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 398 (1937)—a key case signaling the end of the <i>Lochner</i> era—upheld a minimum wage law for women, declaring, “What can be closer to the public interest than the health of women and their protection from unscrupulous and overreaching employers? And if the protection of women is a legitimate end of the exercise of state power, how can it be said that the requirement of the payment of a minimum wage fairly fixed in order to meet the very necessities of existence is not an admissible means to that end?”</p>
<p id="fbf76a1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even after World War II and the entrance of many women into the labor market, the Supreme Court continued to allow gender discrimination based on stereotypes. In Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law that prevented the licensing of women as bartenders unless the woman was the wife or daughter of a male who owned the bar where she would work. Justice Frankfurter declared that “Michigan could, beyond question, forbid all women from working behind a bar.” He said that “the vast changes in the social and legal position of women . . . [do] not preclude the States from drawing a sharp line between the sexes, certainly in such matters as the regulation of the liquor traffic.” The Court said that the law’s discrimination among women was permissible because “the line they have drawn is not without a basis in reason”; “the oversight assured through ownership of a bar by a barmaid’s husband or father minimizes hazards that may confront a barmaid without such protecting oversight.”</p>
<p id="fbf76a1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1961, in Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961), the Court upheld a state law that made men eligible for jury service unless they requested and were granted an exception, whereas women were automatically exempted unless they waived it and expressed a desire to be included on the jury rolls. The Court applied the rational basis test and upheld the law. The Court said that “[d]espite the enlightened emancipation of women from the restrictions and protections of bygone years, and their entry into many parts of community life formerly considered to be reserved to men, woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life.” Thus, a state could exempt women “from the civic duty of jury service unless she herself determines that such service is consistent with her own special responsibilities.”</p>

<div id="fbf76a20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbf76a21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>THE EMERGENCE OF INTERMEDIATE SCRUTINY</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbf76a22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), the Supreme Court for the first time invalidated a gender classification, but the Court professed to apply only rational basis review. An Idaho law specified the hierarchy of persons to be appointed <span title="840" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-840">p. 840</span>as administrators of an estate when a person died intestate. Specifically, the law created eleven categories in rank order—parents were first, children second, and so on—and said that if there were two competing applicants in the same category, the male was to be preferred over the female.</p>
<p id="fbf76a23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court articulated the standard of review in traditional rational basis terms. It said, “A classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.” The Supreme Court said that the issue was whether gender had a rational relationship to the ability to administer the estate. Obviously, gender is irrelevant, and the Court held the law unconstitutional, concluding, “To give a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and whatever may be said as to the positive values of avoiding intrafamily controversy, the choice in this context may not lawfully be mandated solely on the basis of sex.”</p>
<p id="fbf76a24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Court purported to be using just the rational basis test and did not express the view that gender was a suspect classification, its reasoning was not characteristic of rational basis review. If the law had said, “When there are two people in a category who are equally qualified, one will be chosen by random selection,” that surely would have been permissible under rational basis review. Therefore, the use of gender had to have been regarded by the Court as worse than random selection and an inappropriate ground to use to simplify administration. In other words, the Court implicitly had to regard gender as an impermissible basis for government decisions.</p>
<p id="fbf79135-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Frontiero v. Richardson, four justices took the position that gender classifications should be subjected to strict scrutiny.</p>

<p id="fbf7913b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> announced the judgment of the Court in an opinion in which Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join.</p>
<p id="fbf7913c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before us concerns the right of a female member of the uniformed services to claim her spouse as a “dependent” for the purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits on an equal footing with male members. Under these statutes, a serviceman may claim his wife as a “dependent” without regard to whether she is in fact dependent upon him for any part of her support. A servicewoman, on the other hand, may not claim her husband as a “dependent” under these programs unless he is in fact dependent upon her for over one-half of his support. Thus, the question for decision is whether this difference in treatment constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbf7913d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Sharron Frontiero, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, sought increased quarters allowances, and housing and medical benefits for her husband, appellant Joseph Frontiero, on the ground that he was her “dependent.” Although such benefits would automatically have been granted with <span title="841" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-841">p. 841</span>respect to the wife of a male member of the uniformed services, appellant’s application was denied because she failed to demonstrate that her husband was dependent on her for more than one-half of his support.</p>
<p id="fbf7913e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, appellants contend that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin, are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. We agree and, indeed, find at least implicit support for such an approach in our unanimous decision only last Term in Reed v. Reed (1971).</p>
<p id="fbf7b84f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no doubt that our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination. Traditionally, such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of “romantic paternalism” which, in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage.</p>
<p id="fbf7b850-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of notions such as these, our statute books gradually became laden with gross, stereotyped distinctions between the sexes and, indeed, throughout much of the 19th century the position of women in our society was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under the pre–Civil War slave codes. Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married women traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians of their own children. And although blacks were guaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women were denied even that right—which is itself “preservative of other basic civil and political rights”—until adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later.</p>
<p id="fbf7b851-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, of course, that the position of women in America has improved markedly in recent decades. Nevertheless, it can hardly be doubted that, in part because of the high visibility of the sex characteristic, women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job market and, perhaps most conspicuously, in the political arena. Moreover, since sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate “the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility. . . . ” And what differentiates sex from such non-suspect statuses as intelligence or physical disability, and aligns it with the recognized suspect criteria, is that the sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society. As a result, statutory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members.</p>
<p id="fbf7b852-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these considerations in mind, we can only conclude that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, or national origin, are inherently suspect, and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny. Applying the analysis mandated by that stricter standard of review, it is clear that the statutory scheme now before us is constitutionally invalid.</p>
<p id="fbf7b853-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole basis of the classification established in the challenged statutes is the sex of the individuals involved. Thus, under [federal law] a female member of the uniformed services seeking to obtain housing and medical benefits for her spouse must prove his dependency in fact, whereas no such burden is imposed upon male members.</p>
<p id="fbf7b854-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the Government concedes that the differential treatment accorded men and women under these statutes serves no purpose other than mere <span title="842" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-842">p. 842</span>“administrative convenience.” In essence, the Government maintains that, as an empirical matter, wives in our society frequently are dependent upon their husbands, while husbands rarely are dependent upon their wives.</p>
<p id="fbf7b855-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government offers no concrete evidence, however, tending to support its view that such differential treatment in fact saves the Government any money. In order to satisfy the demands of strict judicial scrutiny, the Government must demonstrate, for example, that it is actually cheaper to grant increased benefits with respect to all male members, than it is to determine which male members are in fact entitled to such benefits and to grant increased benefits only to those members whose wives actually meet the dependency requirement.</p>
<p id="fbf7b856-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any case, our prior decisions make clear that, although efficacious administration of governmental programs is not without some importance, “the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency.” Stanley v. Illinois (1972). And when we enter the realm of “strict judicial scrutiny,” there can be no doubt that “administrative convenience” is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. We therefore conclude that, by according differential treatment to male and female members of the uniformed services for the sole purpose of achieving administrative convenience, the challenged statutes violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as they require a female member to prove the dependency of her husband.</p>
<p id="fbf7b857-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> concurs in the judgment, agreeing that the statutes before us work an invidious discrimination in violation of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbf7b858-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Powell</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span> join, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fbf7b859-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree that the challenged statutes constitute an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but I cannot join the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan, which would hold that all classifications based upon sex, “like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin,” are “inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny.” It is unnecessary for the Court in this case to characterize sex as a suspect classification, with all of the far-reaching implications of such a holding. In my view, we can and should decide this case on the authority of <i>Reed</i> and reserve for the future any expansion of its rationale.</p>

<p id="fbf7b85a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975), the Court declared unconstitutional a Utah law that required that parents support their female children until age 18 but that male children be supported until age 21. The Court said that the statute was based on “old notions” about social roles; “[no] longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas. Women’s activities and responsibilities are increasing and expanding.” Again, the Court decided without a holding as to the level of scrutiny. In fact, the Court said that the law was unconstitutional “under any test—compelling state interest, or rational basis, or something in between.”</p>

<p id="fbf7df71-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbf7df72-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The interaction of two sections of an Oklahoma statute, prohibits the sale of “nonintoxicating” 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18. The question to be decided is whether such a gender-based differential constitutes a denial to males 18-20 years of age of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbf7df73-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that <i>Reed</i> emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are “subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.</p>
<p id="fbf7df74-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We accept for purposes of discussion the District Court’s identification of the objective underlying §§241 and 245 as the enhancement of traffic safety. Clearly, the protection of public health and safety represents an important function of state and local governments. However, appellees’ statistics in our view cannot support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under <i>Reed</i> withstand equal protection challenge.</p>
<p id="fbf7df75-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellees introduced a variety of statistical surveys. First, an analysis of arrest statistics for 1973 demonstrated that 18- to 20-year-old male arrests for “driving under the influence” and “drunkenness” substantially exceeded female arrests for that same age period. Similarly, youths aged 17-21 were found to be overrepresented among those killed or injured in traffic accidents, with males again numerically exceeding females in this regard. Third, a random roadside survey in Oklahoma City revealed that young males were more inclined to drive and drink beer than were their female counterparts. Fourth, Federal Bureau of Investigation nationwide statistics exhibited a notable increase in arrests for “driving under the influence.” Finally, statistical evidence gathered in other jurisdictions, particularly Minnesota and Michigan, was offered to corroborate Oklahoma’s experience by indicating the pervasiveness of youthful participation in motor vehicle accidents following the imbibing of alcohol.</p>
<p id="fbf7df76-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even were this statistical evidence accepted as accurate, it nevertheless offers only a weak answer to the equal protection question presented here. The most focused and relevant of the statistical surveys, arrests of 18- to 20-year-olds for alcohol-related driving offenses, exemplifies the ultimate unpersuasiveness of this evidentiary record. Viewed in terms of the correlation between sex and the actual activity that Oklahoma seeks to regulate—driving while under the influence of alcohol—the statistics broadly establish that .18% of females and 2% of males in that age group were arrested for that offense. While such a disparity is not trivial in a statistical sense, it hardly can form the basis for employment of a gender line as a classifying device. Certainly if maleness is to serve as a proxy <span title="844" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-844">p. 844</span>for drinking and driving, a correlation of 2% must be considered an unduly tenuous “fit.” Indeed, prior cases have consistently rejected the use of sex as a decisionmaking factor even though the statutes in question certainly rested on far more predictive empirical relationships than this.</p>
<p id="fbf7df77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the statistics exhibit a variety of other shortcomings that seriously impugn their value to equal protection analysis. Setting aside the obvious methodological problems, the surveys do not adequately justify the salient features of Oklahoma’s gender-based traffic-safety law. None purports to measure the use and dangerousness of 3.2% beer as opposed to alcohol generally, a detail that is of particular importance since, in light of its low alcohol level, Oklahoma apparently considers the 3.2% beverage to be “nonintoxicating.” Moreover, many of the studies, while graphically documenting the unfortunate increase in driving while under the influence of alcohol, make no effort to relate their findings to age-sex differentials as involved here. Indeed, the only survey that explicitly centered its attention upon young drivers and their use of beer, albeit apparently not of the diluted 3.2% variety, reached results that hardly can be viewed as impressive in justifying either a gender or age classification.</p>
<p id="fbf7df78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the gender-based differential contained in [Oklahoma law] constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws to males aged 18-20.</p>
<p id="fbf7df79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf7df7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s disposition of this case is objectionable on two grounds. First is its conclusion that men challenging a gender-based statute which treats them less favorably than women may invoke a more stringent standard of judicial review than pertains to most other types of classifications. Second is the Court’s enunciation of this standard, without citation to any source, as being that “classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.”</p>
<p id="fbf7df7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only redeeming feature of the Court’s opinion, to my mind, is that it apparently signals a retreat by those who joined the plurality opinion in Frontiero v. Richardson (1973), from their view that sex is a “suspect” classification for purposes of equal protection analysis. I think the Oklahoma statute challenged here need pass only the “rational basis” equal protection analysis and I believe that it is constitutional under that analysis.</p>
<p id="fbf7df7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s conclusion that a law which treats males less favorably than females “must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives” apparently comes out of thin air. The Equal Protection Clause contains no such language, and none of our previous cases adopt that standard. I would think we have had enough difficulty with the two standards of review which our cases have recognized—the norm of “rational basis,” and the “compelling state interest” required where a “suspect classification” is involved—so as to counsel weightily against the insertion of still another “standard” between those two. How is this Court to divine what objectives are important? How is it to determine whether a particular law is “substantially” related to the achievement of such objective, rather than related in some other way to its achievement? Both of the phrases used are so diaphanous and elastic as to invite subjective judicial preferences or prejudices relating to particular types of legislation, masquerading as judgments whether such legislation is directed at “important” objectives or, whether the relationship to those objectives is “substantial” enough.</p>
<p id="fbf8068d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="845" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-845">p. 845</span>One survey of arrest statistics assembled in 1973 indicated that males in the 18-20 age group were arrested for “driving under the influence” almost 18 times as often as their female counterparts, and for “drunkenness” in a ratio of almost 10 to 1. Accepting, as the Court does, appellants’ comparison of the total figures with 1973 Oklahoma census data, this survey indicates a 2% arrest rate among males in the age group, as compared to a .18% rate among females.</p>
<p id="fbf8068e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other surveys indicated (1) that over the five-year period from 1967 to 1972, nationwide arrests among those under 18 for drunken driving increased 138%, and that 93% of all persons arrested for drunken driving were male; (2) that youths in the 17-21 age group were overrepresented among those killed or injured in Oklahoma traffic accidents, that male casualties substantially exceeded female, and that deaths in this age group continued to rise while overall traffic deaths declined; (3) that over three-fourths of the drivers under 20 in the Oklahoma City area are males, and that each of them, on average, drives half again as many miles per year as their female counterparts; (4) that four-fifths of male drivers under 20 in the Oklahoma City area state a drink preference for beer, while about three-fifths of female drivers of that age state the same preference; and (5) that the percentage of male drivers under 20 admitting to drinking within two hours of driving was half again larger than the percentage for females, and that the percentage of male drivers of that age group with a blood alcohol content greater than .01% was almost half again larger than for female drivers.</p>
<p id="fbf8068f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s criticism of the statistics relied on by the District Court conveys the impression that a legislature in enacting a new law is to be subjected to the judicial equivalent of a doctoral examination in statistics. Legislatures are not held to any rules of evidence such as those which may govern courts or other administrative bodies, and are entitled to draw factual conclusions on the basis of the determination of probable cause which an arrest by a police officer normally represents.</p>
<p id="fbf80690-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Oklahoma Legislature could have believed that 18- to 20-year-old males drive substantially more, and tend more often to be intoxicated than their female counterparts; that they prefer beer and admit to drinking and driving at a higher rate than females; and that they suffer traffic injuries out of proportion to the part they make up of the population. Under the appropriate rational-basis test for equal protection, it is neither irrational nor arbitrary to bar them from making purchases of 3.2% beer, which purchases might in many cases be made by a young man who immediately returns to his vehicle with the beverage in his possession. There being no violation of either equal protection or due process, the statute should accordingly be upheld.</p>

Moreover, as described below in subsection 3, the Court has held that intermediate scrutiny is to be used both for gender classifications discriminating against women and those discriminating against men.</p>

<p id="fbf8069a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia’s public institutions of higher learning include an incomparable military college, Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The United States maintains that the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee precludes Virginia from reserving exclusively to men the unique educational opportunities VMI affords. We agree.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbf8069b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">I</p></div>
<p id="fbf8069c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Founded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex school among Virginia’s 15 public institutions of higher learning. VMI’s distinctive mission is to produce “citizen-soldiers,” men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in military service. VMI pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia. Assigning prime place to character development, VMI uses an “adversative method” modeled on English public schools and once characteristic of military instruction. VMI constantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. The school’s graduates leave VMI with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress, and a large sense of accomplishment for completing the hazardous course.</p>
<p id="fbf82dad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, Members of Congress, and business executives. The school’s alumni overwhelmingly perceive that their VMI training helped them to realize their personal goals. VMI’s endowment reflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largest per-student endowment of all public undergraduate institutions in the Nation.</p>
<p id="fbf82dae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor VMI’s implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. And the school’s impressive record in producing leaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nevertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively for men the advantages and opportunities a VMI education affords.</p>

<p id="fbf82db0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to the Fourth Circuit’s ruling [that Virginia had violated equal protection], Virginia proposed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women’s Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsored undergraduate program would be located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal arts school for women, and would be open, initially, to about 25 to 30 students. Although VWIL would share VMI’s mission—to produce “citizen-soldiers”—the VWIL program would differ, as does Mary Baldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methods of education, and financial resources.</p>
<p id="fbf82db1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary Baldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMI freshmen. Mary Baldwin’s faculty holds “significantly fewer Ph.D.’s than the faculty at VMI,” and receives significantly lower salaries. While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, the sciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial, offered only bachelor of arts degrees. A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one, without public support, by attending Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two years, paying the required private tuition.</p>

First, does Virginia’s exclusion of women from the educational opportunities provided by VMI—extraordinary opportunities for military training and civilian leadership development—deny to women “capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,” the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment? Second, if VMI’s “unique” situation, as Virginia’s sole single-sex public institution of higher education—offends the Constitution’s equal protection principle, what is the remedial requirement?</p>

<p id="fbf82db5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note, once again, the core instruction of this Court’s pathmarking decisions: Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for that action. Today’s skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history. As a plurality of this Court acknowledged a generation ago, “our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.” Frontiero v. Richardson (1973). Through a century plus three decades and more of that history, women did not count among voters composing “We the People”; not until 1920 did women gain a constitutional right to the franchise. And for a half century thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women opportunities accorded men so long as any “basis in reason” could be conceived for the discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbf82db6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed “inherent differences” are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national origin classifications. Physical <span title="848" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-848">p. 848</span>differences between men and women, however, are enduring. “Inherent differences” between men and women, we have come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to compensate women “for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,” Califano v. Webster (1977), to “promot[e] equal employment opportunity,” to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people. But such classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.</p>
<p id="fbf82db7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shown no “exceedingly persuasive justification” for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia—the Mary Baldwin VWIL program—does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit’s final judgment in this case.</p>

<p id="fbf82db9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia challenges and asserts two justifications in defense of VMI’s exclusion of women. First, the Commonwealth contends, “single-sex education provides important educational benefits,” and the option of single-sex education contributes to “diversity in educational approaches.” Second, the Commonwealth argues, “the unique VMI method of character development and leadership training,” the school’s adversative approach, would have to be modified were VMI to admit women. We consider these two justifications in turn.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbf854cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is uncontested in this litigation. Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions can serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown that VMI was established, or has been maintained, with a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the Commonwealth. In cases of this genre, our precedent instructs that “benign” justifications proffered in defense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded.</p>

<p id="fbf854cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virginia next argues that VMI’s adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cannot be made available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be “radical,” so “drastic,” Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed “destroy,” VMI’s program. Neither sex would be favored by the transformation, Virginia maintains: Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currently available to them; women would not gain that opportunity because their participation would “eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from . . . other institutions of higher education in Virginia.”</p>
<p id="fbf854ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="849" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-849">p. 849</span>It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most women would not choose VMI’s adversative method. As Fourth Circuit Judge Motz observed, however, it is also probable that “many men would not want to be educated in such an environment.” Education, to be sure, is not a “one size fits all” business. The issue, however, is not whether “women—or men—should be forced to attend VMI”; rather, the question is whether the Commonwealth can constitutionally deny to women who have the will and capacity, the training and attendant opportunities that VMI uniquely affords.</p>
<p id="fbf854cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The notion that admission of women would downgrade VMI’s stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved, a prediction hardly different from other “self-fulfilling prophec[ies],” once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities.</p>
<p id="fbf854d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commonwealth’s misunderstanding and, in turn, the District Court’s, is apparent from VMI’s mission: to produce “citizen-soldiers,” individuals “‘imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend their country in time of national peril.’”</p>
<p id="fbf854d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women, who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men. Just as surely, the Commonwealth’s great goal is not substantially advanced by women’s categorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual merit, from the Commonwealth’s premier “citizen-soldier” corps. Virginia, in sum, “has fallen far short of establishing the ‘exceedingly persuasive justification,’” that must be the solid base for any gender-defined classification.</p>

<p id="fbf854d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presented its remedial plan—maintain VMI as a male-only college and create VWIL as a separate program for women. The plan met District Court approval.</p>
<p id="fbf854d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in “the position they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination].” The constitutional violation in this suit is the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional exclusion, we have explained, aims to “eliminate [so far as possible] the discriminatory effects of the past” and to “bar like discrimination in the future.” Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched, VMI’s exclusionary policy.</p>
<p id="fbf854d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Task Force charged with developing the leadership program for women, drawn from the staff and faculty at Mary Baldwin College, “determined that a military model and, especially VMI’s adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training most women.” As earlier stated, generalizations about “the way women are,” estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description. Notably, Virginia never asserted that VMI’s method of education suits most men. It is also revealing that <span title="850" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-850">p. 850</span>Virginia accounted for its failure to make the VWIL experience “the entirely militaristic experience of VMI” on the ground that VWIL “is planned for women who do not necessarily expect to pursue military careers.” By that reasoning, VMI’s “entirely militaristic” program would be inappropriate for men in general or as a group, for “[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service.”</p>
<p id="fbf854d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia rests, we note again these dispositive realities: VMI’s “implementing methodology” is not “inherently unsuitable to women,” “some women . . . do well under [the] adversative model,” “some women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,” “some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,” and “can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men.” It is on behalf of these women that the United States has instituted this suit, and it is for them that a remedy must be crafted, a remedy that will end their exclusion from a state-supplied educational opportunity for which they are fit, a decree that will “bar like discrimination in the future.”</p>
<p id="fbf87be7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf87be8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court shuts down an institution that has served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and distinction for over a century and a half. To achieve that desired result, it rejects (contrary to our established practice) the factual findings of two courts below, sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores the history of our people. As to facts: It explicitly rejects the finding that there exist “gender-based developmental differences” supporting Virginia’s restriction of the “adversative” method to only a men’s institution, and the finding that the all-male composition of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is essential to that institution’s character. As to precedent: It drastically revises our established standards for reviewing sex-based classifications. And as to history: It counts for nothing the long tradition, enduring down to the present, of men’s military colleges supported by both States and the Federal Government.</p>
<p id="fbf87be9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the Court’s opinion is devoted to deprecating the closed-mindedness of our forebears with regard to women’s education, and even with regard to the treatment of women in areas that have nothing to do with education. Closed-minded they were—as every age is, including our own, with regard to matters it cannot guess, because it simply does not consider them debatable. The virtue of a democratic system with a First Amendment is that it readily enables the people, over time, to be persuaded that what they took for granted is not so, and to change their laws accordingly. That system is destroyed if the smug assurances of each age are removed from the democratic process and written into the Constitution. So to counterbalance the Court’s criticism of our ancestors, let me say a word in their praise: They left us free to change. The same cannot be said of this most illiberal Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after another of the current preferences of the society (and in some cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society’s law-trained elite) into our Basic Law. Today it enshrines the notion that no substantial educational value is to be served by an all-men’s military academy—so that the decision by the people of Virginia to maintain such an institution denies equal protection to women who cannot attend that institution but can attend others. Since it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States—the old one—takes no sides in this educational debate, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbf87bec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two major ways of proving a gender classification; they are identical to the two methods of demonstrating a racial classification discussed above. First, the gender classification can exist on the face of the law; that is, the law in its very terms draws a distinction among people based on gender. All of the cases discussed thus far concerning gender discrimination are of this type. For example, Craig v. Boren involved a facial gender classification in that the Oklahoma law provided that women could buy low-alcohol beer at age 18, but men could not until age 21. Likewise, in United States v. Virginia, the Virginia policy that excluded women from attending the Virginia Military Institute was a classification on the face of the law.</p>
<p id="fbf87bed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, if a law is facially gender neutral, proving a gender classification requires demonstrating that there is both a discriminatory impact to the law and a discriminatory purpose behind it. In Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), presented in section C, the Supreme Court upheld a state law that gave a preference in hiring to veterans even though it had a substantial discriminatory impact against women. Helen Feeney repeatedly took civil service exams for particular positions and received among the highest scores in the state, but was placed behind lists of veterans with lower scores. At the time the litigation was commenced, “over 98% of the veterans in Massachusetts were male; only 1.8% were female. And over one-quarter of the Massachusetts population were veterans.”</p>
<p id="fbf87bee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court rejected the claim of gender discrimination. The Court said that the law providing a preference for veterans was gender-neutral and that discriminatory impact is not sufficient to prove the existence of sex-based classification; there also must be proof of a discriminatory purpose. The Court concluded that “nothing in the record demonstrates that this preference for veterans was originally devised or subsequently re-enacted because it would accomplish the collateral goal of keeping women in a stereotypic and predefined place in the Massachusetts civil service.” The ways of proving a discriminatory purpose based on gender are identical to the ways of proving a discriminatory racial purpose, described above.</p>

<p id="fbf8a307-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbf8a308-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For almost 30 years California has administered a disability insurance system that pays benefits to persons in private employment who are temporarily unable to work because of disability not covered by workmen’s compensation. The appellees brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of a provision of the California program that, in defining “disability,” excludes from coverage certain disabilities resulting from pregnancy.</p>
<p id="fbf8a309-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="852" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-852">p. 852</span>[Under California law] an individual is eligible for disability benefits if, during a one-year base period prior to his disability, he has contributed one percent of a minimum income of $300 to the Disability Fund. In the event he suffers a compensable disability, the individual can receive a “weekly benefit amount” of between $25 and $105, depending on the amount he earned during the highest quarter of the base period. In return for his one-percent contribution to the Disability Fund, the individual employee is insured against the risk of disability stemming from a substantial number of “mental or physical illness[es] and mental or physical injur[ies].”</p>
<p id="fbf8a30a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not every disabling condition, however, that triggers the obligation to pay benefits under the program. As already noted, for example, any disability of less than eight days’ duration is not compensable, except when the employee is hospitalized. Conversely, no benefits are payable for any single disability beyond 26 weeks. Further, disability is not compensable if it results from the individual’s court commitment as a dipsomaniac, drug addict, or sexual psychopath. Finally, the Unemployment Insurance Code excludes from coverage certain disabilities that are attributable to pregnancy. It is this provision that is at issue in the present case.</p>
<p id="fbf8a30b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that California intended to establish this benefit system as an insurance program that was to function essentially in accordance with insurance concepts. Since the program was instituted in 1946, it has been totally self-supporting, never drawing on general state revenues to finance disability or hospital benefits. The Disability Fund is wholly supported by the one percent of wages annually contributed by participating employees.</p>
<p id="fbf8a30c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ordering the State to pay benefits for disability accompanying normal pregnancy and delivery, the District Court acknowledged the State’s contention “that coverage of these disabilities is so extraordinarily expensive that it would be impossible to maintain a program supported by employee contributions if these disabilities are included.” There is considerable disagreement between the parties with respect to how great the increased costs would actually be, but they would clearly be substantial.</p>
<p id="fbf8a30d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot agree that the exclusion of this disability from coverage amounts to invidious discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. California does not discriminate with respect to the persons or groups which are eligible for disability insurance protection under the program. The classification challenged in this case relates to the asserted underinclusiveness of the set of risks that the State has selected to insure. Although California has created a program to insure most risks of employment disability, it has not chosen to insure all such risks, and this decision is reflected in the level of annual contributions exacted from participating employees. This Court has held that, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, a State “may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. . . . The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. . . .” Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. (1955). Particularly with respect to social welfare programs, so long as the line drawn by the State is rationally supportable, the courts will not interpose their judgment as to the appropriate stopping point.</p>
<p id="fbf8a30e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident that a totally comprehensive program would be substantially more costly than the present program and would inevitably require state subsidy, a higher rate of employee contribution, a lower scale of benefits for those <span title="853" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-853">p. 853</span>suffering insured disabilities, or some combination of these measures. There is nothing in the Constitution, however, that requires the State to subordinate or compromise its legitimate interests solely to create a more comprehensive social insurance program than it already has. The State has a legitimate interest in maintaining the self-supporting nature of its insurance program.</p>
<p id="fbf8a30f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These policies provide an objective and wholly noninvidious basis for the State’s decision not to create a more comprehensive insurance program than it has. There is no evidence in the record that the selection of the risks insured by the program worked to discriminate against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived by that group or class from the program. There is no risk from which men are protected and women are not. Likewise, there is no risk from which women are protected and men are not.</p>
<p id="fbf8a310-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups—pregnant women and non-pregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.</p>
<p id="fbf8a311-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons we have stated, we hold that this contention is not a valid one under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbf8a312-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf8a313-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disabilities caused by pregnancy, however, like other physically disabling conditions covered by the Code, require medical care, often include hospitalization, anesthesia and surgical procedures, and may involve genuine risk to life. Moreover, the economic effects caused by pregnancy-related disabilities are functionally indistinguishable from the effects caused by any other disability: wages are lost due to a physical inability to work, and medical expenses are incurred for the delivery of the child and for postpartum care. In my view, by singling out for less favorable treatment a gender-linked disability peculiar to women, the State has created a double standard for disability compensation: a limitation is imposed upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered, including those that affect only or primarily their sex, such as prostatectomies, circumcision, hemophilia, and gout. In effect, one set of rules is applied to females and another to males. Such dissimilar treatment of men and women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.</p>

<p id="fbf8a314-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress effectively overruled <i>Geduldig</i> by statute when it enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which defined sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination and which prohibits discrimination on that basis.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11EE6_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11EE6_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">118</a></span> Although <i>Geduldig</i>’s impact has been negated in the area of pregnancy by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, its reasoning is still applied by the Court in other <span title="854" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-854">p. 854</span>contexts. In Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263 (1993), the Supreme Court considered whether those blocking access to abortion clinics were engaged in a form of gender discrimination in violation of federal civil rights statutes. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, expressly invoked <i>Geduldig</i> in rejecting the claim that there was a gender-based animus behind the protests. Scalia said that there were two categories of individuals: persons protesting and persons receiving abortions. The Court said that there was not gender discrimination because women were both in the former category, protestors, and in the latter category, those seeking abortions.</p>

<p id="fbf8ca28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interestingly, the majority of Supreme Court cases concerning gender discrimination have involved laws that benefit women and disadvantage men.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11F01_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11F01_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">119</a></span> Two principles emerge from these decisions.

<p id="fbf8f143-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is the constitutionality of Alabama alimony statutes which provide that husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce.</p>
<p id="fbf8f144-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In authorizing the imposition of alimony obligations on husbands, but not on wives, the Alabama statutory scheme “provides that different treatment be accorded . . . on the basis of . . . sex; it thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” The fact that the classification expressly discriminates against men rather than women does not protect it from scrutiny. “To withstand scrutiny” under the Equal Protection Clause, “‘classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.’”</p>
<p id="fbf8f145-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="855" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-855">p. 855</span>Appellant views the Alabama alimony statutes as effectively announcing the State’s preference for an allocation of family responsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role, and as seeking for their objective the reinforcement of that model among the State’s citizens. We agree, as he urges, that prior cases settle that this purpose cannot sustain the statutes.</p>
<p id="fbf8f146-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion of the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals suggests other purposes that the statute may serve. Its opinion states that the Alabama statutes were “designed” for “the wife of a broken marriage who needs financial assistance.” This may be read as asserting either of two legislative objectives. One is a legislative purpose to provide help for needy spouses, using sex as a proxy for need. The other is a goal of compensating women for past discrimination during marriage, which assertedly has left them unprepared to fend for themselves in the working world following divorce. We concede, of course, that assisting needy spouses is a legitimate and important governmental objective. We have also recognized “[r]eduction of the disparity in economic condition between men and women caused by the long history of discrimination against women . . . as . . . an important governmental objective.” It only remains, therefore, to determine whether the classification at issue here is “substantially related to achievement of those objectives.”</p>
<p id="fbf8f147-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in this case, even if sex were a reliable proxy for need, and even if the institution of marriage did discriminate against women, these factors still would “not adequately justify the salient features of” Alabama’s statutory scheme. Under the statute, individualized hearings at which the parties’ relative financial circumstances are considered already occur. There is no reason, therefore, to use sex as a proxy for need. Needy males could be helped along with needy females with little if any additional burden on the State. In such circumstances, not even an administrative-convenience rationale exists to justify operating by generalization or proxy. Similarly, since individualized hearings can determine which women were in fact discriminated against vis-à-vis their husbands, as well as which family units defied the stereotype and left the husband dependent on the wife, Alabama’s alleged compensatory purpose may be effectuated without placing burdens solely on husbands. Progress toward fulfilling such a purpose would not be hampered, and it would cost the State nothing more, if it were to treat men and women equally by making alimony burdens independent of sex. “Thus, the gender-based distinction is gratuitous; without it, the statutory scheme would only provide benefits to those men who are in fact similarly situated to the women the statute aids,” and the effort to help those women would not in any way be compromised.</p>
<p id="fbf8f148-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, use of a gender classification actually produces perverse results in this case. As compared to a gender-neutral law placing alimony obligations on the spouse able to pay, the present Alabama statutes give an advantage only to the financially secure wife whose husband is in need. Although such a wife might have to pay alimony under a gender-neutral statute, the present statutes exempt her from that obligation.</p>
<p id="fbf8f149-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, as here, the State’s compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by a gender-neutral classification as one that gender classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the State cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of sex.</p>
<p id="fbf8f14a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the Supreme Court, on several occasions, has declared unconstitutional many laws that automatically allowed women economic benefits, such as when their husbands died, but permitted men the same benefits only if they proved dependence on their wives’ income. In Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 <span title="856" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-856">p. 856</span>U.S. 636 (1975), the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional a provision of the Social Security Act that allowed a widowed mother, but not a widowed father, to receive benefits based on the earnings of the deceased spouse. The Court said that the law was based on the stereotype “that male workers’ earnings are vital to the support of their families, while the earnings of female wage earners do not significantly contribute to their families’ support.”</p>
<p id="fbf8f14b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court applied <i>Weinberger</i> in Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), to hold unconstitutional a provision in the Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits program, whereby a woman automatically would receive benefits based on the earnings of her husband, but a man would receive such benefits only if he could prove that he received at least half of his support from his wife. The Court declared the law unconstitutional because it was based, at least in part, on a “presumption that wives are usually dependent.” The Court said that “such assumptions do not suffice to justify a gender-based discrimination in the distribution of employment-related benefits.”</p>
<p id="fbf8f14c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Co., 446 U.S. 142 (1980), the Court applied the same principle to rule unconstitutional a state law that automatically allowed widows benefits, but only allowed widowers benefits if they proved that they were dependent on their wives’ income or were physically incapacitated. In all of these cases—<i>Orr</i>, <i>Weinberger</i>, <i>Goldfarb</i>, and <i>Wengler</i>—the Court rejected laws that benefited women because they were based on the stereotype of economically dependent women and economically independent men.</p>
<p id="fbf9185d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other stereotypes also have been rejected as a sufficient basis for gender classifications benefiting women. For example, in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, the Court declared unconstitutional a state policy of operating a nursing school that excluded men.</p>

<p id="fbf91864-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the narrow issue of whether a state statute that excludes males from enrolling in a state-supported professional nursing school violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbf91866-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are not in dispute. In 1884, the Mississippi Legislature created the Mississippi Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Mississippi, now the oldest state-supported all-female college in the United States. The school, known today as Mississippi University for Women (MUW), has from its inception limited its enrollment to women. Mississippi maintains no other single-sex public university or college. Thus, we are not faced with the question of whether States can provide “separate but equal” undergraduate institutions for males and females.</p>

Since 1974, he has worked as a nursing supervisor in a medical center in Columbus, the city in which MUW is located.

<p id="fbf93f79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decisions establish that the party seeking to uphold a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their gender must carry the burden of showing an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the classification. The burden is met only by showing at least that the classification serves “important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed” are “substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”</p>
<p id="fbf93f7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the test for determining the validity of a gender-based classification is straightforward, it must be applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females. Care must be taken in ascertaining whether the statutory objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions. Thus, if the statutory objective is to exclude or “protect” members of one gender because they are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.</p>
<p id="fbf93f7b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s primary justification for maintaining the single-sex admissions policy of MUW’s School of Nursing is that it compensates for discrimination against women and, therefore, constitutes educational affirmative action. In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened. However, we consistently have emphasized that “the mere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.”</p>
<p id="fbf93f7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is readily apparent that a State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification. Mississippi has made no showing that women lacked opportunities to obtain training in the field of nursing or to attain positions of leadership in that field when the MUW School of Nursing opened its door or that women currently are deprived of such opportunities. In fact, in 1970, the year before the School of Nursing’s first class enrolled, women earned 94 percent of the nursing baccalaureate degrees conferred in Mississippi and 98.6 percent of the degrees earned nationwide. As one would expect, the labor force reflects the same predominance of women in nursing. When MUW’s School of Nursing began operation, nearly 98 percent of all employed registered nurses were female.</p>
<p id="fbf93f7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather than compensate for discriminatory barriers faced by women, MUW’s policy of excluding males from admission to the School of Nursing tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman’s job. By assuring that Mississippi allots more openings in its state-supported nursing schools to women than it does to men, MUW’s admissions policy lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, we conclude that, although the State recited a “benign, compensatory purpose,” it failed to establish that the alleged objective is the actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification.</p>
<p id="fbf93f7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="858" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-858">p. 858</span>The policy is invalid also because it fails the second part of the equal protection test, for the State has made no showing that the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to its proposed compensatory objective. To the contrary, MUW’s policy of permitting men to attend classes as auditors fatally undermines its claim that women, at least those in the School of Nursing, are adversely affected by the presence of men.</p>
<p id="fbf93f7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MUW permits men who audit to participate fully in classes. Additionally, both men and women take part in continuing education courses offered by the School of Nursing, in which regular nursing students also can enroll. The uncontroverted record reveals that admitting men to nursing classes does not affect teaching style, that the presence of men in the classroom would not affect the performance of the female nursing students, and that men in coeducational nursing schools do not dominate the classroom. In sum, the record in this case is flatly inconsistent with the claim that excluding men from the School of Nursing is necessary to reach any of MUW’s educational goals.</p>

<p id="fbf93f81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s opinion bows deeply to conformity. Left without honor—indeed, held unconstitutional—is an element of diversity that has characterized much of American education and enriched much of American life. The Court in effect holds today that no State now may provide even a single institution of higher learning open only to women students. It gives no heed to the efforts of the State of Mississippi to provide abundant opportunities for young men and young women to attend coeducational institutions, and none to the preferences of the more than 40,000 young women who over the years have evidenced their approval of an all-women’s college by choosing Mississippi University for Women (MUW) over seven coeducational universities within the State.</p>
<p id="fbf93f82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is respondent significantly disadvantaged by MUW’s all-female tradition. His constitutional complaint is based upon a single asserted harm: that he must travel to attend the state-supported nursing schools that concededly are available to him. The Court characterizes this injury as one of “inconvenience.” This description is fair and accurate, though somewhat embarrassed by the fact that there is, of course, no constitutional right to attend a state-supported university in one’s home town. Thus the Court, to redress respondent’s injury of inconvenience, must rest its invalidation of MUW’s single-sex program on a mode of “sexual stereotype” reasoning that has no application whatever to the respondent or to the “wrong” of which he complains. At best this is anomalous. And ultimately the anomaly reveals legal error—that of applying a heightened equal protection standard, developed in cases of genuine sexual stereotyping, to a narrowly utilized state classification that provides an additional choice for women.</p>
<p id="fbf93f83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By applying heightened equal protection analysis to this case, the Court frustrates the liberating spirit of the Equal Protection Clause. It prohibits the States from providing women with an opportunity to choose the type of university they prefer. And yet it is these women whom the Court regards as the victims of an illegal, stereotyped perception of the role of women in our society. The Court reasons this way in a case in which no woman has complained, and the only complainant is a man who advances no claims on behalf of anyone else.</p>
<p id="fbf93f84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the practice of voluntarily chosen single-sex education is an honored tradition in our country, even if it now rarely exists in state colleges and universities. Mississippi’s accommodation of such student choices is legitimate because it <span title="859" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-859">p. 859</span>is completely consensual and is important because it permits students to decide for themselves the type of college education they think will benefit them most. Finally, Mississippi’s policy is substantially related to its long-respected objective.</p>

Yet in some cases the Court has upheld laws benefiting women even though they seem to be based on stereotypes. Michael M. v. Superior Court and Rostker v. Goldberg, which follow, both are cases in which the Court upheld gender classifications that appear to rest on stereotypes.</p>

<p id="fbf9669c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented in this case is whether California’s “statutory rape” law, §261.5 of the Cal. Penal Code Ann. violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 261.5 defines unlawful sexual intercourse as “an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years.” The statute thus makes men alone criminally liable for the act of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p id="fbf9669d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July 1978, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of Sonoma County, Cal., alleging that petitioner, then a 17&amp;#x00BD;-year-old male, had had unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18, in violation of §261.5. The evidence, adduced at a preliminary hearing showed that at approximately midnight on June 3, 1978, petitioner and two friends approached Sharon, a 16&amp;#x00BD;-year-old female, and her sister as they waited at a bus stop. Petitioner and Sharon, who had already been drinking, moved away from the others and began to kiss. After being struck in the face for rebuffing petitioner’s initial advances, Sharon submitted to sexual intercourse with petitioner. Prior to trial, petitioner sought to set aside the information on both state and federal constitutional grounds, asserting that §261.5 unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender. The trial court and the California Court of Appeal denied petitioner’s request for relief and petitioner sought review in the Supreme Court of California. The Supreme Court held that “section 261.5 discriminates on the basis of sex because only females may be victims, and only males may violate the section.”</p>
<p id="fbf9669e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he fact that the California Legislature criminalized the act of illicit sexual intercourse with a minor female is a sure indication of its intent or purpose to discourage that conduct. Precisely why the legislature desired that result is of course somewhat less clear. This Court has long recognized that “[i]nquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter,” United States v. O’Brien (1968), and the search for the “actual” or “primary” purpose of a statute is likely to be elusive. Here, for example, the individual legislators may have voted for the statute for a variety of reasons. Some legislators may have been <span title="860" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-860">p. 860</span>concerned about preventing teenage pregnancies, others about protecting young females from physical injury or from the loss of “chastity,” and still others about promoting various religious and moral attitudes towards premarital sex.</p>
<p id="fbf9669f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The justification for the statute offered by the State, and accepted by the Supreme Court of California, is that the legislature sought to prevent illegitimate teenage pregnancies. That finding, of course, is entitled to great deference. We are satisfied not only that the prevention of illegitimate pregnancy is at least one of the “purposes” of the statute, but also that the State has a strong interest in preventing such pregnancy. At the risk of stating the obvious, teenage pregnancies, which have increased dramatically over the last two decades, have significant social, medical, and economic consequences for both the mother and her child, and the State. Of particular concern to the State is that approximately half of all teenage pregnancies end in abortion. And of those children who are born, their illegitimacy makes them likely candidates to become wards of the State.</p>
<p id="fbf966a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not be medical doctors to discern that young men and young women are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse. Only women may become pregnant, and they suffer disproportionately the profound physical, emotional and psychological consequences of sexual activity. The statute at issue here protects women from sexual intercourse at an age when those consequences are particularly severe.</p>
<p id="fbf98db1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question thus boils down to whether a State may attack the problem of sexual intercourse and teenage pregnancy directly by prohibiting a male from having sexual intercourse with a minor female. We hold that such a statute is sufficiently related to the State’s objectives to pass constitutional muster. Because virtually all of the significant harmful and inescapably identifiable consequences of teenage pregnancy fall on the young female, a legislature acts well within its authority when it elects to punish only the participant who, by nature, suffers few of the consequences of his conduct. It is hardly unreasonable for a legislature acting to protect minor females to exclude them from punishment. Moreover, the risk of pregnancy itself constitutes a substantial deterrence to young females. No similar natural sanctions deter males. A criminal sanction imposed solely on males thus serves to roughly “equalize” the deterrents on the sexes.</p>
<p id="fbf98db2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, we cannot say that a gender-neutral statute would be as effective as the statute California has chosen to enact. The State persuasively contends that a gender-neutral statute would frustrate its interest in effective enforcement. Its view is that a female is surely less likely to report violations of the statute if she herself would be subject to criminal prosecution. In an area already fraught with prosecutorial difficulties, we decline to hold that the Equal Protection Clause requires a legislature to enact a statute so broad that it may well be incapable of enforcement.</p>
<p id="fbf98db3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the petitioner’s assertions, the statute does not rest on the assumption that males are generally the aggressors. It is instead an attempt by a legislature to prevent illegitimate teenage pregnancy by providing an additional deterrent for men. The age of the man is irrelevant since young men are as capable as older men of inflicting the harm sought to be prevented.</p>
<p id="fbf98db4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, with whom Justices <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span> and <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf98db5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the analytical framework provided by our precedents, I am convinced that there is only one proper resolution of this issue: the classification <span title="861" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-861">p. 861</span>must be declared unconstitutional. I fear that the Court reaches the opposite result by placing too much emphasis on the desirability of achieving the State’s asserted statutory goal—prevention of teenage pregnancy—and not enough emphasis on the fundamental question of whether the sex-based discrimination in the California statute is substantially related to the achievement of that goal.</p>
<p id="fbf98db6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of California vigorously asserts that the “important governmental objective” to be served by §261.5 is the prevention of teenage pregnancy. It claims that its statute furthers this goal by deterring sexual activity by males—the class of persons it considers more responsible for causing those pregnancies. But even assuming that prevention of teenage pregnancy is an important governmental objective and that it is in fact an objective of §261.5, California still has the burden of proving that there are fewer teenage pregnancies under its gender-based statutory rape law than there would be if the law were gender neutral. To meet this burden, the State must show that because its statutory rape law punishes only males, and not females, it more effectively deters minor females from having sexual intercourse.</p>
<p id="fbf98db7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, a State’s bare assertion that its gender-based statutory classification substantially furthers an important governmental interest is not enough to meet its burden of proof under Craig v. Boren. Rather, the State must produce evidence that will persuade the court that its assertion is true. The State has not produced such evidence in this case.</p>
<p id="fbf98db8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, there are at least two serious flaws in the State’s assertion that law enforcement problems created by a gender-neutral statutory rape law would make such a statute less effective than a gender-based statute in deterring sexual activity. First, the experience of other jurisdictions, and California itself, belies the plurality’s conclusion that a gender-neutral statutory rape law “may well be incapable of enforcement.” There are now at least 37 States that have enacted gender-neutral statutory rape laws. Although most of these laws protect young persons (of either sex) from the sexual exploitation of older individuals, the laws of Arizona, Florida, and Illinois permit prosecution of both minor females and minor males for engaging in mutual sexual conduct. California has introduced no evidence that those States have been handicapped by the enforcement problems the plurality finds so persuasive. Surely, if those States could provide such evidence, we might expect that California would have introduced it.</p>
<p id="fbf98db9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second flaw in the State’s assertion is that even assuming that a gender-neutral statute would be more difficult to enforce, the State has still not shown that those enforcement problems would make such a statute less effective than a gender-based statute in deterring minor females from engaging in sexual intercourse. Common sense, however, suggests that a gender-neutral statutory rape law is potentially a greater deterrent of sexual activity than a gender-based law, for the simple reason that a gender-neutral law subjects both men and women to criminal sanctions and thus arguably has a deterrent effect on twice as many potential violators. Even if fewer persons were prosecuted under the gender-neutral law, as the State suggests, it would still be true that twice as many persons would be subject to arrest. The State’s failure to prove that a gender-neutral law would be a less effective deterrent than a gender-based law, like the State’s failure to prove that a gender-neutral law would be difficult to enforce, should have led this Court to invalidate §261.5.</p>
<p id="fbf98dba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="862" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-862">p. 862</span>Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf98dbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Local custom and belief—rather than statutory laws of venerable but doubtful ancestry—will determine the volume of sexual activity among unmarried teenagers. The empirical evidence cited by the plurality demonstrates the futility of the notion that a statutory prohibition will significantly affect the volume of that activity or provide a meaningful solution to the problems created by it.</p>
<p id="fbf98dbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would have no doubt about the validity of a state law prohibiting all unmarried teenagers from engaging in sexual intercourse. The societal interests in reducing the incidence of venereal disease and teenage pregnancy are sufficient, in my judgment, to justify a prohibition of conduct that increases the risk of those harms. My conclusion that a nondiscriminatory prohibition would be constitutional does not help me answer the question whether a prohibition applicable to only half of the joint participants in the risk-creating conduct is also valid.</p>
<p id="fbf98dbd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my judgment, the fact that a class of persons is especially vulnerable to a risk that a statute is designed to avoid is a reason for making the statute applicable to that class. The argument that a special need for protection provides a rational explanation for an exemption is one I simply do not comprehend. In this case, the fact that a female confronts a greater risk of harm than a male is a reason for applying the prohibition to her—not a reason for granting her a license to use her own judgment on whether or not to assume the risk. Surely, if we examine the problem from the point of view of society’s interest in preventing the risk-creating conduct from occurring at all, it is irrational to exempt 50% of the potential violators. And, if we view the government’s interest as that of a parens patriae seeking to protect its subjects from harming themselves, the discrimination is actually perverse. Would a rational parent making rules for the conduct of twin children of opposite sex simultaneously forbid the son and authorize the daughter to engage in conduct that is especially harmful to the daughter? That is the effect of this statutory classification.</p>
<p id="fbf9b4ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even if my logic is faulty and there actually is some speculative basis for treating equally guilty males and females differently, I still believe that any such speculative justification would be outweighed by the paramount interest in evenhanded enforcement of the law. A rule that authorizes punishment of only one of two equally guilty wrongdoers violates the essence of the constitutional requirement that the sovereign must govern impartially.</p>

<p id="fbf9b4d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is whether the Military Selective Service Act violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in authorizing the President to require the registration of males and not females.</p>

<p id="fbf9b4d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress is given the power under the Constitution “To raise and support Armies,” “To provide and maintain a Navy,” and “To make Rules for the <span title="863" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-863">p. 863</span>Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” Pursuant to this grant of authority Congress has enacted the Military Selective Service Act. Section 3 of the Act, empowers the President, by proclamation, to require the registration of “every male citizen” and male resident aliens between the ages of 18 and 26. The purpose of this registration is to facilitate any eventual conscription: pursuant to §4(a) of the Act, those persons required to register are liable for training and service in the Armed Forces. The MSSA registration provision serves no other purpose beyond providing a pool for subsequent induction.</p>

<p id="fbf9b4d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whenever called upon to judge the constitutionality of an Act of Congress—“the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform,” Blodgett v. Holden (1927) (Holmes, J.)—the Court accords “great weight to the decisions of Congress.” The Congress is a coequal branch of government whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not, however, merely a case involving the customary deference accorded congressional decisions. The case arises in the context of Congress’ authority over national defense and military affairs, and perhaps in no other area has the Court accorded Congress greater deference.</p>
<p id="fbf9b4da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Gilligan v. Morgan (1973), the Court noted: “[I]t is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence. The complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments, subject always to civilian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches.”</p>
<p id="fbf9dbeb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one could deny that under the test of Craig v. Boren the Government’s interest in raising and supporting armies is an “important governmental interest.” Congress and its Committees carefully considered and debated two alternative means of furthering that interest: the first was to register only males for potential conscription, and the other was to register both sexes. Congress chose the former alternative. When that decision is challenged on equal protection grounds, the question a court must decide is not which alternative it would have chosen, had it been the primary decisionmaker, but whether that chosen by Congress denies equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p id="fbf9dbed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is quite different from several of the gender-based discrimination cases we have considered in that, despite appellees’ assertions, Congress did not act “unthinkingly” or “reflexively and not for any considered reason.” The question of registering women for the draft not only received considerable national attention and was the subject of wide-ranging public debate, but also was extensively considered by Congress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee. Hearings held by both Houses of Congress in response to the President’s request for authorization to register women adduced extensive testimony and evidence concerning the issue. These hearings built on other hearings held the <span title="864" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-864">p. 864</span>previous year addressed to the same question. The House declined to provide for the registration of women when it passed the Joint Resolution allocating funds for the Selective Service System. When the Senate considered the Joint Resolution, it defeated, after extensive debate, an amendment which in effect would have authorized the registration of women. As noted earlier, Congress in H. J. Res. 521 only authorized funds sufficient to cover the registration of males. The foregoing clearly establishes that the decision to exempt women from registration was not the “accidental by-product of a traditional way of thinking about females.”</p>
<p id="fbf9dbee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MSSA established a plan for maintaining “adequate armed strength . . . to insure the security of [the] Nation.” Registration is the first step “in a united and continuous process designed to raise an army speedily and efficiently.” Congress provided for the reactivation of registration in order to “provid[e] the means for the early delivery of inductees in an emergency.” Any assessment of the congressional purpose and its chosen means must therefore consider the registration scheme as a prelude to a draft in a time of national emergency. Any other approach would not be testing the Act in light of the purposes Congress sought to achieve.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress determined that any future draft, which would be facilitated by the registration scheme, would be characterized by a need for combat troops. Women as a group, however, unlike men as a group, are not eligible for combat. The restrictions on the participation of women in combat in the Navy and Air Force are statutory. The Army and Marine Corps preclude the use of women in combat as a matter of established policy. Congress specifically recognized and endorsed the exclusion of women from combat in exempting women from registration.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress’s decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them. The Senate Report [stated]: “In the Committee’s view, the starting point for any discussion of the appropriateness of registering women for the draft is the question of the proper role of women in combat. . . . The policy precluding the use of women in combat is, in the Committee’s view, the most important reason, for not including women in a registration system.”</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason women are exempt from registration is not because military needs can be met by drafting men. This is not a case of Congress arbitrarily choosing to burden one of two similarly situated groups, such as would be the case with an all-black or all-white, or an all-Catholic or all-Lutheran, or an all-Republican or all-Democratic registration. Men and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress’s decision to authorize the registration of only men, therefore, does not violate the Due Process Clause. The exemption of women from registration is not only sufficiently but also closely related to Congress’s purpose in authorizing registration. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Congress acted well within its constitutional authority when it authorized the registration of men, and not women, under the Military Selective Service Act.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="865" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-865">p. 865</span>Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I assume what has not been challenged in this case—that excluding women from combat positions does not offend the Constitution. Granting that, it is self-evident that if during mobilization for war, all noncombat military positions must be filled by combat-qualified personnel available to be moved into combat positions, there would be no occasion whatsoever to have any women in the Army, whether as volunteers or inductees. The Court appears to say, that Congress concluded as much and that we should accept that judgment even though the serious view of the Executive Branch, including the responsible military services, is to the contrary. The Court’s position in this regard is most unpersuasive. I perceive little, if any, indication that Congress itself concluded that every position in the military, no matter how far removed from combat, must be filled, with combat-ready men. Common sense and experience in recent wars, where women volunteers were employed in substantial numbers, belie this view of reality. It should not be ascribed to Congress, particularly in the face of the testimony of military authorities, hereafter referred to, that there would be a substantial number of positions in the services that could be filled by women both in peacetime and during mobilization, even though they are ineligible for combat.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would also have little difficulty agreeing to a reversal if all the women who could serve in wartime without adversely affecting combat readiness could predictably be obtained through volunteers. In that event, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment would not require the United States to go through, and a large segment of the population to be burdened with, the expensive and essentially useless procedure of registering women. But again I cannot agree with the Court, that Congress concluded or that the legislative record indicates that each of the services could rely on women volunteers to fill all the positions for which they might be eligible in the event of mobilization. On the contrary, the record as I understand it, supports the District Court’s finding that the services would have to conscript at least 80,000 persons to fill positions for which combat-ready men would not be required. The consistent position of the Defense Department representatives was that their best estimate of the number of women draftees who could be used productively by the services in the event of a major mobilization would be approximately 80,000 over the first six months. Except for a single, unsupported, and ambiguous statement in the Senate Report to the effect that “women volunteers would fill the requirements for women,” there is no indication that Congress rejected the Defense Department’s figures or relied upon an alternative set of figures.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also submits that because the primary purpose of registration and conscription is to supply combat troops and because the great majority of noncombat positions must be filled by combat-trained men ready to be rotated into combat, the absolute number of positions for which women would be eligible is so small as to be de minimis and of no moment for equal protection purposes, especially in light of the administrative burdens involved in registering all women of suitable age. There is some sense to this; but at least on the record before us, the number of women who could be used in the military without sacrificing combat readiness is not at all small or insubstantial, and administrative convenience has not been sufficient justification for the kind of outright gender-based discrimination involved in registering and conscripting men but no women at all.</p>
<p id="fbf9dbf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="866" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-866">p. 866</span>As I understand the record, then, in order to secure the personnel it needs during mobilization, the Government cannot rely on volunteers and must register and draft not only to fill combat positions and those noncombat positions that must be filled by combat-trained men, but also to secure the personnel needed for jobs that can be performed by persons ineligible for combat without diminishing military effectiveness. The claim is that in providing for the latter category of positions, Congress is free to register and draft only men. I discern no adequate justification for this kind of discrimination between men and women. Accordingly, with all due respect, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbfa0211-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under §215 of the Social Security Act, old-age insurance benefits are computed on the basis of the wage earner’s “average monthly wage” earned during his “benefit computation years” which are the “elapsed years” (reduced by five) during which the wage earner’s covered wages were highest. Until a 1972 amendment, “elapsed years” depended upon the sex of the wage earner. Section 215(b)(3) prescribed that the number of “elapsed years” for a male wage earner would be three higher than for an otherwise similarly situated female wage earner; for a male, the number of “elapsed years” equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which he attained age 65; for a female the number of “elapsed years” equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which she attained age 62. Thus, a male born in 1900 would have 14 “elapsed years” on retirement at age 65 but a female born in the same year would have only 11. Accordingly, a female wage earner could exclude from the computation of her “average monthly wage” three more lower earning years than a similarly situated male wage earner could exclude. This would result in a slightly higher “average monthly wage” and a correspondingly higher level of monthly old-age benefits for the retired female wage earner.</p>
<p id="fbfa0212-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To withstand scrutiny under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, “classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Craig v. Boren (1976). Reduction of the disparity in economic condition between men and women caused by the long history of discrimination against women has been recognized as such an important governmental objective.</p>
<p id="fbfa0213-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more favorable treatment of the female wage earner enacted here was not a result of “archaic and overbroad generalizations” about women, or of “the roletyping society has long imposed” upon women, such as casual assumptions that women are “the weaker sex” or are more likely to be child-rearers or <span title="867" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-867">p. 867</span>dependents. Rather, “the only discernible purpose of [§215’s more favorable treatment is] the permissible one of redressing our society’s longstanding disparate treatment of women.”</p>
<p id="fbfa2924-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The challenged statute operated directly to compensate women for past economic discrimination. Retirement benefits under the Act are based on past earnings. But as we have recognized: “Whether from overt discrimination or from the socialization process of a male-dominated culture, the job market is inhospitable to the woman seeking any but the lowest paid jobs.” Thus, allowing women, who as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men, to eliminate additional low-earning years from the calculation of their retirement benefits works directly to remedy some part of the effect of past discrimination.</p>
</div></div>

<p id="fbfa2925-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another example of the Court allowing gender classifications benefiting women to compensate for differences in opportunity is Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975). In Schlesinger v. Ballard, the Court upheld a Navy regulation that required the discharge of male officers who had gone 9 years without a promotion but allowed women to remain 13 years without a promotion. The Court decided that this was constitutional because men had more opportunities for promotion than women. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court, explained, “Congress may quite rationally have believed that women line officers had less opportunity for promotion than did their male counterparts, and that a longer period of tenure for women officers would, therefore, be consistent with the goal to provide women officers with fair and equitable career advancement programs.”</p>
<p id="fbfa2926-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, the Court has not considered a constitutional challenge to an affirmative action program designed to benefit women. Although intermediate scrutiny is the test for all gender-based classifications, many of the same issues will arise as in the context of race-based affirmative action, including what interests justify affirmative action and what techniques are permissible.</p>

Virginia (1996). For reasons to follow, we conclude §1409 satisfies this standard. Given that determination, we need not decide whether some lesser degree of scrutiny pertains because the statute implicates Congress’ immigration and naturalization power.</p>
<p id="fbfa7766-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutory distinction relevant in this case, then, is that §1409(a)(4) requires one of three affirmative steps to be taken if the citizen parent is the father, but not if the citizen parent is the mother: legitimation; a declaration of paternity under oath by the father; or a court order of paternity.

<p id="fbfa9e78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first governmental interest to be served is the importance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists. In the case of the mother, the relation is verifiable from the birth itself. The mother’s status is documented in most instances by the birth certificate or hospital records and the witnesses who attest to her having given birth.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of the father, the uncontestable fact is that he need not be present at the birth. If he is present, furthermore, that circumstance is not incontrovertible proof of fatherhood. Fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to the proof of biological parenthood. The imposition of a different set of rules for making that legal determination with respect to fathers and mothers is neither surprising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective. Section 1409(a)(4)’s provision of three options for a father seeking to establish paternity—legitimation, paternity oath, and court order of paternity—is designed to ensure an acceptable documentation of paternity.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners argue that the requirement of §1409(a)(1), that a father provide clear and convincing evidence of parentage, is sufficient to achieve the end of establishing paternity, given the sophistication of modern DNA tests. Section 1409(a)(1) does not actually mandate a DNA test, however. The Constitution, moreover, does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing paternity, even if that mechanism arguably might be the most scientifically advanced method. With respect to DNA testing, the expense, reliability, and availability of such testing in various parts of the world may have been of particular concern to Congress. The requirement of §1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable conclusion by the legislature that the satisfaction of one of several alternatives will suffice to establish the blood link between father and child required as a predicate to the child’s acquisition of citizenship. Given the proof of motherhood that is inherent in birth itself, it is unremarkable that Congress did not require the same affirmative steps of mothers.</p>

<p id="fbfa9e7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second important governmental interest furthered in a substantial manner by §1409(a)(4) is the determination to ensure that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a relationship that is recognized, as a formal matter, by the law, but one that consists of the real, everyday ties that provide a connection between child and citizen parent and, in turn, the United States. In the case of a citizen mother and a child born overseas, the opportunity for a meaningful relationship between citizen parent and child inheres in the very event of birth, an event so often critical to our constitutional and statutory understandings of citizenship. The mother knows that the child is in being and is hers and has an initial point of contact with him. There is at least an opportunity for mother and child to develop a real, meaningful relationship.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="871" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-871">p. 871</span>The same opportunity does not result from the event of birth, as a matter of biological inevitability, in the case of the unwed father. Given the 9-month interval between conception and birth, it is not always certain that a father will know that a child was conceived, nor is it always clear that even the mother will be sure of the father’s identity. This fact takes on particular significance in the case of a child born overseas and out of wedlock. One concern in this context has always been with young people, men for the most part, who are on duty with the Armed Forces in foreign countries.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we turn to the conditions which prevail today, we find that the passage of time has produced additional and even more substantial grounds to justify the statutory distinction. The ease of travel and the willingness of Americans to visit foreign countries have resulted in numbers of trips abroad that must be of real concern when we contemplate the prospect of accepting petitioners’ argument, which would mandate, contrary to Congress’ wishes, citizenship by male parentage subject to no condition save the father’s previous length of residence in this country. In 1999 alone, Americans made almost 25 million trips abroad, excluding trips to Canada and Mexico. Visits to Canada and Mexico add to this figure almost 34 million additional visits. And the average American overseas traveler spent 15.1 nights out of the United States in 1999.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Principles of equal protection do not require Congress to ignore this reality. To the contrary, these facts demonstrate the critical importance of the Government’s interest in ensuring some opportunity for a tie between citizen father and foreign born child which is a reasonable substitute for the opportunity manifest between mother and child at the time of birth. Indeed, especially in light of the number of Americans who take short sojourns abroad, the prospect that a father might not even know of the conception is a realistic possibility. Even if a father knows of the fact of conception, moreover, it does not follow that he will be present at the birth of the child. Thus, unlike the case of the mother, there is no assurance that the father and his biological child will ever meet. Without an initial point of contact with the child by a father who knows the child is his own, there is no opportunity for father and child to begin a relationship. Section 1409 takes the unremarkable step of ensuring that such an opportunity, inherent in the event of birth as to the mother-child relationship, exists between father and child before citizenship is conferred upon the latter.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The importance of the governmental interest at issue here is too profound to be satisfied merely by conducting a DNA test. The fact of paternity can be established even without the father’s knowledge, not to say his presence. Paternity can be established by taking DNA samples even from a few strands of hair, years after the birth. Yet scientific proof of biological paternity does nothing, by itself, to ensure contact between father and child during the child’s minority.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress is well within its authority in refusing, absent proof of at least the opportunity for the development of a relationship between citizen parent and child, to commit this country to embracing a child as a citizen entitled as of birth to the full protection of the United States, to the absolute right to enter its borders, and to full participation in the political process. If citizenship is to be conferred by the unwitting means petitioners urge, so that its acquisition abroad bears little relation to the realities of the child’s own ties and allegiances, it is for Congress, not this Court, to make that determination. Congress has not taken that path but has instead chosen, by means of §1409, to ensure in the case of father and child the opportunity for a relationship to develop, an <span title="872" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-872">p. 872</span>opportunity which the event of birth itself provides for the mother and child. It should be unobjectionable for Congress to require some evidence of a minimal opportunity for the development of a relationship with the child in terms the male can fulfill.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners and their amici argue in addition that, rather than fulfilling an important governmental interest, §1409 merely embodies a gender-based stereotype. Although the above discussion should illustrate that, contrary to petitioners’ assertions, §1409 addresses an undeniable difference in the circumstance of the parents at the time a child is born, it should be noted, furthermore, that the difference does not result from some stereotype, defined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis. There is nothing irrational or improper in the recognition that at the moment of birth—a critical event in the statutory scheme and in the whole tradition of citizenship law—the mother’s knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have been established in a way not guaranteed in the case of the unwed father. This is not a stereotype.</p>
<p id="fbfa9e83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To fail to acknowledge even our most basic biological differences—such as the fact that a mother must be present at birth but the father need not be—risks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it. Mechanistic classification of all our differences as stereotypes would operate to obscure those misconceptions and prejudices that are real. The distinction embodied in the statutory scheme here at issue is not marked by misconception and prejudice, nor does it show disrespect for either class. The difference between men and women in relation to the birth process is a real one, and the principle of equal protection does not forbid Congress to address the problem at hand in a manner specific to each gender.</p>

While the Court invokes heightened scrutiny, the manner in which it explains and applies this standard is a stranger to our precedents.

<p id="fbfac597-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sex-based statutes, even when accurately reflecting the way most men or women behave, deny individuals opportunity. Such generalizations must be viewed not in isolation, but in the context of our Nation’s “long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.” Sex-based generalizations both reflect and reinforce “fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.”</p>
<p id="fbfac598-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, a party who seeks to defend a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of sex “must carry the burden of showing an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the classification.” The defender of the classification meets this burden “only by showing at least that the classification serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.’”</p>
<p id="fbfac599-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Heightened scrutiny does not countenance justifications that “rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.” Rational basis review, by contrast, is much more tolerant of the use of broad generalizations about different classes of individuals, so long as the classification is not arbitrary or irrational. Moreover, overbroad sex-based generalizations are impermissible even when they enjoy empirical support.</p>
<p id="fbfac59a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most important difference between heightened scrutiny and rational basis review, of course, is the required fit between the means employed and the ends served. Under heightened scrutiny, the discriminatory means must be “substantially related” to an actual and important governmental interest. Under rational basis scrutiny, the means need only be “rationally related” to a conceivable and legitimate state end. The fact that other means are better suited to the achievement of governmental ends therefore is of no moment under rational basis review. But because we require a much tighter fit between means and ends under heightened scrutiny, the availability of sex-neutral alternatives to a sex-based classification is often highly probative of the validity of the classification.</p>

<p id="fbfac59c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court recites the governing substantive standard for heightened scrutiny of sex-based classifications, but departs from the guidance of our precedents concerning such classifications in several ways.</p>
<p id="fbfac59d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the majority hypothesizes about the interests served by the statute and fails adequately to inquire into the actual purposes of §1409(a)(4). The Court also does not always explain adequately the importance of the interests that it claims to be served by the provision. The majority also fails carefully to consider whether the sex-based classification is being used impermissibly “as a proxy for other, more germane bases of classification,” and instead casually dismisses the relevance of available sex-neutral alternatives. And, contrary to the majority’s conclusion, the fit between the means and ends of §1409(a)(4) is far too attenuated for the provision to survive heightened scrutiny. In all, the majority opinion represents far less than the rigorous application of heightened scrutiny that our precedents require.</p>

<p id="fbfac59f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the Court, “[t]he first governmental interest to be served is the importance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists.” The majority does not elaborate on the importance of this interest, which presumably lies in preventing fraudulent conveyances of citizenship. Nor does the majority demonstrate that this is one of the actual purposes of §1409(a)(4). Assuming that Congress actually had this purpose in mind in enacting parts of §1409(a)(4), the INS does not appear to rely on this interest in its effort to sustain §1409(a)(4)’s sex-based classification. In light of the reviewing court’s duty to “determine whether the proffered justification is ‘exceedingly persuasive,’” <span title="874" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-874">p. 874</span>this disparity between the majority’s defense of the statute and the INS’ proffered justifications is striking, to say the least.</p>
<p id="fbfac5a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The gravest defect in the Court’s reliance on this interest, however, is the insufficiency of the fit between §1409(a)(4)’s discriminatory means and the asserted end. Section 1409(c) imposes no particular burden of proof on mothers wishing to convey citizenship to their children. By contrast, §1409(a)(1), which petitioners do not challenge before this Court, requires that “a blood relationship between the person and the father [be] established by clear and convincing evidence.” The virtual certainty of a biological link that modern DNA testing affords reinforces the sufficiency of §1409(a)(1).</p>
<p id="fbfac5a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If rational basis scrutiny were appropriate in this case, then the claim that “[t]he Constitution . . . does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing paternity[]” would have much greater force. But fidelity to the Constitution’s pledge of equal protection demands more when a facially sex-based classification is at issue. This is not because we sit in judgment of the wisdom of laws in one instance but not the other, but rather because of the potential for “injury . . . to personal dignity” that inheres in or accompanies so many sex-based classifications.</p>

<p id="fbfaecb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court states that “[t]he second important governmental interest furthered in a substantial manner by §1409(a)(4) is the determination to ensure that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a relationship that is recognized, as a formal matter, by the law, but one that consists of the real, everyday ties that provide a connection between child and citizen parent and, in turn, the United States.” The Court again fails to demonstrate that this was Congress’ actual purpose in enacting §1409(a)(4). The majority’s focus on “some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop . . . real, everyday ties,” in fact appears to be the type of hypothesized rationale that is insufficient under heightened scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbfaecb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming, as the majority does, that Congress was actually concerned about ensuring a “demonstrated opportunity” for a relationship, it is questionable whether such an opportunity qualifies as an “important” governmental interest apart from the existence of an actual relationship. By focusing on “opportunity” rather than reality, the majority presumably improves the chances of a sufficient means-end fit. But in doing so, it dilutes significantly the weight of the interest. It is difficult to see how, in this citizenship-conferral context, anyone profits from a “demonstrated opportunity” for a relationship in the absence of the fruition of an actual tie. Children who have an “opportunity” for such a tie with a parent, of course, may never develop an actual relationship with that parent. If a child grows up in a foreign country without any postbirth contact with the citizen parent, then the child’s never-realized “opportunity” for a relationship with the citizen seems singularly irrelevant to the appropriateness of granting citizenship to that child. Likewise, where there is an actual relationship, it is the actual relationship that does all the work in rendering appropriate a grant of citizenship, regardless of when and how the opportunity for that relationship arose.</p>
<p id="fbfaecb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the present law, the statute on its face accords different treatment to a mother who is by nature present at birth and a father who is by choice present at birth even though those two individuals are similarly situated with respect to <span title="875" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-875">p. 875</span>the “opportunity” for a relationship. The mother can transmit her citizenship at birth, but the father cannot do so in the absence of at least one other affirmative act. The different statutory treatment is solely on account of the sex of the similarly situated individuals. This type of treatment is patently inconsistent with the promise of equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="fbfaecb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the idea that a mother’s presence at birth supplies adequate assurance of an opportunity to develop a relationship while a father’s presence at birth does not would appear to rest only on an overbroad sex-based generalization. A mother may not have an opportunity for a relationship if the child is removed from his or her mother on account of alleged abuse or neglect, or if the child and mother are separated by tragedy, such as disaster or war, of the sort apparently present in this case. There is no reason, other than stereotype, to say that fathers who are present at birth lack an opportunity for a relationship on similar terms. The “[p]hysical differences between men and women[]” therefore do not justify §1409(a)(4)’s discrimination.</p>
<p id="fbfaecb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one should mistake the majority’s analysis for a careful application of this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence concerning sex-based classifications. Today’s decision instead represents a deviation from a line of cases in which we have vigilantly applied heightened scrutiny to such classifications to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred. I trust that the depth and vitality of these precedents will ensure that today’s error remains an aberration.</p>

But because his parents were not married and his father was the U.S. citizen, Morales-Santana was entitled to U.S. citizenship only if his father had lived in the United States for at least 10 years before his birth, with five of those years coming after the age of 14. But his father had moved from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic only 20 days before his 19th birthday. (In 1986, Congress amended the law, so that unmarried U.S.-citizen fathers need only to have lived in the United States for five years before their children are born, but it continues to apply different standards for men and women.)</p>
<p id="fbfaecba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the more favorable treatment for unmarried U.S.-citizen mothers rested on “overbroad generalizations,” which perpetuate stereotypes that require women “to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver” while at the same time working against men who do “exercise responsibility for raising their children.” The Court said that laws which treat men and women differently can survive a constitutional challenge only if the government can show both that the distinction serves an important purpose and that there is a close fit between the purpose and the method chosen to achieve it. The Court said that the government failed to meet this test.</p>
<p id="fbfaecbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In terms of remedy, the Court said that extending the shorter residency requirements for unmarried mothers to unmarried fathers would put children <span title="876" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-876">p. 876</span>of a married U.S.-citizen parent at a disadvantage, which could not have been what Congress had intended. Instead, the court ruled, the longer residency requirement should apply to everyone, including (going forward) the children of unmarried U.S.-citizen mothers — at least until Congress can step in and “settle on a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any person on the basis of gender.”</p>

<p id="fbfaecbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This type of discrimination—sometimes referred to as “alienage classifications”—should be distinguished from national origin classifications that discriminate against individuals because of the country that a person, or his or her ancestors, came from.</p>
<p id="fbfaecbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although America is very much a nation of immigrants, discrimination against aliens long has been widespread. Whether it is founded on economic protectionism, or xenophobia, or other motivations, aliens frequently have been denied benefits and privileges accorded to citizens. The issue is when such discrimination is a denial of equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="fbfb13d0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aliens are protected from discrimination because the Equal Protection Clause explicitly says that no “person” shall be denied equal protection of the laws. The clause does not mention the word “citizen,” although it is used in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which also is found in §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Long ago, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), the U.S. Supreme Court declared, “The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not confined to the protection of citizens. . . . [Its] provisions are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN122E7_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N122E7_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">120</a></span></p>
<p id="fbfb13d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Often state and local laws that discriminate against aliens can be challenged on preemption grounds as well as for violating equal protection. The Supreme Court has held that federal immigration laws wholly occupy the field and preempt state efforts to regulate immigration.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN122F2_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N122F2_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">121</a></span> For example, in Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1 (1982), the Supreme Court used preemption analysis to invalidate a state law denying resident aliens in-state tuition at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p id="fbfb13d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes state and local laws can be challenged both based on equal protection and on preemption analysis. In Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971), presented below, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law denying welfare benefits to aliens. The Court found both that it violated equal protection and that it was preempted by federal control over the field of immigration law.</p>

There are, however, several exceptions where less than strict scrutiny is used. Subsection 2 describes the case law establishing that alienage classifications related to self-government and the democratic process need only meet rational basis review. Subsection 3 discusses the use of rational basis review for federal laws that discriminate against aliens. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has plenary power to regulate immigration and thus has been deferential to federal statutes and presidential orders that discriminate against aliens. Finally, subsection 4 discusses the protection for undocumented aliens under equal protection.</p>

<p id="fbfb3aef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are welfare cases. The issue here is whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents a State from conditioning welfare benefits either (a) upon the beneficiary’s possession of United States citizenship, or (b) if the beneficiary is an alien, upon his having resided in this country for a specified number of years. The facts are not in dispute.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, from Arizona, concerns the State’s participation in federal categorical assistance programs. They are supported in part by federal grants-in-aid and are administered by the States under federal guidelines. Arizona Rev. Stat. Ann. §46233 reads: “A. No person shall be entitled to general assistance who does not meet and maintain the following requirements: 1. Is a citizen of the United States, or has resided in the United States a total of fifteen years. . . .”</p>
<p id="fbfb3af1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Carmen Richardson, at the institution of this suit in July 1969, was 64 years of age. She is a lawfully admitted resident alien. She emigrated from Mexico in 1956 and since then has resided continuously in Arizona. She became permanently and totally disabled. She also met all other requirements for eligibility for APTD benefits except the 15-year residency specified for aliens. She applied for benefits but was denied relief solely because of the residency provision.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellants argue initially that the States, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, may favor United States citizens over aliens in the distribution of welfare benefits. It is said that this distinction involves no “invidious discrimination” for the State is not discriminating with respect to race or nationality.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment provides, “[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” It has long been settled, and it is not disputed here, that the term “person” in this context encompasses lawfully admitted resident aliens as well as citizens of the United <span title="878" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-878">p. 878</span>States and entitles both citizens and aliens to the equal protection of the laws of the State in which they reside.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under traditional equal protection principles, a State retains broad discretion to classify as long as its classification has a reasonable basis. This is so in “the area of economics and social welfare.” But the Court’s decisions have established that classifications based on alienage, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. Aliens as a class are a prime example of a “discrete and insular” minority (see United States v. Carolene Products Co., n.4 (1938)) for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arizona seek[s] to justify [its] restrictions on the eligibility of aliens for public assistance solely on the basis of a State’s “special public interest” in favoring its own citizens over aliens in the distribution of limited resources such as welfare benefits. It is true that this Court on occasion has upheld state statutes that treat citizens and noncitizens differently, the ground for distinction having been that such laws were necessary to protect special interests of the State or its citizens. [W]e conclude that a State’s desire to preserve limited welfare benefits for its own citizens is inadequate to justify restricting benefits to citizens and longtime resident aliens.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]s the Court recognized in <i>Shapiro</i> [in declaring unconstitutional durational residency requirements for welfare]: “[A] State has a valid interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of its programs. It may legitimately attempt to limit its expenditures, whether for public assistance, public education, or any other program. But a State may not accomplish such a purpose by invidious distinctions between classes of its citizens. . . . The saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification.” Since an alien as well as a citizen is a “person” for equal protection purposes, a concern for fiscal integrity is no more compelling a justification for the questioned classification in these cases than it was in <i>Shapiro</i>.</p>
<p id="fbfb3af7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold that a state statute that denies welfare benefits to resident aliens and one that denies them to aliens who have not resided in the United States for a specified number of years violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
</div></div>


<p id="fbfb3af8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court applied <i>Graham</i> in two cases decided in 1973: Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634 (1973), and In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717 (1973). In <i>Sugarman</i>, the <span title="879" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-879">p. 879</span>Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a New York law that prevented aliens from holding civil service jobs. The Court said that excluding aliens denied equal protection and that a “flat ban on the employment of aliens in positions that have little, if any, relation to a State’s legitimate interest, cannot withstand scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment.”</p>
<p id="fbfb3af9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In re Griffiths invalidated as violating equal protection a state law that excluded aliens from being licensed as attorneys. The Court reaffirmed that strict scrutiny was the appropriate test for discrimination against aliens and held that it was impermissible for states to require citizenship as a condition for practicing law.</p>
<p id="fbfb620a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court applied these decisions in later cases. In Examining Board of Engineers, Architects &amp; Surveyors v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572 (1976), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Puerto Rico statute that permitted only United States citizens to engage in the private practice of engineering. The Court said that the earlier decisions “establish that state classifications based on alienage are subject to strict judicial scrutiny.” The Court said that excluding aliens from private practice as engineers has no “rational relationship to skill, competence, or financial responsibility.”</p>
<p id="fbfb620b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, in Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1 (1977), the Supreme Court used strict scrutiny to invalidate a New York law that limited financial aid for higher education to citizens, those who had applied for citizenship, and those who declared an intent to apply as soon as they were eligible. The Court emphasized the discriminatory nature of the statute, observing that the law “is directed at aliens and . . . only aliens are harmed by it.”</p>

<p id="fbfb8928-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Burger</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbfb8929-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We noted probable jurisdiction in this case to consider whether a State may constitutionally limit the appointment of members of its police force to citizens of the United States. The appellant, Edmund Foley, is an alien eligible in due course to become a naturalized citizen, who is lawfully in this country as a permanent resident. He applied for appointment as a New York State trooper, a position which is filled on the basis of competitive examinations. Pursuant to a New York statute, state authorities refused to allow Foley to take the examination. The statute provides: “No person shall be appointed to the New York state police force unless he shall be a citizen of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fbfb892a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant claims that the relevant New York statute violates his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. The decisions of this Court with regard to the rights of aliens living in our society have reflected fine, and often difficult, questions of values. As a Nation we exhibit extraordinary hospitality to those who <span title="880" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-880">p. 880</span>come to our country, which is not surprising for we have often been described as “a nation of immigrants.” Indeed, aliens lawfully residing in this society have many rights which are accorded to noncitizens by few other countries. Our cases generally reflect a close scrutiny of restraints imposed by States on aliens.</p>
<p id="fbfb892b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we have never suggested that such legislation is inherently invalid, nor have we held that all limitations on aliens are suspect.</p>
<p id="fbfb892c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be inappropriate, however, to require every statutory exclusion of aliens to clear the high hurdle of “strict scrutiny,” because to do so would “obliterate all the distinctions between citizens and aliens, and thus depreciate the historic values of citizenship.” The act of becoming a citizen is more than a ritual with no content beyond the fanfare of ceremony. A new citizen has become a member of a Nation, part of a people distinct from others. The individual, at that point, belongs to the polity and is entitled to participate in the processes of democratic decision-making. Accordingly, we have recognized “a State’s historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democratic political institutions,” part of the sovereign’s obligation “‘to preserve the basic conception of a political community.’”</p>
<p id="fbfb892d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practical consequence of this theory is that “our scrutiny will not be so demanding where we deal with matters firmly within a State’s constitutional prerogatives.” The State need only justify its classification by a showing of some rational relationship between the interest sought to be protected and the limiting classification. This is not intended to denigrate the valuable contribution of aliens who benefit from our traditional hospitality. It is no more than recognition of the fact that a democratic society is ruled by its people. Thus, it is clear that a State may deny aliens the right to vote, or to run for elective office, for these lie at the heart of our political institutions. Similar considerations support a legislative determination to exclude aliens from jury service. Likewise, we have recognized that citizenship may be a relevant qualification for fulfilling those “important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions,” held by “officers who participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy.” This is not because our society seeks to reserve the better jobs to its members. Rather, it is because this country entrusts many of its most important policy responsibilities to these officers, the discretionary exercise of which can often more immediately affect the lives of citizens than even the ballot of a voter or the choice of a legislator. In sum, then, it represents the choice, and right, of the people to be governed by their citizen peers. To effectuate this result, we must necessarily examine each position in question to determine whether it involves discretionary decisionmaking, or execution of policy, which substantially affects members of the political community.</p>
<p id="fbfb892e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A discussion of the police function is essentially a description of one of the basic functions of government, especially in a complex modern society where police presence is pervasive. The police function fulfills a most fundamental obligation of government to its constituency. Police officers in the ranks do not formulate policy, per se, but they are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers. The execution of the broad powers vested in them affects members of the public significantly and often in the most sensitive areas of daily life. Our Constitution, of course, provides safeguards to persons, homes and possessions, as well as guidance to police officers. And few countries, if any, provide more protection to individuals by limitations on the power and discretion of the police. Nonetheless, police may, <span title="881" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-881">p. 881</span>in the exercise of their discretion, invade the privacy of an individual in public places. They may under some conditions break down a door to enter a dwelling or other building in the execution of a warrant, or without a formal warrant in very limited circumstances; they may stop vehicles traveling on public highways.</p>
<p id="fbfb892f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clearly the exercise of police authority calls for a very high degree of judgment and discretion, the abuse or misuse of which can have serious impact on individuals. In short, it would be as anomalous to conclude that citizens may be subjected to the broad discretionary powers of noncitizen police officers as it would be to say that judicial officers and jurors with power to judge citizens can be aliens. It is not surprising, therefore, that most States expressly confine the employment of police officers to citizens, whom the State may reasonably presume to be more familiar with and sympathetic to American traditions. In the enforcement and execution of the laws the police function is one where citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the particular position. A State may, therefore, consonant with the Constitution, confine the performance of this important public responsibility to citizens of the United States.</p>
<p id="fbfb8930-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbfb8931-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court upholds a law excluding aliens from public employment as state troopers. I do not agree with the Court that state troopers perform functions placing them within this “narro[w] . . . exception,” to our usual rule that discrimination against aliens is presumptively unconstitutional. Accordingly I dissent.</p>
<p id="fbfb8932-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one sense, of course, it is true that state troopers participate in the execution of public policy. Just as firefighters execute the public policy that fires should be extinguished, and sanitation workers execute the public policy that streets should be kept clean, state troopers execute the public policy that persons believed to have committed crimes should be arrested. But this fact simply demonstrates that the exception, if read without regard to its context, “would swallow the rule.”</p>
<p id="fbfbb043-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the phrase “execution of broad public policy” cannot be read to mean simply the carrying out of government programs, but rather must be interpreted to include responsibility for actually setting government policy pursuant to a delegation of substantial authority from the legislature. The head of an executive agency for example, charged with promulgating complex regulations under a statute, executes broad public policy in a sense that file clerks in the agency clearly do not. In short, those “elective or important nonelective” positions that involve broad policymaking responsibilities are the only state jobs from which aliens as a group may constitutionally be excluded. In my view, the job of state trooper is not one of those positions.</p>
<p id="fbfbb044-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one suggests that aliens as a class lack the intelligence or the courage to serve the public as police officers. The disqualifying characteristic is apparently a foreign allegiance which raises a doubt concerning trustworthiness and loyalty so pervasive that a flat ban against the employment of any alien in any law enforcement position is thought to be justified. But if the integrity of all aliens is suspect, why may not a State deny aliens the right to practice law? Are untrustworthy or disloyal lawyers more tolerable than untrustworthy or disloyal policemen? Or is the legal profession better able to detect such characteristics on an individual basis than is the police department? Unless the Court repudiates its <span title="882" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-882">p. 882</span>holding in <i>In re Griffiths</i> it must reject any conclusive presumption that aliens, as a class, are disloyal or untrustworthy.</p>
<p id="fbfbb045-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Court rejects this analysis, it should not uphold a statutory discrimination against aliens, as a class, without expressly identifying the group characteristic that justifies the discrimination. If the unarticulated characteristic is concern about possible disloyalty, it must equally disqualify aliens from the practice of law; yet the Court does not question the continuing vitality of its decision in <i>Griffiths</i>. Or if that characteristic is the fact that aliens do not participate in our democratic decisionmaking process, it is irrelevant to eligibility for this category of public service. If there is no group characteristic that explains the discrimination, one can only conclude that it is without any justification that has not already been rejected by the Court.</p>

<p id="fbfbb04b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Powell</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbfbd75c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question whether a State, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, may refuse to employ as elementary and secondary school teachers aliens who are eligible for United States citizenship but who refuse to seek naturalization. New York Education Law §3001(3) forbids certification as a public school teacher of any person who is not a citizen of the United States, unless that person has manifested an intention to apply for citizenship.</p>
<p id="fbfbd75d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Norwick was born in Scotland and is a subject of Great Britain. She has resided in this country since 1965 and is married to a United States citizen. Appellee Dachinger is a Finnish subject who came to this country in 1966 and also is married to a United States citizen. Both Norwick and Dachinger currently meet all of the educational requirements New York has set for certification as a public school teacher, but they consistently have refused to seek citizenship in spite of their eligibility to do so. Norwick applied in 1973 for a teaching certificate covering nursery school through sixth grade, and Dachinger sought a certificate covering the same grades in 1975. Both applications were denied because of appellees’ failure to meet the requirements of §3001(3).</p>
<p id="fbfbd75e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule for governmental functions, which is an exception to the general standard applicable to classifications based on alienage, rests on important principles inherent in the Constitution. The distinction between citizens and aliens, though ordinarily irrelevant to private activity, is fundamental to the definition and government of a State. The Constitution itself refers to the distinction no less than 11 times, indicating that the status of citizenship was meant to have significance in the structure of our government. The assumption of that status, whether by birth or naturalization, denotes an association with the polity which, in a democratic republic, exercises the powers of governance. The form of this association is important: an oath of allegiance or similar ceremony cannot substitute for the unequivocal legal bond citizenship represents. It is because of this special significance of citizenship that governmental entities, when exercising the functions of government, have wider latitude in limiting the participation of noncitizens.</p>
<p id="fbfbd75f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether, for purposes of equal protection analysis, teaching in public schools constitutes a governmental function, we look to the role of <span title="883" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-883">p. 883</span>public education and to the degree of responsibility and discretion teachers possess in fulfilling that role. Each of these considerations supports the conclusion that public school teachers may be regarded as performing a task “that go[es] to the heart of representative government.”</p>
<p id="fbfbd760-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public education, like the police function, “fulfills a most fundamental obligation of government to its constituency.” The importance of public schools in the preparation of individuals for participation as citizens, and in the preservation of the values on which our society rests, long has been recognized by our decisions.</p>
<p id="fbfbd761-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within the public school system, teachers play a critical part in developing students’ attitude toward government and understanding of the role of citizens in our society. Alone among employees of the system, teachers are in direct, day-to-day contact with students both in the classrooms and in the other varied activities of a modern school. In shaping the students’ experience to achieve educational goals, teachers by necessity have wide discretion over the way the course material is communicated to students. They are responsible for presenting and explaining the subject matter in a way that is both comprehensible and inspiring. No amount of standardization of teaching materials or lesson plans can eliminate the personal qualities a teacher brings to bear in achieving these goals. Further, a teacher serves as a role model for his students, exerting a subtle but important influence over their perceptions and values. Thus, through both the presentation of course materials and the example he sets, a teacher has an opportunity to influence the attitudes of students toward government, the political process, and a citizen’s social responsibilities. This influence is crucial to the continued good health of a democracy.</p>
<p id="fbfbd762-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, it is clear that all public school teachers, and not just those responsible for teaching the courses most directly related to government, history, and civic duties, should help fulfill the broader function of the public school system. Teachers, regardless of their specialty, may be called upon to teach other subjects, including those expressly dedicated to political and social subjects. More importantly, a State properly may regard all teachers as having an obligation to promote civic virtues and understanding in their classes, regardless of the subject taught.</p>
<p id="fbfbd763-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly a State also may take account of a teacher’s function as an example for students, which exists independently of particular classroom subjects. In light of the foregoing considerations, we think it clear that public school teachers come well within the “governmental function” principle recognized in <i>Sugarman</i> and <i>Foley</i>. Accordingly, the Constitution requires only that a citizenship requirement applicable to teaching in the public schools bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.</p>
<p id="fbfbd764-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the legitimacy of the State’s interest in furthering the educational goals outlined above is undoubted, it remains only to consider whether §3001(3) bears a rational relationship to this interest. The restriction is carefully framed to serve its purpose, as it bars from teaching only those aliens who have demonstrated their unwillingness to obtain United States citizenship. Appellees, and aliens similarly situated, in effect have chosen to classify themselves. They prefer to retain citizenship in a foreign country with the obligations it entails of primary duty and loyalty. They have rejected the open invitation extended to qualify for eligibility to teach by applying for citizenship in this country. The people of New York, acting through their elected representatives, have made a <span title="884" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-884">p. 884</span>judgment that citizenship should be a qualification for teaching the young of the State in the public schools, and §3001(3) furthers that judgment.</p>
<p id="fbfbd765-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbfbd766-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once again the Court is asked to rule upon the constitutionality of one of New York’s many statutes that impose a requirement of citizenship upon a person before that person may earn his living in a specified occupation. These New York statutes, for the most part, have their origin in the frantic and overreactive days of the First World War when attitudes of parochialism and fear of the foreigner were the order of the day. We are concerned here with elementary and secondary education in the public schools of New York State. We are not concerned with teaching at the college or graduate levels. It seems constitutionally absurd, to say the least, that in these lower levels of public education a Frenchman may not teach French or, indeed, an Englishwoman may not teach the grammar of the English language. The appellees, to be sure, are resident “aliens” in the technical sense, but there is not a word in the record that either appellee does not have roots in this country or is unqualified in anyway, other than the imposed requirement of citizenship, to teach. Both appellee Norwick and appellee Dachinger have been in this country for over 12 years. Each is married to a United States citizen. Each currently meets all the requirements, other than citizenship, that New York has specified for certification as a public school teacher. Each is willing, if required, to subscribe to an oath to support the Constitutions of the United States and of New York. Each lives in an American community, must obey its laws, and must pay all of the taxes citizens are obligated to pay.</p>
</div></div>


<p id="fbfbd767-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he New York classification is irrational. Is it better to employ a poor citizen teacher than an excellent resident alien teacher? Is it preferable to have a citizen who has never seen Spain or a Latin American country teach Spanish to eighth graders and to deny that opportunity to a resident alien who may have lived for 20 years in the culture of Spain or Latin America? The State will know how to select its teachers responsibly, wholly apart from citizenship, and can do so selectively and intelligently. That is the way to accomplish the desired result. An artificial citizenship bar is not a rational way. It is, instead, a stultifying provision. The route to “diverse and conflicting elements” and their being “brought together on a broad but common ground,” which the Court so emphasizes, is hardly to be achieved by disregarding some of the diverse elements that are available, competent, and contributory to the richness of our society and of the education it could provide.</p>
<p id="fbfbd768-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Cabell v. Chavez-Salido, 454 U.S. 432 (1982), the Supreme Court followed <i>Foley</i> and <i>Ambach</i> and held that a state may require citizenship for a person to be a probation officer. The Court said that probation officers serve both as law enforcement officers and also as teachers in the sense that they perform an educational function for those they supervise. The Court therefore used only the rational basis test and upheld the law.</p>
<p id="fbfbd769-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in Bernal v. Fainter, 467 U.S. 216 (1984), the Supreme Court refused to apply this exception to a state law that created a citizenship requirement for a <span title="885" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-885">p. 885</span>person to be a notary public. The Court reaffirmed that “[a]s a general matter, a state law that discriminates on the basis of alienage can be sustained only if it can withstand strict judicial scrutiny.” The Court emphasized that this is a “narrow” exception that applies only if it is specifically tailored to those who “participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy, and hence perform functions that go to the heart of representative government.” The Court said that notary publics do not perform responsibilities that go to the heart of representative government. Therefore, strict scrutiny was applied and the state law was deemed to violate equal protection.</p>

<p id="fbfbfe7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another exception to the usual rule of strict scrutiny for alienage classifications is where the discrimination is a result of a federal law. The Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government’s plenary power to control immigration requires judicial deference and that therefore only rational basis review is used if Congress has created the alienage classification or if it is the result of a presidential order.</p>
<p id="fbfbfe7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal statute that denied Medicaid benefits to aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and have resided for at least five years in the United States. The Court said that “the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. Since decisions in these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers, and since a wide variety of classifications must be defined in the light of changing political and economic circumstances, such decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary.”</p>
<p id="fbfbfe7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court thus drew a distinction between alienage classifications imposed by the federal government and those created by state and local governments. Strict scrutiny is used for the latter, but the Court said that the federal law was upheld because it was not “wholly irrational” and served the “legitimate” interests of the federal government in preserving the fiscal integrity of the program.</p>
<p id="fbfbfe7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in Hamptom v. Wong, 426 U.S. 88 (1976), the Supreme Court clarified this and articulated a distinction between decisions by Congress or the president and those by federal administrative agencies; rational basis review is used only for the former. The Court invalidated a federal civil service regulation that denied employment to aliens. The Court said that “if the rule were expressly mandated by the Congress or the President, we might presume that any interest which might rationally be served by the rule did in fact give rise to its adoption.” The Court therefore explained that if the civil service regulation had been adopted via a federal law or a presidential order, “it would be justified by the national interest in providing an incentive for aliens to become naturalized, or possibly even as providing the President with an expendable token for treaty negotiating purposes.”</p>
<p id="fbfbfe80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Civil Service Commission that adopted the regulation had no involvement in making decisions concerning immigration or foreign policy. Nor was there anything to “indicate that the Commission actually made any considered evaluation of the relative desirability of a simple exclusionary rule on the one <span title="886" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-886">p. 886</span>hand, or the value . . . of enlarging the pool of eligible employees on the other.” The Civil Service regulation was invalidated even though it would have been constitutional if adopted by other federal government institutions.</p>

<p id="fbfbfe8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbfbfe8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Appellants argue at the outset that undocumented aliens, because of their immigration status, are not “persons within the jurisdiction” of the State of Texas, and that they therefore have no right to the equal protection of Texas law. We reject this argument. Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien is surely a “person” in any ordinary sense of that term. Aliens, even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as “persons” guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Indeed, we have clearly held that the Fifth Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government. Although the congressional debate concerning §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was limited, that debate clearly confirms the understanding that the phrase “within its jurisdiction” was intended in a broad sense to offer the guarantee of equal protection to all within a State’s boundaries, and to all upon whom the State would impose the obligations of its laws. Indeed, it appears from those debates that Congress, by using the phrase “person within its jurisdiction,” sought expressly to ensure that the equal protection of the laws was provided to the alien population.</p>

<p id="fbfbfe8e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sheer incapability or lax enforcement of the laws barring entry into this country, coupled with the failure to establish an effective bar to the employment of undocumented aliens, has resulted in the creation of a substantial “shadow population” <span title="887" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-887">p. 887</span>of illegal migrants—numbering in the millions—within our borders. This situation raises the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, encouraged by some to remain here as a source of cheap labor, but nevertheless denied the benefits that our society makes available to citizens and lawful residents. The existence of such an underclass presents most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law.</p>
<p id="fbfc259f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The children who are plaintiffs in these cases are special members of this underclass. Persuasive arguments support the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very presence within the United States is the product of their own unlawful conduct. These arguments do not apply with the same force to classifications imposing disabilities on the minor children of such illegal entrants. At the least, those who elect to enter our territory by stealth and in violation of our law should be prepared to bear the consequences, including, but not limited to, deportation. But the children of those illegal entrants are not comparably situated. Their “parents have the ability to conform their conduct to societal norms,” and presumably the ability to remove themselves from the State’s jurisdiction; but the children who are plaintiffs in these cases “can affect neither their parents’ conduct nor their own status.” Even if the State found it expedient to control the conduct of adults by acting against their children, legislation directing the onus of a parent’s misconduct against his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.</p>
<p id="fbfc25a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, undocumented status is not irrelevant to any proper legislative goal. Nor is undocumented status an absolutely immutable characteristic since it is the product of conscious, indeed unlawful, action. But §21.031 is directed against children, and imposes its discriminatory burden on the basis of a legal characteristic over which children can have little control. It is thus difficult to conceive of a rational justification for penalizing these children for their presence within the United States. Yet that appears to be precisely the effect of §21.031.</p>
<p id="fbfc25a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public education is not a “right” granted to individuals by the Constitution. San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez (1973). But neither is it merely some governmental “benefit” indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation. Both the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child, mark the distinction. The “American people have always regarded education and [the] acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance.”</p>
<p id="fbfc25a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have recognized “the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government,” and as the primary vehicle for transmitting “the values on which our society rests.” “[A]s . . . pointed out early in our history, . . . some degree of education is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system if we are to preserve freedom and independence.” And these historic “perceptions of the public schools as inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system have been confirmed by the observations of social scientists.” In addition, education provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all. In sum, education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society. We cannot ignore the significant social costs borne by our Nation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which our social order rests.</p>
<p id="fbfc25a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="888" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-888">p. 888</span>In addition to the pivotal role of education in sustaining our political and cultural heritage, denial of education to some isolated group of children poses an affront to one of the goals of the Equal Protection Clause: the abolition of governmental barriers presenting unreasonable obstacles to advancement on the basis of individual merit. Paradoxically, by depriving the children of any disfavored group of an education, we foreclose the means by which that group might raise the level of esteem in which it is held by the majority. But more directly, “education prepares individuals to be self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in society.” Illiteracy is an enduring disability. The inability to read and write will handicap the individual deprived of a basic education each and every day of his life. The inestimable toll of that deprivation on the social, economic, intellectual, and psychological well-being of the individual, and the obstacle it poses to individual achievement, make it most difficult to reconcile the cost or the principle of a status-based denial of basic education with the framework of equality embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="fbfc25a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These well-settled principles allow us to determine the proper level of deference to be afforded §21.031. Undocumented aliens cannot be treated as a suspect class because their presence in this country in violation of federal law is not a “constitutional irrelevancy.” Nor is education a fundamental right; a State need not justify by compelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is provided to its population. But more is involved in these cases than the abstract question whether §21.031 discriminates against a suspect class, or whether education is a fundamental right. Section 21.031 imposes a lifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status. The stigma of illiteracy will mark them for the rest of their lives. By denying these children a basic education, we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our Nation. In determining the rationality of §21.031, we may appropriately take into account its costs to the Nation and to the innocent children who are its victims. In light of these countervailing costs, the discrimination contained in §21.031 can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State.</p>

<p id="fbfc25a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the State’s principal argument, and apparently the view of the dissenting Justices, that the undocumented status of these children establishes a sufficient rational basis for denying them benefits that a State might choose to afford other residents. The State notes that while other aliens are admitted “on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws,” the asserted right of these children to an education can claim no implicit congressional imprimatur. Indeed, in the State’s view, Congress’ apparent disapproval of the presence of these children within the United States, and the evasion of the federal regulatory program that is the mark of undocumented status, provides authority for its decision to impose upon them special disabilities.</p>
<p id="fbfc25a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="889" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-889">p. 889</span>To be sure, like all persons who have entered the United States unlawfully, these children are subject to deportation. But there is no assurance that a child subject to deportation will ever be deported. An illegal entrant might be granted federal permission to continue to reside in this country, or even to become a citizen. In light of the discretionary federal power to grant relief from deportation, a State cannot realistically determine that any particular undocumented child will in fact be deported until after deportation proceedings have been completed. It would of course be most difficult for the State to justify a denial of education to a child enjoying an inchoate federal permission to remain.</p>
<p id="fbfc25a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are reluctant to impute to Congress the intention to withhold from these children, for so long as they are present in this country through no fault of their own, access to a basic education. In other contexts, undocumented status, coupled with some articulable federal policy, might enhance state authority with respect to the treatment of undocumented aliens. But in the area of special constitutional sensitivity presented by these cases, and in the absence of any contrary indication fairly discernible in the present legislative record, we perceive no national policy that supports the State in denying these children an elementary education. The State may borrow the federal classification. But to justify its use as a criterion for its own discriminatory policy, the State must demonstrate that the classification is reasonably adapted to “the purposes for which the state desires to use it.”</p>
<p id="fbfc25aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants argue that the classification at issue furthers an interest in the “preservation of the state’s limited resources for the education of its lawful residents.” Of course, a concern for the preservation of resources standing alone can hardly justify the classification used in allocating those resources. Graham v. Richardson (1971).</p>
<p id="fbfc25ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, appellants appear to suggest that the State may seek to protect itself from an influx of illegal immigrants. While a State might have an interest in mitigating the potentially harsh economic effects of sudden shifts in population, §21.031 hardly offers an effective method of dealing with an urgent demographic or economic problem. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the State’s economy. To the contrary, the available evidence suggests that illegal aliens underutilize public services, while contributing their labor to the local economy and tax money to the state fisc. The dominant incentive for illegal entry into the State of Texas is the availability of employment; few if any illegal immigrants come to this country, or presumably to the State of Texas, in order to avail themselves of a free education.</p>
<p id="fbfc25ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, while it is apparent that a State may “not . . . reduce expenditures for education by barring [some arbitrarily chosen class of] children from its schools,” appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out for exclusion because of the special burdens they impose on the State’s ability to provide high-quality public education. But the record in no way supports the claim that exclusion of undocumented children is likely to improve the overall quality of education in the State. As the District Court noted, the State failed to offer any “credible supporting evidence that a proportionately small diminution of the funds spent on each child [that might result from devoting some state funds to the education of the excluded group] will have a grave impact on the quality of education.” And, after reviewing the <span title="890" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-890">p. 890</span>State’s school financing mechanism, the District Court concluded that barring undocumented children from local schools would not necessarily improve the quality of education provided in those schools. Of course, even if improvement in the quality of education were a likely result of barring some number of children from the schools of the State, the State must support its selection of this group as the appropriate target for exclusion. In terms of educational cost and need, however, undocumented children are “basically indistinguishable” from legally resident alien children.</p>
<p id="fbfc25ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out because their unlawful presence within the United States renders them less likely than other children to remain within the boundaries of the State, and to put their education to productive social or political use within the State. Even assuming that such an interest is legitimate, it is an interest that is most difficult to quantify. The State has no assurance that any child, citizen or not, will employ the education provided by the State within the confines of the State’s borders. In any event, the record is clear that many of the undocumented children disabled by this classification will remain in this country indefinitely, and that some will become lawful residents or citizens of the United States. It is difficult to understand precisely what the State hopes to achieve by promoting the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime.</p>
<p id="fbfc25ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest. No such showing was made here.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Burger</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">O’Connor</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were it our business to set the Nation’s social policy, I would agree without hesitation that it is senseless for an enlightened society to deprive any children—including illegal aliens—of an elementary education. I fully agree that it would be folly—and wrong—to tolerate creation of a segment of society made up of illiterate persons, many having a limited or no command of our language. However, the Constitution does not constitute us as “Platonic Guardians” nor does it vest in this Court the authority to strike down laws because they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy, “wisdom,” or “common sense.” We trespass on the assigned function of the political branches under our structure of limited and separated powers when we assume a policymaking role as the Court does today.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s holding today manifests the justly criticized judicial tendency to attempt speedy and wholesale formulation of “remedies” for the failures—or simply the laggard pace—of the political processes of our system of government. The Court employs, and in my view abuses, the Fourteenth Amendment in an effort to become an omnipotent and omniscient problem solver. That the motives for doing so are noble and compassionate does not alter the fact that the Court distorts our constitutional function to make amends for the defaults of others.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispositive issue in these cases, simply put, is whether, for purpose of allocating its finite resources, a state has a legitimate reason to differentiate between persons who are lawfully within the state and those who are unlawfully there. The distinction the State of Texas has drawn—based not only upon <span title="891" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-891">p. 891</span>its own legitimate interests but on classifications established by the Federal Government in its immigration laws and policies—is not unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court acknowledges that, except in those cases when state classifications disadvantage a “suspect class” or impinge upon a “fundamental right,” the Equal Protection Clause permits a state “substantial latitude” in distinguishing between different groups of persons. Moreover, the Court expressly—and correctly—rejects any suggestion that illegal aliens are a suspect class, or that education is a fundamental right. Yet by patching together bits and pieces of what might be termed quasi-suspect-class and quasi-fundamental-rights analysis, the Court spins out a theory custom-tailored to the facts of these cases.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the end, we are told little more than that the level of scrutiny employed to strike down the Texas law applies only when illegal alien children are deprived of a public education. If ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result- oriented approach, this case is a prime example.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it is conceded—as the Court does—that illegal aliens are not a suspect class, and that education is not a fundamental right, our inquiry should focus on and be limited to whether the legislative classification at issue bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State contends primarily that §21.031 serves to prevent undue depletion of its limited revenues available for education, and to preserve the fiscal integrity of the State’s school-financing system against an ever-increasing flood of illegal aliens—aliens over whose entry or continued presence it has no control. Of course such fiscal concerns alone could not justify discrimination against a suspect class or an arbitrary and irrational denial of benefits to a particular group of persons. Yet I assume no Member of this Court would argue that prudent conservation of finite state revenues is per se an illegitimate goal. Indeed, the numerous classifications this Court has sustained in social welfare legislation were invariably related to the limited amount of revenues available to spend on any given program or set of programs.</p>
<p id="fbfc4cc7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without laboring what will undoubtedly seem obvious to many, it simply is not “irrational” for a state to conclude that it does not have the same responsibility to provide benefits for persons whose very presence in the state and this country is illegal as it does to provide for persons lawfully present. By definition, illegal aliens have no right whatever to be here, and the state may reasonably, and constitutionally, elect not to provide them with governmental services at the expense of those who are lawfully in the state.</p>

<p id="fbfc4cca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is now clearly established that intermediate scrutiny is applied in evaluating laws that discriminate against nonmarital children—that is, children whose parents were not married. In Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456 (1988), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that required a nonmarital child to establish paternity within six years of birth in order to seek support from his or her father. The Court expressly stated that intermediate scrutiny is used for discriminatory classifications based on illegitimacy. The Court felt that the six-year <span title="892" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-892">p. 892</span>limitations period was impermissible because financial needs may not emerge until later and because it did not offer the child a sufficient opportunity to present his or her own claims.</p>
<p id="fbfc4ccb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intermediate scrutiny is justified because of the unfairness of penalizing children because their parents were not married. The Supreme Court observed, “The status of illegitimacy has expressed through the ages society’s condemnation of irresponsible liaisons beyond the bonds of marriage. But visiting this condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and unjust. Moreover, imposing disabilities on the illegitimate child is contrary to the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing. Obviously, no child is responsible for his birth and penalizing the illegitimate child is ineffectual—as well as an unjust—way of deterring the parent.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12586_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12586_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">125</a></span></p>
<p id="fbfc73dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with other classifications that receive heightened scrutiny, there is a long history of discrimination and it is immutable in the sense that there is nothing the individual can do to change his or her status.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1258F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1258F_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">126</a></span> As the Supreme Court noted, “[T]he legal status of illegitimacy, however defined, is, like race or national origin, a characteristic determined by causes not within the control of the illegitimate individual, and it bears no relation to the individual’s ability to participate in and contribute to society.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1259A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1259A_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">127</a></span></p>
<p id="fbfc73e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court also has distinguished discrimination against nonmarital children from the types of classifications that receive strict scrutiny. Illegitimacy is different from race, which receives strict scrutiny, or gender, which receives intermediate scrutiny, in that “illegitimacy does not carry an obvious badge.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN125A3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N125A3_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">128</a></span> Additionally, the “discrimination against illegitimates has never approached the severity or pervasiveness of the historic legal and political discrimination against women and Negroes.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN125AB_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N125AB_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">129</a></span></p>
<p id="fbfc73e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying intermediate scrutiny in this area, two major principles emerge from the Court’s decisions. First, laws that provide a benefit to all marital children, but no nonmarital children, always are declared unconstitutional. Second, laws that provide a benefit to some nonmarital children, while denying the benefit to other nonmarital children, are evaluated on a case-by-case basis under intermediate scrutiny.</p>


<div id="fbfc73e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbfc73e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>LAWS DENYING BENEFITS TO ALL NONMARITAL CHILDREN</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fbfc73e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court consistently has invalidated laws that deny a benefit to all nonmarital children that is accorded to all marital children. In Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 68 (1968), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that prevented nonmarital children from suing under a wrongful death statute for losses because of a mother’s death. All marital children could sue but no nonmarital children. The Court found this unreasonable: “Legitimacy <span title="893" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-893">p. 893</span>or illegitimacy of birth has no relation to the nature of the wrong allegedly inflicted on the mother. . . . [I]t is invidious to discriminate against [the children] when no action, conduct or demeanor of theirs is possibly relevant to the harm that was done the mother.”</p>
<p id="fbfc73e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a companion case, Glona v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Insurance Co., 391 U.S. 73 (1968), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that prevented parents from suing for the wrongful death of their nonmarital children. The Court concluded that “[w]here the claimant is plainly the mother, the State denies equal protection of the laws to withhold relief merely because the child, wrongfully killed, was born to her out of wedlock.”</p>
<p id="fbfc73e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization v. Cahill, 411 U.S. 619 (1973), the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a state law that discriminated against non-marital children in receiving public assistance. A New Jersey law limited receipt of benefits under the “Assistance to Families of the Working Poor” program to families where there were two married adults and a child. The Supreme Court said that allowing all marital children to receive these benefits, but no nonmarital children, violated equal protection.</p>
<p id="fbfc73e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the same year that <i>Cahill</i> was decided, the Supreme Court also declared unconstitutional a Texas law that created a legal obligation for fathers to support their marital children but no similar duty with regard to nonmarital children. In Gomez v. Perez, 409 U.S. 535, 538 (1973), in concluding that the law violated equal protection, the Court stated, “[A] state may not invidiously discriminate against illegitimate children by denying them substantial benefits accorded children generally. We therefore hold that once a State posits a judicially enforceable right on behalf of children to needed support from their natural fathers there is no constitutionally sufficient justification for denying such an essential right to a child simply because its natural father has not married its mother.”</p>
<p id="fbfc73ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762 (1977), the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional a law that prevented nonmarital children from inheriting from fathers who died intestate (without a will). An Illinois law allowed marital children to inherit from either parent, but a nonmarital child only could inherit from his or her mother. Although the Court recognized the need to establish paternity for unwed fathers, it concluded that this did not justify the complete denial of benefits to all nonmarital children whose fathers died intestate.</p>
<p id="fbfc73eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all of these cases, the laws in question allowed all marital children to receive a benefit that was denied to all nonmarital children. In each instance, the Supreme Court found that the discrimination violated equal protection.</p>

<p id="fbfc9afe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No similar bright-line rule exists when the law provides a benefit to some nonmarital children that it denies to other nonmarital children. In other words, rather than discriminating between marital and nonmarital children, these laws distinguish among nonmarital children. Such statutes are subjected to intermediate scrutiny and evaluated on a case-by-case basis with the courts determining whether there is an important interest served and whether the law is substantially related to that goal.</p>
<p id="fbfc9aff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="894" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-894">p. 894</span>In Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259 (1978), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that provided that a nonmarital child could inherit from his or her father only if paternity was established during the father’s lifetime. In other words, some nonmarital children could inherit—those where paternity was established during the father’s life, other nonmarital children could not inherit—where paternity was not so established. The Court said that the state had an important interest in preventing fraud and that requiring paternity to be established during the father’s lifetime was substantially related to that objective.</p>
<p id="fbfc9b00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Labine v. Vincent, 401 U.S. 532 (1971), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that denied inheritance from a nonmarital father unless the child had been formally acknowledged by the father during the father’s life. Although the Court does not expressly say so, it appears that in <i>Labine</i>, like in <i>Lalli</i>, the Court accepted the state’s argument that requiring paternity to be established in this way is substantially related to the government’s interest in preventing fraud.</p>
<p id="fbfc9b01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another case upholding a distinction among nonmarital children was Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495 (1976). The Supreme Court sustained a provision of the Social Security Act that allowed children to receive survivors’ benefits only if they could establish both paternity and that the father was providing financial support. The law created a presumption of dependency for all marital children and all nonmarital children who were entitled to inherit under state law. The law allowed other nonmarital children to inherit only if they could prove financial dependency on their fathers. The Court found that the distinction among nonmarital children was constitutional because it did not preclude any child from receiving benefits and because it allowed the government to reduce its administrative burdens. Requiring every child to prove dependency would have been a substantial additional burden on the government; allowing all children to inherit without having to prove dependency would have been a greater cost on the government that it was not constitutionally required to absorb.</p>
<p id="fbfc9b02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, not all laws discriminating among nonmarital children have been upheld. In Jiminez v. Weinberger, 417 U.S. 628 (1974), the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of the Social Security Act that allowed intestate inheritance of disability benefits by all marital children and by nonmarital children who had been “legitimated.” Other nonmarital children could inherit benefits only if they proved that they were living with or being supported by the father at the time the disability began. In other words, nonmarital children who were neither living with the father nor being supported by him when the disability arose could not get benefits.</p>
<p id="fbfc9b03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court said that this was unconstitutional and explained, “Assuming that the appellants are in fact dependent on the claimant, it would not serve the purposes of the Act to conclusively deny them an opportunity to establish their dependency and their right to insurance benefits, and it would discriminate between the two subclasses of afterborn illegitimates without any basis for the distinction since the potential for spurious claims is exactly the same as to both subclasses.”</p>
<p id="fbfc9b04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, if the law’s distinction is between marital and nonmarital children, the law is likely to be invalidated. But if the distinction is among nonmarital children, the Court will apply intermediate scrutiny in evaluating the law.</p>

Any of these laws can be challenged as denying equal protection. Each, of course, would be subjected only to rational basis review, unless the discrimination was with regard to race, national origin, gender, alienage, or legitimacy.

Specifically, the Court has ruled that only rational basis review should be used for discrimination based on age, disability, wealth, and sexual orientation, even though these classifications share much in common with the types of discrimination for which heightened scrutiny is used.</p>

There is a history of discrimination against the elderly with judgments often based on stereotypes. A person’s age is immutable in the sense that a person cannot voluntarily change it and it is a characteristic that is visible. Yet the Supreme Court has expressly declared that only rational basis review should be used under equal protection analysis for age discrimination.</p>

<p id="fbfcc123-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question whether the provision of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., that a uniformed state police officer “shall be retired . . . upon his attaining age fifty,” denies appellee police officer equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbfcc124-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Robert Murgia was an officer in the Uniformed Branch of the Massachusetts State Police. The Massachusetts Board of Retirement retired him upon his 50th birthday. Appellee brought this civil action in the United States <span title="896" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-896">p. 896</span>District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the operation of [the law] denied him equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="fbfcc125-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary function of the Uniformed Branch of the Massachusetts State Police is to protect persons and property and maintain law and order. Specifically, uniformed officers participate in controlling prison and civil disorders, respond to emergencies and natural disasters, patrol highways in marked cruisers, investigate crime, apprehend criminal suspects, and provide backup support for local law enforcement personnel. As the District Court observed, “service in this branch is, or can be, arduous.” These considerations prompt the requirement that uniformed state officers pass a comprehensive physical examination biennially until age 40. After that, until mandatory retirement at age 50, uniformed officers must pass annually a more rigorous examination, including an electrocardiogram and tests for gastro-intestinal bleeding. Appellee Murgia had passed such an examination four months before he was retired, and there is no dispute that, when he retired, his excellent physical and mental health still rendered him capable of performing the duties of a uniformed officer.</p>
<p id="fbfcc126-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need state only briefly our reasons for [concluding] that strict scrutiny is not the proper test for determining whether the mandatory retirement provision denies appellee equal protection. San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez (1973) reaffirmed that equal protection analysis requires strict scrutiny of a legislative classification only when the classification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class. Mandatory retirement at age 50 under the Massachusetts statute involves neither situation.</p>
<p id="fbfcc127-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court’s decisions give no support to the proposition that a right of governmental employment per se is fundamental. Nor does the class of uniformed state police officers over 50 constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.</p>
<p id="fbfcc128-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination, such persons, unlike, say, those who have been discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have not experienced a “history of purposeful unequal treatment” or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities. The class subject to the compulsory retirement feature of the Massachusetts statute consists of uniformed state police officers over the age of 50. It cannot be said to discriminate only against the elderly. Rather, it draws the line at a certain age in middle life. But even old age does not define a “discrete and insular” group, United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), in need of “extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.” Instead, it marks a stage that each of us will reach if we live out our normal span. Even if the statute could be said to impose a penalty upon a class defined as the aged, it would not impose a distinction sufficiently akin to those classifications that we have found suspect to call for strict judicial scrutiny.</p>
<p id="fbfcc129-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn then to examine this state classification under the rational-basis standard. In this case, the Massachusetts statute clearly meets the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, for the State’s classification rationally furthers the purpose identified by the State: Through mandatory retirement at age 50, the legislature seeks to protect the public by assuring physical preparedness of its uniformed police. Since physical ability generally declines with age, mandatory retirement at 50 serves to remove from police service those whose fitness for uniformed work presumptively has diminished with age. This clearly is rationally <span title="897" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-897">p. 897</span>related to the State’s objective. There is no indication that §26(3)(a) has the effect of excluding from service so few officers who are in fact unqualified as to render age 50 a criterion wholly unrelated to the objective of the statute.</p>
<p id="fbfcc12a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not make light of the substantial economic and psychological effects premature and compulsory retirement can have on an individual; nor do we denigrate the ability of elderly citizens to continue to contribute to society. The problems of retirement have been well documented and are beyond serious dispute. But “[w]e do not decide today that the [Massachusetts statute] is wise, that it best fulfills the relevant social and economic objectives that [Massachusetts] might ideally espouse, or that a more just and humane system could not be revised.” We decide only that the system enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature does not deny appellee equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="fbfcc12b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbfcc12c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court holds that it is permissible for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to declare that members of its state police force who have been proved medically fit for service are nonetheless legislatively unfit to be policemen and must be involuntarily “retired” because they have reached the age of 50. Although we have called the right to work “of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [Fourteenth] Amendment to secure,” Truax v. Raich (1915), the Court finds that the right to work is not a fundamental right. And, while agreeing that “the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination,” the Court holds that the elderly are not a suspect class. Accordingly, the Court undertakes the scrutiny mandated by the bottom tier of its two-tier equal protection framework, finds the challenged legislation not to be “wholly unrelated” to its objective, and holds, therefore, that it survives equal protection attack. I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fbfcc12d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While depriving any government employee of his job is a significant deprivation, it is particularly burdensome when the person deprived is an older citizen. Once terminated, the elderly cannot readily find alternative employment. The lack of work is not only economically damaging, but emotionally and physically draining. Deprived of his status in the community and of the opportunity for meaningful activity, fearful of becoming dependent on others for his support, and lonely in his new-found isolation, the involuntarily retired person is susceptible to physical and emotional ailments as a direct consequence of his enforced idleness. Ample clinical evidence supports the conclusion that mandatory retirement poses a direct threat to the health and life expectancy of the retired person, and these consequences of termination for age are not disputed by appellants. Thus, an older person deprived of his job by the government loses not only his right to earn a living, but, too often, his health as well, in sad contradiction of Browning’s promise: “The best is yet to be, The last of life, for which the first was made.”</p>
<p id="fbfcc12e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only are the elderly denied important benefits when they are terminated on the basis of age, but the classification of older workers is itself one that merits judicial attention. Whether older workers constitute a “suspect” class or not, it cannot be disputed that they constitute a class subject to repeated and arbitrary discrimination in employment.</p>
<p id="fbfcc12f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning, then, to appellants’ arguments, I agree that the purpose of the mandatory retirement law is legitimate, and indeed compelling[;] the Commonwealth has every reason to assure that its state police officers are of sufficient physical strength and health to perform their jobs. In my view, however, <span title="898" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-898">p. 898</span>the means chosen, the forced retirement of officers at age 50, is so over-inclusive that it must fall.</p>
<p id="fbfcc130-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Commonwealth is in the position of already individually testing its police officers for physical fitness, conceding that such testing is adequate to determine the physical ability of an officer to continue on the job, and conceding that that ability may continue after age 50. In these circumstances, I see no reason at all for automatically terminating those officers who reach the age of 50; indeed, that action seems the height of irrationality.</p>

<p id="fbfcc131-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93 (1979), the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that mandated retirement at age 60 for participants in the Foreign Service Retirement System. The statutory scheme drew a distinction between those covered by the Social Security system, where there was not a mandatory retirement age, and the Foreign Service Retirement System, which required retirement at age 60. The Court used the rational basis test and said that it upheld the law because the challengers failed “to demonstrate that Congress has no reasonable basis for believing that conditions overseas generally are more demanding than conditions in the United States and that at age 60 or before many persons begin something of a decline in mental and physical reliability.” The Court said that the federal government had a legitimate interest in having a vigorous foreign service and that a mandatory retirement age was rationally related to that end.</p>

<p id="fbfcc134-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court also has ruled that only rational basis review should be used for discrimination based on disability. City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), presented in section B, is the leading case. In <i>Cleburne</i>, the Supreme Court used the rational basis test to declare unconstitutional a city ordinance that required a special permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally disabled. The Court declared that “[t]o withstand equal protection review, legislation that distinguishes between the mentally retarded and others must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.”</p>
<p id="fbfce845-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that only rational basis review is to be used for discrimination based on disability. In Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312 (1993), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that allowed mentally retarded individuals to be civilly committed if there was clear and convincing evidence justifying institutionalization but required that there be proof beyond a reasonable doubt before an individual could be committed because of mental illness. In a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court applied rational basis review and concluded that there were reasonable distinctions between the mentally retarded and the mentally ill.</p>
<p id="fbfce846-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the state’s law was constitutional because mental retardation is subject to more objective measures than mental illness. Also, the Court said that the “prevailing methods of treatment for [the] mentally retarded, as a general rule, are much less invasive than are those given the mentally ill.”</p>
<p id="fbfce847-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Blackmun dissented and argued for heightened scrutiny for laws that “discriminate against individuals with mental retardation.” Justice Souter, <span title="899" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-899">p. 899</span>joined by Justices O’Connor, Blackmun, and Stevens, contended that the law failed rational basis review.

<p id="fbfce848-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although disability classifications receive only rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN126C8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N126C8_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">131</a></span> a federal statute broadly prohibits such discrimination: the Americans with Disabilities Act.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN126D0_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N126D0_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">132</a></span></p>

<p id="fbfce84d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a time it appeared that the Court would use heightened scrutiny for laws discriminating against the poor. In Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), the Supreme Court held that it violated equal protection to deny free trial transcripts to indigent criminal defendants who were appealing their conviction. The Court said that “[i]n criminal trials a State can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or color.” Likewise, in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a poll tax for state and local elections and said that “[l]ines drawn on the basis of wealth and property, like those of race, are traditionally disfavored.”</p>
<p id="fbfce84e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court clearly held that only rational basis review should be used for wealth classifications. In Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that put a cap on welfare benefits to families regardless of their size. Children in larger families therefore received less per person than those in smaller families. The Supreme Court said that rational basis review was appropriate because the law related to “economics and social welfare.” The Court thus accepted the state’s interest in allocating scarce public benefits as sufficient to justify the law. The Court said that “the Constitution does not empower this Court to second-guess state officials charged with the difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of potential recipients.”</p>
<p id="fbfce84f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), presented in Chapter 8, the Supreme Court expressly held that poverty is not a suspect classification and that discrimination against the poor should only receive rational basis review. <i>Rodriguez</i> involved a challenge to Texas’s system of relying heavily on local property taxes to pay for public education. The result was that poor areas taxed at high rates but still had little to spend on education. Wealthy areas could tax at low rates and had a great deal to spend on schooling. The plaintiffs argued, in part, that the disparity in funding discriminated against the poor in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="fbfce850-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in a five-to-four decision, held that discrimination against the poor does not warrant heightened scrutiny. The Court also rejected the claim that the law should be regarded as discriminating against the poor as a group. Justice Powell, writing for the Court, stated, “[A] cursory examination, however, demonstrates that neither of the two distinguishing characteristics of <span title="900" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-900">p. 900</span>wealth classifications can be found here. First, in support of their charge that the system discriminates against the ‘poor,’ appellees have made no effort to demonstrate that it operates to the peculiar disadvantage of any class fairly definable as indigent. . . . [T]here is no basis on the record in this case for assuming that the poorest people—defined by reference to any level of absolute impecunity—are concentrated in the poorest districts. Second, . . . lack of personal resources has not occasioned an absolute deprivation of the desired benefit.”</p>
<p id="fbfce851-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few years later, in Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977), also presented in Chapter 8, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that the government violated equal protection when it refused to fund abortions, even though it was paying for childbirth and other medical care costs. The Court said that it “has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.”</p>
<p id="fbfce852-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the one hand, the Court’s refusal to find that poverty is a suspect classification can be justified by distinguishing that characteristic from those where heightened scrutiny is used. Poverty is not immutable, and most discrimination against the poor is a result of the effects of the law, rather than a product of intentional discrimination. Additionally, the Court clearly wanted to avoid creating a constitutional right to government benefits such as welfare, food, shelter, or medical care.</p>
<p id="fbfd0f63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the poor as a group do share many characteristics with groups that are protected by intermediate and strict scrutiny. The poor lack political power, especially in a political system where money is crucial for influence. Additionally, there is a long history of discrimination against the poor in many areas. Moreover, some prominent scholars have argued that there should be a right to minimum entitlements under the Constitution; every person should be assured of food, shelter, and medical care to survive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12701_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N12701_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">133</a></span></p>

<p id="fbfd0f67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), presented in section B, the Supreme Court used the rational basis test to invalidate a Colorado initiative that encouraged discrimination based on sexual orientation. Colorado’s Amendment 2 repealed all state and local laws that prohibited discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. The popularly approved initiative also prevented future laws to protect these individuals. The Supreme Court found that Amendment 2 impermissibly discriminated based on sexual orientation. Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, said, “Homosexuals, by state decree, are put in a solitary class with respect to transactions and relations in both the private and governmental spheres. The amendment withdraws from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal protection from the injuries caused by discrimination, and it forbids reinstatement of these laws and policies.”</p>
<p id="fbfd0f68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court said that the initiative failed even rational basis review. Justice Kennedy explained that “the amendment has the peculiar property of imposing <span title="901" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-901">p. 901</span>a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group, an exceptional and . . . invalid form of legislation.” The Court concluded that there was no legitimate purpose for denying gays, lesbians, and bisexuals the same use of the political process available to everyone else. Justice Kennedy observed that the only apparent purpose behind the law was “animosity toward the class of persons affected” and this fails even the rational basis test.</p>
<p id="fbfd0f69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Romer v. Evans is significant because it is the first time the Court invalidated discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although the Court used just rational basis review, the decision indicates judicial willingness to protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from discrimination. <i>Romer</i> establishes that animus against gays and lesbians, even when presented as a purported “moral” basis for a law, is not sufficient to meet the rational basis test. Because <i>Romer</i> found the Colorado law unconstitutional under rational basis review, the Court had no need to consider whether heightened scrutiny is appropriate for discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p id="fbfd0f6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), presented in the next chapter, the Court, relying on due process, struck down a state law prohibiting private consensual homosexual activity.

<p id="fbfd0f6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In United States v. Windsor (2013), also presented in the next chapter, the Court invalidated a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that said that for purposes of federal law and federal benefits marriage had to be between a man and a woman. The Court, in a 5-4 decision, concluded that this denied equal protection to gays and lesbians. The Court again did not indicate the level of scrutiny being applied. In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), also in the next chapter, the Court, again by a 5-4 margin, struck down state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage as violating the right to marry and denying equal protection to gays and lesbians. Yet again, the Court did not specify the level of scrutiny being used.</p>

These provisions now are codified at 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 1982. In 1871, Congress adopted the Ku Klux Klan Act, which provided criminal penalties and civil liability for any person acting under color of state law who violates the Constitution or laws of the United States or who engages in a conspiracy to violate civil rights. These provisions are now codified as 18 U.S.C. §§241 and 242 (criminal provisions), 42 U.S.C. §1983 (civil liability), and 42 U.S.C. §1985 (civil liability for conspiracies). In 1875, Congress passed a law prohibiting discrimination by places of public accommodations such as inns, theaters, and places of public amusement. This law was declared unconstitutional in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883).

The Supreme Court unanimously reversed Yick Wo’s conviction for violating the ordinance and explained, “[T]he facts shown establish an administration directed so exclusively against a particular class of persons as to warrant and require the conclusion, that, whatever may have been the intent of the ordinances as adopted, they are applied by the public authorities charged with the administration, and thus representing the State itself, with a mind so unequal and oppressive as to amount to a practical denial by the State of that equal protection of the laws.”</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fbedf4dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960), involved a challenge to the government’s redrawing of the city’s boundaries to exclude blacks from participating in city elections. Tuskegee, Alabama, was transformed from a square shape into a 28-sided figure. All but 4 or 5 of the 400 blacks in the city were placed outside its boundaries, but no whites were excluded. The Court said that the “conclusion would be irresistible, tantamount for all practical purposes to a mathematical demonstration, that the legislation is solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.” [Footnote by casebook author.]</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fbee1bf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10E35_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N10E35_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">72</a></span>&nbsp;Proof that the decision by the Village was motivated in part by a racially discriminatory purpose would not necessarily have required invalidation of the challenged decision. Such proof would, however, have shifted to the Village the burden of establishing that the same decision would have resulted even had the impermissible purpose not been considered. If this were established, the complaining party in a case of this kind no longer fairly could attribute the injury complained of to improper consideration of a discriminatory purpose. In such circumstances, there would be no justification for judicial interference with the challenged decision. But in this case respondents failed to make the required threshold showing. See Mt.

In Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 137 S.

Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Court, explained: “The unmistakable principle underlying these precedents is that discrimination on the basis of race, ‘odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.’ The jury is to be ‘a criminal defendant’s fundamental “protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice.”’ Permitting racial prejudice in the jury system damages ‘both the fact and the perception’ of the jury’s role as ‘a vital check against the wrongful exercise of power by the State.’”</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="fbee4312-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10EB5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" id="note-N10EB5_ef812baf-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">77</a></span>&nbsp;Powers v.

Because the Equal Protection Clause renders the color of one’s skin constitutionally irrelevant to the Law School’s mission, I refer to the Law School’s interest as an “aesthetic.” That is, the Law School wants to have a certain appearance, from the shape of the desks and tables in its classrooms to the color of the students sitting at them. I also use the term “aesthetic” because I believe it underlines the ineffectiveness of racially discriminatory admissions in actually helping those who are truly underprivileged. It must be remembered that the Law School’s racial discrimination does nothing for those too poor or uneducated to participate in elite higher education and therefore presents only an illusory solution to the challenges facing our Nation.

Calling such 10 or 20% plans “race-neutral” seems to me disingenuous, for they “unquestionably were adopted with the specific purpose of increasing representation of African-Americans and Hispanics in the public higher education system.” Percentage plans depend for their effectiveness on continued racial segregation at the secondary school level: They can ensure significant minority enrollment in universities only if the majority-minority high school population is large enough to guarantee that, in many schools, most of the students in the top 10 or 20% are minorities. Moreover, because such plans link college admission to a single criterion—high school class rank—they create perverse incentives. They encourage parents to keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage students from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point averages. And even if percentage plans could boost the sheer numbers of minority enrollees at the undergraduate level, they do not touch enrollment in graduate and professional schools.
