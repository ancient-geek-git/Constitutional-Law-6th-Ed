<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="fbb90255-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">
<p id="fbb90256-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter focuses on limits on state power that derive from the existence of a national government and of other states. There are two possibilities when considering whether a state or local law is invalidated because of these restrictions. One situation is where Congress has acted. If Congress has passed a law and it is a lawful exercise of congressional power, the question is whether the federal law preempts state or local law. Article VI of the Constitution provides that the “Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme Law of the Land.” Because of the Supremacy Clause, if there is a conflict between federal law and state or local law, the latter is deemed preempted.</p>
<p id="fbb90257-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other situation is where Congress has not acted—or at least the judiciary decides that federal law does not preempt state or local law. Nonetheless, even though there is not preemption, state and local laws can be challenged under two principles: the dormant Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The dormant Commerce Clause, or as it sometimes called, “the negative Commerce Clause,” is the principle that state and local laws are unconstitutional if they place an undue burden on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has inferred this limit on state regulatory power from the grant of power to Congress to regulate commerce among the states. Even if Congress has not acted, even if its commerce power lies dormant, state and local governments cannot place an undue burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fbb90258-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another basis for attacking state and local laws in the absence of preemption is the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, §2. This provision states, “The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” The Supreme Court has interpreted the Privileges and Immunities Clause as limiting the ability of states to discriminate against out-of-staters with regard to constitutional rights or important economic activities. Almost all of the recent Supreme Court cases applying the Privileges and Immunities Clause have involved challenges to state and local laws that discriminate against out-of-staters with regard to their ability to earn a livelihood.</p>
<p id="fbb90259-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A central issue throughout this chapter is the appropriate degree of judicial oversight or of judicial deference to state and local governments. At one extreme, it is possible to argue that state and local governments should be <span title="420" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-420">p. 420</span>unfettered by the federal government as much as possible. From this view, preemption should be restricted to those situations where Congress has expressly preempted state and local laws. Also from this view, there should be no dormant Commerce Clause or only a very narrow one. State and local regulation generally should be limited only if Congress clearly precludes state and local actions.</p>
<p id="fbb9025a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the other extreme, some argue that it is essential for the judiciary to preserve the federal nature of American government. From this perspective, preemption is not something to avoid; rather, preemption should be found whenever doing so will better effectuate the interests of federal law and of the federal government. Likewise, the dormant Commerce Clause is an essential restriction on abuses by state governments so as to preserve a free flow of goods and services throughout the economy.</p>
<p id="fbb9025b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the material in this chapter is very much about federalism. What is the appropriate and desirable allocation of power between the federal government and the states and also among the state governments? What is the proper role of the judiciary in reviewing state and local regulations?</p>

<p id="fbb9025e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As described above, Article VI of the Constitution contains the Supremacy Clause, which provides that the Constitution, and laws and treaties made pursuant to it, are the supreme law of the land. If there is a conflict between federal and state law, the federal law controls and the state law is invalidated because federal law is supreme. In Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 211 (1824), Chief Justice John Marshall said, “[A]cts of the State Legislatures . . . [that] interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress [are to be invalidated because][i]n every such case, the act of Congress . . . is supreme; and the law of State, though enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it.” Much more recently the Supreme Court declared, “[U]nder the Supremacy Clause, from which our pre-emption doctrine is derived, ‘any state law, however clearly within a State’s acknowledged power, which interferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.’” Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association (1992).</p>
<p id="fbb9025f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty, of course, is in deciding whether a particular state or local law is preempted by a specific federal statute or regulation. As in so many other areas of constitutional law, there is no clear rule for deciding whether a state or local law should be invalidated on preemption grounds. The Supreme Court once remarked that there is not “an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick. In the final analysis, there can be no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span></p>
<p id="fbb92871-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditionally, the Supreme Court has identified two major situations where preemption occurs. One is where a federal law expressly preempts state or local law. The other situation is where preemption is implied by a clear congressional intent to preempt state or local law.</p>
<p id="fbb92872-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="421" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-421">p. 421</span>In Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., the Court summarized the tests for preemption:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbb92873-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pre-emption may be either express or implied, and is compelled whether Congress’ command is explicitly stated in the statute’s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose. Absent explicit pre-emptive language, we have recognized at least two types of implied pre-emption: field pre-emption, where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it, and conflict pre-emption, where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbb92874-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although these categories, or minor variations, are frequently used, they are not distinct. For example, even if there is statutory language expressly preempting state law, Congress rarely is clear about the scope of what is preempted or how particular situations should be handled. Courts must decide what is preempted, and this inevitably leads to an inquiry into congressional intent. Conversely, implied preemption is often a function of both perceived congressional intent and the language used in the statute or regulation.</p>
<p id="fbb92875-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has recognized that in both express and implied preemption the issue is discerning congressional intent. The Court has said that “[t]he question whether a certain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one of congressional intent.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10069_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10069_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> It has remarked that “‘[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone’ in every preemption case.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1006F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1006F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> The problem, of course, is that Congress’s intent, especially as to the scope of preemption, is rarely expressed or clear. Therefore, although the Court purports to be finding congressional intent, it often is left to make guesses about purpose based on fragments of statutory language, random statements in the legislative history, and the degree of detail of the federal regulation.</p>
<p id="fbb92878-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the sake of clarity, this section is organized parallel to the test for preemption articulated by the Supreme Court in Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management that is quoted above and that has been frequently repeated by the Court.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1007B_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1007B_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> There are two major situations where preemption is found. First, express preemption occurs where there is explicit preemptive language. Second, there is implied preemption. The Court has identified three types of implied preemption, though the categories are not always kept distinct by the Court. One type of implied preemption is where there is a conflict between federal and state law. For example, even if federal law does not expressly preempt state law, preemption will be found where “compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10084_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10084_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span></p>
<p id="fbb94f8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, implied preemption also will be found if state law impedes the achievement of a federal objective. Even if federal and state law are not mutually exclusive and even if there is no congressional expression of a desire to <span title="422" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-422">p. 422</span>preempt state law, preemption will be found if state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1008F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1008F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span></p>
<p id="fbb94f8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final type of implied preemption is termed “field preemption”—where the scheme of federal law and regulation is “so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10098_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10098_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span></p>
<p id="fbb94f8f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For each of these types of preemption, the Court has said that the ultimate question is the intent behind the federal law or regulation. The problem is that the intent often is not expressed or is subject to many different plausible characterizations.</p>
<p id="fbb94f90-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, preemption doctrines are about allocating governing authority between the federal and state governments. A broad view of preemption leaves less room for governance by state and local governments. It is for this reason that, at times, the Court has declared that the preemption analysis “start[s] with the assumption that the historic powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100A5_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100A5_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span> But a very narrow preemption doctrine minimizes the reach of federal law and risks undermining the federal objectives.</p>
<p id="fbb94f92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic question is how willing courts should be to find preemption. Should there be a strong presumption against a court concluding that there is preemption? If so, what should be sufficient to overcome this presumption? Or should courts be willing to find preemption whenever doing so would effectuate the purposes of federal law?</p>

<p id="fbb94f95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whenever Congress has the authority to legislate, Congress can make federal law exclusive in a field. The clearest way for Congress to do this is to expressly preclude state or local regulation in an area. Thus, some federal laws contain clauses that expressly preempt state and local laws. For example, the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) states that it “supersede[s] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100BD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100BD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span> The following case is illustrative of the issues that arise when courts deal with issues of express preemption.</p>

<p id="fbb976af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1999, pursuant to his authority to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in trade, the Massachusetts Attorney General (Attorney General) promulgated regulations governing the sale and advertisement of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. The purpose of the regulations is “to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way tobacco products are marketed, sold and distributed in Massachusetts in order to address the incidence of tobacco use by children under legal age . . .

<p id="fbb99dca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the FCLAA, Congress has crafted a comprehensive federal scheme governing the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. The FCLAA’s pre-emption provision provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbb99dcb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) Additional statements</p>
<p id="fbb99dcc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by section 1333 of this title, shall be required on any cigarette package.<span title="424" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-424">p. 424</span></p>

<p id="fbb99dce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbb99dcf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FCLAA’s pre-emption provision does not cover smokeless tobacco or cigars.</p>
<p id="fbb99dd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, our task is to identify the domain expressly pre-empted, because “an express definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute . . . supports a reasonable inference . . . that Congress did not intend to pre-empt other matters.” Congressional purpose is the “ultimate touchstone” of our inquiry. Because “federal law is said to bar state action in [a] fiel[d] of traditional state regulation,” namely, advertising, we “wor[k] on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [a]re not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.” In the pre-emption provision, Congress unequivocally precludes the requirement of any additional statements on “cigarette packages beyond those provided in [the statute].” Congress further precludes States or localities from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. Without question, the second clause is more expansive than the first; it employs far more sweeping language to describe the state action that is pre-empted. We must give meaning to each element of the pre-emption provision. We are aided in our interpretation by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and the circumstances in which the current language was adopted.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1964, the groundbreaking Report of the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health concluded that “[c]igarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action.” In 1965, Congress enacted the FCLAA as a proactive measure in the face of impending regulation by federal agencies and the States. The purpose of the FCLAA was twofold: to inform the public adequately about the hazards of cigarette smoking, and to protect the national economy from interference due to diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to the relationship between smoking and health. The FCLAA prescribed a label for cigarette packages. Section 5 of the FCLAA included a pre-emption provision in which “Congress spoke precisely and narrowly.” Subsection 5(a) prohibited any requirement of additional statements on cigarette packaging. Subsection 5(b) provided that “[n]o statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.”</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1969, House and Senate committees held hearings about the health effects of cigarette smoking and advertising by the cigarette industry. The bill that emerged from the House of Representatives strengthened the warning and maintained the pre-emption provision. The Senate amended that bill, adding the ban on radio and television advertising, and changing the pre-emption language to its present form.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final result was the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, in which Congress, following the Senate’s amendments, made three significant changes to the FCLAA. First, Congress drafted a new label that read: “Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to <span title="425" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-425">p. 425</span>Your Health.” Second, Congress declared it unlawful to advertise cigarettes on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC. Finally, Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision, which proscribes any “requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion” of cigarettes. The new pre-emption provision, like its predecessor, only applied to cigarettes, and not other tobacco products.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1984, Congress again amended the FCLAA in the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. The purpose of the Act was to “provide a new strategy for making Americans more aware of any adverse health effects of smoking, to assure the timely and widespread dissemination of research findings and to enable individuals to make informed decisions about smoking.” The Act established a series of warnings to appear on a rotating basis on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising, and directed the Health and Human Services Secretary to create and implement an educational program about the health effects of cigarette smoking.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FTC has continued to report on trade practices in the cigarette industry. In 1999, the first year since the master settlement agreement, the FTC reported that the cigarette industry expended $8.24 billion on advertising and promotions, the largest expenditure ever. Substantial increases were found in point-of-sale promotions, payments made to retailers to facilitate sales, and retail offers such as buy one, get one free, or product giveaways. Substantial decreases, however, were reported for outdoor advertising and transit advertising.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The scope and meaning of the current pre-emption provision become clearer once we consider the original pre-emption language and the amendments to the FCLAA. Without question, “the plain language of the pre-emption provision in the 1969 Act is much broader.” Rather than preventing only “statements,” the amended provision reaches all “requirement[s] or prohibition[s] . . . imposed under State law.” And, although the former statute reached only statements “in the advertising,” the current provision governs “with respect to the advertising or promotion” of cigarettes. Congress expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to the States, and at the same time, it allowed the FTC to regulate cigarette advertising. Congress also prohibited cigarette advertising in electronic media altogether. Viewed in light of the context in which the current pre-emption provision was adopted, we must determine whether the FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts’ regulations governing outdoor and point-of-sale advertising of cigarettes.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbb9c4e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning first to the language in the pre-emption provision relied upon by the Court of Appeals, we reject the notion that the Attorney General’s cigarette advertising regulations are not “with respect to” advertising and promotion. The Attorney General argues that the cigarette advertising regulations are not “based on smoking and health,” because they do not involve health-related content in cigarette advertising but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising. To be sure, Members of this Court have debated the precise meaning of “based on smoking and health,” but we cannot agree with the Attorney General’s narrow construction of the phrase.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision, Congress did not concern itself solely with health warnings for cigarettes. In the 1969 amendments, Congress not only enhanced its scheme to warn the public about <span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-426">p. 426</span>the hazards of cigarette smoking, but also sought to protect the public, including youth, from being inundated with images of cigarette smoking in advertising. In pursuit of the latter goal, Congress banned electronic media advertising of cigarettes. And to the extent that Congress’s contemplated additional targeted regulation of cigarette advertising, it vested that authority in the FTC.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The context in which Congress crafted the current pre-emption provision leads us to conclude that Congress prohibited state cigarette advertising regulations motivated by concerns about smoking and health. Massachusetts has attempted to address the incidence of underage cigarette smoking by regulating advertising, much like Congress’s ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media. At bottom, the concern about youth exposure to cigarette advertising is intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health. Thus the Attorney General’s attempt to distinguish one concern from the other must be rejected.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Attorney General next claims that the State’s outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are not pre-empted because they govern the location, and not the content, of advertising. This is also Justice Stevens’ main point with respect to pre-emption.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The content versus location distinction has some surface appeal. The pre-emption provision immediately follows the section of the FCLAA that prescribes warnings. The pre-emption provision itself refers to cigarettes “labeled in conformity with” the statute. But the content/location distinction cannot be squared with the language of the pre-emption provision, which reaches all “requirements” and “prohibitions” “imposed under State law.” A distinction between the content of advertising and the location of advertising in the FCLAA also cannot be reconciled with Congress’ own location-based restriction, which bans advertising in electronic media, but not elsewhere. We are not at liberty to pick and choose which provisions in the legislative scheme we will consider, but must examine the FCLAA as a whole.</p>
<p id="fbb9c4ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Stevens maintains that Congress did not intend to displace state regulation of the location of cigarette advertising. There is a critical distinction, however, between generally applicable zoning regulations, and regulations targeting cigarette advertising. The latter type of regulation, which is inevitably motivated by concerns about smoking and health, squarely contradicts the FCLAA. The FCLAA’s comprehensive warnings, advertising restrictions, and pre-emption provision would make little sense if a State or locality could simply target and ban all cigarette advertising.</p>
<p id="fbb9ebfe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we fail to see how the FCLAA and its pre-emption provision permit a distinction between the specific concern about minors and cigarette advertising and the more general concern about smoking and health in cigarette advertising, especially in light of the fact that Congress crafted a legislative solution for those very concerns. We also conclude that a distinction between state regulation of the location as opposed to the content of cigarette advertising has no foundation in the text of the pre-emption provision. Congress pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations like the Attorney General’s because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health. Accordingly, we hold that the Attorney General’s outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations targeting cigarettes are pre-empted by the FCLAA.</p><span title="427" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-427">p. 427</span>
<p id="fbb9ebff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens,</span> with whom Justices <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter, Ginsburg,</span> and <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> join, dissenting [on the preemption issue].</p>
<p id="fbb9ec00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority acknowledges, under prevailing principles, any examination of the scope of a preemption provision must “‘start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’” Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. (1992). As the regulations at issue in this suit implicate two powers that lie at the heart of the States’ traditional police power—the power to regulate land usage and the power to protect the health and safety of minors—our precedents require that the Court construe the preemption provision “narrow[ly].” If Congress’s intent to preempt a particular category of regulation is ambiguous, such regulations are not preempted.</p>
<p id="fbb9ec01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text of the preemption provision must be viewed in context, with proper attention paid to the history, structure, and purpose of the regulatory scheme in which it appears. An assessment of the scope of a preemption provision must give effect to a “reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.”</p>
<p id="fbb9ec02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This task, properly performed, leads inexorably to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to preempt state and local regulations of the location of cigarette advertising when it adopted the provision at issue in this suit. In both 1965 and 1969, Congress made clear the purposes of its regulatory endeavor, explaining with precision the federal policies motivating its actions. According to the acts, Congress adopted a “comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,” for two reasons: (1) to inform the public that smoking may be hazardous to health and (2) to ensure that commerce and the interstate economy not be “impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.”</p>
<p id="fbb9ec03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to serve the second purpose it was necessary to preempt state regulation of the content of both cigarette labels and cigarette advertising. If one State required the inclusion of a particular warning on the package of cigarettes while another State demanded a different formulation, cigarette manufacturers would have been forced into the difficult and costly practice of producing different packaging for use in different States. To foreclose the waste of resources that would be entailed by such a patchwork regulatory system, Congress expressly precluded other regulators from requiring the placement on cigarette packaging of any “statement relating to smoking and health.” Similar concerns applied to cigarette advertising. If different regulatory bodies required that different warnings or statements be used when cigarette manufacturers advertised their products, the text and layout of a company’s ads would have had to differ from locale to locale. The resulting costs would have come with little or no health benefit. Moreover, given the nature of publishing, it might well have been the case that cigarette companies would not have been able to advertise in national publications without violating the laws of some jurisdictions. In response to these concerns, Congress adopted a parallel provision preempting state and local regulations requiring inclusion in cigarette advertising of any “statement relating to smoking and health.”</p>
<p id="fbb9ec04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was, however, no need to interfere with state or local zoning laws or other regulations prescribing limitations on the location of signs or billboards<span title="428" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-428">p. 428</span>. Laws prohibiting a cigarette company from hanging a billboard near a school in Boston in no way conflict with laws permitting the hanging of such a billboard in other jurisdictions. Nor would such laws even impose a significant administrative burden on would-be advertisers, as the great majority of localities impose general restrictions on signage, thus requiring advertisers to examine local law before posting signs whether or not cigarette-specific laws are preempted.</p>
<p id="fbb9ec05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative history of the provision also supports such a reading. The record does not contain any evidence that Congress intended to expand the scope of preemption beyond content restrictions. To the contrary, the Senate Report makes it clear that the changes merely “clarified” the scope of the original provision. Even as amended, Congress perceived the provision as “narrowly phrased” and emphasized that its purpose is to “avoid the chaos created by a multiplicity of conflicting regulations.” According to the Senate Report, the changes “in no way affect the power of any state or political subdivision of any state with respect to . . . the sale of cigarettes to minors . . . or similar police regulations.”</p>
<p id="fbb9ec06-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am firmly convinced that, when Congress amended the preemption provision in 1969, it did not intend to expand the application of the provision beyond content regulations. I, therefore, find the conclusion inescapable that the zoning regulation at issue in this suit is not a “requirement or prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising” within the meaning of the 1969 Act. Even if I were not so convinced, however, I would still dissent from the Court’s conclusion with regard to preemption, because the provision is, at the very least, ambiguous. The historical record simply does not reflect that it was Congress’s “‘clear and manifest purpose,’” to preempt attempts by States to utilize their traditional zoning authority to protect the health and welfare of minors. Absent such a manifest purpose, Massachusetts and its sister States retain their traditional police powers.</p>

<p id="fbb9ec07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another case concerning the scope of an express preemption provision was Riegel v. Medtronic, 552 U.S. 312 (2008). The Medical Devices Amendments of 1976, 21 U.S.C. §360k, preempt states from imposing “requirements” different from federal law after the Food and Drug Administration approves a medical device. The Court held, eight to one, that this preempts state tort liability against manufacturers for devices approved by the FDA. The Court reasoned that tort liability, like regulation, changes behavior and essentially creates requirements. Justice Ginsburg was alone in dissent and stressed that there should be a presumption against preemption. She said that if Congress wanted to preempt tort liability, it could do so, but that this law only preempted states from imposing “requirements.”</p>
<p id="fbb9ec08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582 (2011), the Court considered a provision of federal immigration law that expressly preempts “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ . . . unauthorized aliens.” An Arizona statute—the Legal Arizona Workers Act—provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, suspended or revoked.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101CB_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N101CB_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span></p>

Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, explained, “Because we conclude that the State’s licensing provisions fall squarely within the federal statute’s savings clause and that the Arizona regulation does not otherwise conflict with federal law, we hold that the Arizona law is not preempted. When a federal law contains an express preemption clause, we ‘focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress’ preemptive intent.’ [Federal law] expressly preempts States from imposing ‘civil or criminal sanctions’ on those who employ unauthorized aliens, ‘other than through licensing and similar laws.’ The Arizona law, on its face, purports to impose sanctions through licensing laws. The state law authorizes state courts to suspend or revoke an employer’s business licenses if that employer knowingly or intentionally employs an unauthorized alien.”</p>

<p id="fbba1320-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a federal and a state law are mutually exclusive, so that a person cannot comply with both, the state law is deemed preempted. This is called “conflicts preemption.” The difficulty often lies in determining whether the laws actually conflict. For example, if the federal government sets a standard for air pollution control, but a state sets a stricter standard, is there conflicts preemption? It depends entirely on the intent of the federal government. If the federal government made the express decision to allow pollution above that level, then a stricter state regulation is in conflict with the federal law. But if the federal government was just setting the minimum standard, the floor of regulation, then a stricter state law is not in conflict with the federal law and would not be preempted. The following case raises exactly this issue.</p>

<p id="fbba1327-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 792 of California’s Agricultural Code, which gauges the maturity of avocados by oil content, prohibits the transportation or sale in California of avocados which contain “less than 8 per cent of oil, by weight excluding the skin and seed.” In contrast, federal marketing orders approved by the Secretary of Agriculture gauge the maturity of avocados grown in Florida by standards which attribute no significance to oil content. This case presents the question of the constitutionality of the California statute insofar as it may be applied to exclude from California markets certain Florida avocados which, although certified to be mature under the federal regulations, do not uniformly meet the California requirement of 8% of oil.</p>
<p id="fbba1328-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="430" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-430">p. 430</span>We consider first appellants’ challenge under the Supremacy Clause. That the California statute and the federal marketing orders embody different maturity tests is clear. However, this difference poses, rather than disposes of the problem before us.</p>
<p id="fbba1329-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A holding of federal exclusion of state law is inescapable and requires no inquiry into congressional design where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate commerce. That would be the situation here if, for example, the federal orders forbade the picking and marketing of any avocado testing more than 7% oil, while the California test excluded from the State any avocado measuring less than 8% oil content. No such impossibility of dual compliance is presented on this record, however. As to those Florida avocados of the hybrid and Guatemalan varieties which were actually rejected by the California test, the District Court indicated that the Florida growers might have avoided such rejections by leaving the fruit on the trees beyond the earliest picking date permitted by the federal regulations, and nothing in the record contradicts that suggestion. Nor is there a lack of evidentiary support for the District Court’s finding that the Florida varieties marketed in California “attain or exceed 8% oil content while in a prime commercial marketing condition,” even though they may be “mature enough to be acceptable prior to the time that they reach that content.” Thus the present record demonstrates no inevitable collision between the two schemes of regulation, despite the dissimilarity of the standards.</p>

In other words, even if the federal and state laws are not mutually exclusive, preemption will be found if the state or local law interferes with attaining a federal legislative goal.

<p id="fbba1333-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The turning of swords into plowshares has symbolized the transformation of atomic power into a source of energy in American society. To facilitate this development the federal government relaxed its monopoly over fissionable materials and nuclear technology, and in its place, erected a complex scheme to promote the civilian development of nuclear energy, while seeking to safeguard the public and the environment from the unpredictable risks of a new technology. Early on, it was decided that the states would continue their traditional role in the regulation of electricity production. The interrelationship of federal <span title="431" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-431">p. 431</span>and state authority in the nuclear energy field has not been simple; the federal regulatory structure has been frequently amended to optimize the partnership.</p>
<p id="fbba1334-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case emerges from the intersection of the federal government’s efforts to ensure that nuclear power is safe with the exercise of the historic state authority over the generation and sale of electricity. At issue is whether provisions in the 1976 amendments to California’s Warren-Alquist Act, which condition the construction of nuclear plants on findings by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that adequate storage facilities and means of disposal are available for nuclear waste, are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbba3a46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A nuclear reactor must be periodically refueled and the “spent fuel” removed. This spent fuel is intensely radioactive and must be carefully stored. The general practice is to store the fuel in a water-filled pool at the reactor site. For many years, it was assumed that this fuel would be reprocessed; accordingly, the storage pools were designed as short-term holding facilities with limited storage capacities. As expectations for reprocessing remained unfulfilled, the spent fuel accumulated in the storage pools, creating the risk that nuclear reactors would have to be shut down. This could occur if there were insufficient room in the pool to store spent fuel and also if there were not enough space to hold the entire fuel core when certain inspections or emergencies required unloading of the reactor. In recent years, the problem has taken on special urgency. Some 8,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have already accumulated, and it is projected that by the year 2000 there will be some 72,000 metric tons of spent fuel. Government studies indicate that a number of reactors could be forced to shut down in the near future due to the inability to store spent fuel.</p>
<p id="fbba3a47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a second dimension to the problem. Even with water-pools adequate to store safely all the spent fuel produced during the working lifetime of the reactor, permanent disposal is needed because the wastes will remain radioactive for thousands of years. A number of long-term nuclear waste management strategies have been extensively examined. These range from sinking the wastes in stable deep seabeds, to placing the wastes beneath ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, to ejecting the wastes into space by rocket. The greatest attention has been focused on disposing of the wastes in subsurface geologic repositories such as salt deposits. Problems of how and where to store nuclear wastes has engendered considerable scientific, political, and public debate. There are both safety and economic aspects to the nuclear waste issue: first, if not properly stored, nuclear wastes might leak and endanger both the environment and human health; second, the lack of a long-term disposal option increases the risk that the insufficiency of interim storage space for spent fuel will lead to reactor-shutdowns, rendering nuclear energy an unpredictable and uneconomical adventure.</p>
<p id="fbba3a48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California laws at issue here are responses to these concerns. Two [provisions] are before us. Section 25524.1(b) provides that before additional nuclear plants may be built, the Energy Commission must determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be “adequate capacity” for storage of a plant’s spent fuel rods “at the time such nuclear facility requires such . . . storage.” The law also <span title="432" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-432">p. 432</span>requires that each utility provide continuous, on-site, “full core reserve storage capacity” in order to permit storage of the entire reactor core if it must be removed to permit repairs of the reactor.</p>
<p id="fbba3a49-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 25524.2 deals with the long-term solution to nuclear wastes. This section imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the Energy Commission “finds that there has been developed and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved and there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.” “Disposal” is defined as a “method for the permanent and terminal disposition of high-level nuclear waste. . . .” Such a finding must be reported to the state legislature, which may nullify it.</p>

<p id="fbba3a4b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners, the United States, and supporting amici, present three major lines of argument as to why §25524.2 is preempted. First, they submit that the statute—because it regulates construction of nuclear plants and because it is allegedly predicated on safety concerns—ignores the division between federal and state authority created by the Atomic Energy Act, and falls within the field that the federal government has preserved for its own exclusive control. Second, the statute, and the judgments that underlie it, conflict with decisions concerning the nuclear waste disposal issue made by Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Third, the California statute frustrates the federal goal of developing nuclear technology as a source of energy. We consider each of these contentions in turn.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbba3a4c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fbba3a4d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even a brief perusal of the Atomic Energy Act reveals that, despite its comprehensiveness, it does not at any point expressly require the States to construct or authorize nuclear power plants or prohibit the States from deciding, as an absolute or conditional matter, not to permit the construction of any further reactors. Instead, petitioners argue that the Act is intended to preserve the federal government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear, and that §25524.2 falls within the scope of this impliedly preempted field. But as we view the issue, Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that the federal government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost, and other related state concerns.</p>
<p id="fbba3a4e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Need for new power facilities, their economic feasibility, and rates and services, are areas that have been characteristically governed by the States. [This] is not particularly controversial. But deciding how §25524.2 is to be construed and classified is a more difficult proposition. At the outset, we emphasize that the statute does not seek to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant. It would clearly be impermissible for California to attempt to do so, for such regulation, even if enacted out of non-safety concerns, would nevertheless directly conflict with the NRC’s exclusive authority over plant construction and operation. Respondents appear to concede as much. Respondents <span title="433" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-433">p. 433</span>do broadly argue, however, that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by states is forbidden, a state may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the federal government. We reject this line of reasoning. State safety regulation is not preempted only when it conflicts with federal law. Rather, the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states. A state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field. Moreover, a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the NRC, that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal. A state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would also be in the teeth of the Atomic Energy Act’s objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use—and would be preempted for that reason.</p>
<p id="fbba3a4f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That being the case, it is necessary to determine whether there is a non-safety rationale for §25524.2. California has maintained, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that §25524.2 was aimed at economic problems, not radiation hazards. The California Assembly Committee on Resources, Land Use, and Energy, which proposed a package of bills including §25524.2, reported that the waste disposal problem was “largely economic or the result of poor planning, not safety related.” Without a permanent means of disposal, the nuclear waste problem could become critical leading to unpredictably high costs to contain the problem or, worse, shutdowns in reactors.</p>

<p id="fbba3a51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners’ second major argument concerns federal regulation aimed at the nuclear waste disposal problem itself. It is contended that §25524.2 conflicts with federal regulation of nuclear waste disposal, with the NRC’s decision that it is permissible to continue to license reactors, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the waste disposal problem, and with Congress’ recent passage of legislation directed at that problem.</p>
<p id="fbba3a52-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to its authority under the Act, the AEC, and later the NRC, promulgated extensive and detailed regulations concerning the operation of nuclear facilities and the handling of nuclear materials. The NRC’s imprimatur, however, indicates only that it is safe to proceed with such plants, not that it is economically wise to do so. Because the NRC order does not and could not compel a utility to develop a nuclear plant, compliance with both it and §25524.2 are possible. Moreover, because the NRC’s regulations are aimed at insuring that plants are safe, not necessarily that they are economical, §25524.2 does not interfere with the objective of the federal regulation.</p>

<p id="fbba3a54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, it is strongly contended that §25524.2 frustrates the Atomic Energy Act’s purpose to develop the commercial use of nuclear power. It is well established that state law is preempted if it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz (1941).</p>
<p id="fbba3a55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is little doubt that a primary purpose of the Atomic Energy Act was, and continues to be, the promotion of nuclear power. The Act itself states that it is a program “to encourage widespread participation in the development and <span title="434" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-434">p. 434</span>utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public.”</p>
<p id="fbba3a56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals is right, however, that the promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished “at all costs.” The elaborate licensing and safety provisions and the continued preservation of state regulation in traditional areas belie that. Moreover, Congress has allowed the States to determine—as a matter of economics — whether a nuclear plant vis-à-vis a fossil fuel plant should be built. The decision of California to exercise that authority does not, in itself, constitute a basis for preemption. Therefore, while the argument of petitioners and the United States has considerable force, the legal reality remains that Congress has left sufficient authority in the states to allow the development of nuclear power to be slowed or even stopped for economic reasons. Given this statutory scheme, it is for Congress to rethink the division of regulatory authority in light of its possible exercise by the states to undercut a federal objective. The courts should not assume the role which our system assigns to Congress.</p>

<p id="fbba3a57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In three recent cases, the Court considered implied preemption in the context of whether drug companies can be sued for the failure to warn patients of potential side effects, even though the Food and Drug Administration approved the warning labels. In Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009), the Court held that a drug company could be sued on a failure to warn theory even though its warning label had been approved by the FDA. The Court, in a six-to-three decision, held that there is no conflict between allowing such tort liability and federal law; drug companies always can engage in more speech to warn consumers of side effects. The Court said that allowing liability would further, not undermine, the federal regulatory goal of drug safety and well-informed patients and physicians.</p>
<p id="fbba3a58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in PLIVA v. Mensing, 564 U.S. 604 (2011), the Supreme Court held that makers of generic drugs may not be sued on a failure to warn theory. Justice Thomas, writing for the majority in a five-to-four decision, concluded that the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Food and Drug Act allow generic drugs to be sold as long as they are the equivalent of nongeneric drugs and as long as they have the same warning label as the FDA has approved for nongeneric drugs. The Court said that this precludes makers of generic drugs from changing their labels and thus preempts state tort suits for failure to warn. Justice Sotomayor wrote for the dissenters and objected that it makes no sense to allow liability for a nongeneric drug and preempt liability for the generic version of the same product. She argued that the holding in Wyeth v. Levine should apply to both generic and nongeneric drugs.</p>
<p id="fbba6169-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court followed this in Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett, 570 U.S. 472 (2013). A woman took the generic form of the pain reliever sulindac. She suffered a rare, though known side effect: two-thirds of the skin on her body burned, blistered, and decayed. She sued under state tort law claiming a design defect. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, found the claim to be preempted. The Court said that under the Hatch-Waxman Act a generic drug can be sold if it is chemically the same as a brand name drug and if it has the warning label that was approved for the brand name drug. The Court explained that the generic drug company cannot change the drug’s chemical composition <span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>and cannot change the warning label (as held in PLIVA v. Mensing) and therefore liability is preempted. Both Justices Breyer and Sotomayor wrote dissenting opinions stressing that Congress did not mean to immunize generic drug companies from liability and that once the company chooses to sell the product, it should be liable for the harms the drug imposes.</p>

<p id="fbba616c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final form of implied preemption is where federal law wholly occupies a field. Even though federal law does not expressly preempt state law, preemption will be found if there is a clear congressional intent to have federal law occupy a particular area of law. The most important example of this is immigration law.</p>
<p id="fbba616d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941), is a classic example of preemption of state regulation in the field of immigration. A Pennsylvania law required aliens to register with the state, carry a state-issued registration card, and pay a small registration fee. The Supreme Court deemed this law preempted by emphasizing that alien registration “is in a field which affects international relations, the one aspect of our government that from the first has been most generally conceded imperatively to demand broad national authority.”</p>
<p id="fbba616e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court stressed the extensive federal regulation in the area, including a “broad and comprehensive plan describing the terms and conditions upon which aliens may enter this country, how they may acquire citizenship, and the manner in which they may be deported.” Indeed, a federal law specifically required alien registration with the federal government.</p>
<p id="fbba616f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two aspects of <i>Hines</i> are particularly noteworthy. First, the Court found preemption of a state law that complemented the federal law; the state law in no way interfered with the federal law or its implementation. The Court said that states cannot “contradict or complement” federal immigration law.</p>
<p id="fbba6170-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court found field preemption in <i>Hines</i> even in the absence of express preemptive language in the federal statute. Congress certainly could have explicitly preempted state alien registration in the federal law that required aliens to register. But Congress did not do this.

<p id="fbba617a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States filed this suit against Arizona, seeking to enjoin S.B. 1070 as preempted. Four provisions of the law are at issue here. Two create new state offenses. Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor. Section 5, in relevant part, makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; this provision is referred to as §5(C). Two other provisions give specific arrest authority and investigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and local law enforcement officers. Section 6 authorizes officers to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has probable cause to believe . . . has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.” Section 2(B) provides that officers who conduct a stop, detention, or arrest must in some circumstances make efforts to verify the person’s immigration status with the Federal Government.</p>

<p id="fbba888d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens. This authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations with foreign nations.</p>
<p id="fbba888e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal power to determine immigration policy is well settled. Immigration policy can affect trade, investment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire Nation, as well as the perceptions and expectations of aliens in this country who seek the full protection of its laws. Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the United States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment of American citizens abroad.</p>
<p id="fbba888f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 separate States. This Court has reaffirmed that “[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all international relationships . . . has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country’s own nationals when those nationals are in another country.” Hines v. Davidowitz (1941).</p>
<p id="fbba8890-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal governance of immigration and alien status is extensive and complex. Congress has specified which aliens may be removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so.</p>
<p id="fbba8891-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case may turn on many factors, including whether the alien has children born in the United States, long ties <span title="437" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-437">p. 437</span>to the community, or a record of distinguished military service. Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this Nation’s international relations. Returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to these and other realities.</p>

<p id="fbba8893-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish the importance of immigration policy to the States. Arizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful immigration. Hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens are apprehended in Arizona each year. Unauthorized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one estimate, almost six percent of the population. And in the State’s most populous county, these aliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate share of serious crime.</p>
<p id="fbba8894-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizona’s concerns.

<p id="fbba8897-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3 of S.B. 1070 creates a new state misdemeanor. It forbids the “willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document . . . in violation of 8 United States Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).” In effect, §3 adds a state-law penalty for conduct proscribed by federal law. The United States contends that this state enforcement mechanism intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in which Congress has left no room for States to regulate.</p>
<p id="fbba8898-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court discussed federal alien-registration requirements in Hines v. Davidowitz. The Court found that Congress intended the federal plan for registration to be a “single integrated and all-embracing system.” Because this “complete scheme . . . for the registration of aliens” touched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to “curtail or complement” federal law or to “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.”</p>
<p id="fbba8899-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclusion here, as it did in <i>Hines,</i> that the Federal Government has occupied the field of alien registration. The federal statutory directives provide a full set of standards governing alien registration, including the punishment for noncompliance. Where Congress occupies an entire field, as it has in the field of alien registration, even complementary state regulation is impermissible. Field preemption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any state regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to federal standards.</p>
<p id="fbba889a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arizona contends that §3 can survive preemption because the provision has the same aim as federal law and adopts its substantive standards. This argument <span title="438" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-438">p. 438</span>not only ignores the basic premise of field preemption—that States may not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Government has reserved for itself— but also is unpersuasive on its own terms. Permitting the State to impose its own penalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with the careful framework Congress adopted. Were §3 to come into force, the State would have the power to bring criminal charges against individuals for violating a federal law even in circumstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.</p>
<p id="fbba889b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As it did in <i>Hines,</i> the Court now concludes that, with respect to the subject of alien registration, Congress intended to preclude States from “complement[ing] the federal law, or enforc[ing] additional or auxiliary regulations.” Section 3 is preempted by federal law.</p>

<p id="fbbaafad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike §3, which replicates federal statutory requirements, §5(C) enacts a state criminal prohibition where no federal counterpart exists. The provision makes it a state misdemeanor for “an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform work as an employee or independent contractor” in Arizona. Violations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarceration for up to six months. The United States contends that the provision upsets the balance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle to the federal plan of regulation and control.</p>
<p id="fbbaafae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress enacted IRCA as a comprehensive framework for “combating the employment of illegal aliens.” The law makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers. It also requires every employer to verify the employment authorization status of prospective employees. These requirements are enforced through criminal penalties and an escalating series of civil penalties tied to the number of times an employer has violated the provisions.</p>
<p id="fbbaafaf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This comprehensive framework does not impose federal criminal sanctions on the employee side (<i>i.e.</i>, penalties on aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work). Under federal law some civil penalties are imposed instead.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact that Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment. In the end, IRCA’s framework reflects a considered judgment that making criminals out of aliens engaged in unauthorized work—aliens who already face the possibility of employer exploitation because of their removable status—would be inconsistent with federal policy and objectives.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinary principles of preemption include the well-settled proposition that a state law is preempted where it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Under §5(C) of S.B. 1070, Arizona law would interfere with the careful balance struck by Congress with respect to unauthorized employment of aliens. Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbbaafb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>Section 6</i></p></div>
<p id="fbbaafb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 6 of S.B. 1070 provides that a state officer, “without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe . . . [the person] has <span title="439" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-439">p. 439</span>committed any public offense that makes [him] removable from the United States.” The United States argues that arrests authorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the removal system Congress created.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States. If the police stop someone based on nothing more than possible removability, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent. When an alien is suspected of being removable, a federal official issues an administrative document called a Notice to Appear. The form does not authorize an arrest. Instead, it gives the alien information about the proceedings, including the time and date of the removal hearing. If an alien fails to appear, an <i>in absentia</i> order may direct removal.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal statutory structure instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process. For example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion to issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.” And if an alien is ordered removed after a hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant. In both instances, the warrants are executed by federal officers who have received training in the enforcement of immigration law.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 6 attempts to provide state officers even greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability than Congress has given to trained federal immigration officers. Under state law, officers who believe an alien is removable by reason of some “public offense” would have the power to conduct an arrest on that basis regardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or the alien is likely to escape. This state authority could be exercised without any input from the Federal Government about whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case. This would allow the State to achieve its own immigration policy. The result could be unnecessary harassment of some aliens (for instance, a veteran, college student, or someone assisting with a criminal investigation) whom federal officials determine should not be removed.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not the system Congress created. Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer. A principal example is when the Attorney General has granted that authority to specific officers in a formal agreement with a state or local government.</p>
<p id="fbbaafb8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By authorizing state officers to decide whether an alien should be detained for being removable, §6 violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government. A decision on removability requires a determination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign national to continue living in the United States. Decisions of this nature touch on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.</p>

<p id="fbbad6ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070 requires state officers to make a “reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration status” of any person they stop, detain, or arrest on some other legitimate basis if “reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States.” The law also provides that “[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is released.” The accepted way to perform these status checks is to contact ICE, which maintains a database of immigration records.</p>
<p id="fbbad6cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="440" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-440">p. 440</span>Three limits are built into the state provision. First, a detainee is presumed not to be an alien unlawfully present in the United States if he or she provides a valid Arizona driver’s license or similar identification. Second, officers “may not consider race, color or national origin . . . except to the extent permitted by the United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s].” Third, the provisions must be “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.”</p>
<p id="fbbad6cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system. Congress has made clear that no formal agreement or special training needs to be in place for state officers to “communicate with the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration status of any individual, including reporting knowledge that a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United States.” And Congress has obligated ICE to respond to any request made by state officials for verification of a person’s citizenship or immigration status.</p>
<p id="fbbad6cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate to communicate with ICE in these situations, however. Indeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations. The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.</p>
<p id="fbbad6ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some who support the challenge to §2(B) argue that, in practice, state officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their immigration status. Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns. And it would disrupt the federal framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision. The program put in place by Congress does not allow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p id="fbbad6cf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nature and timing of this case counsel caution in evaluating the validity of §2(B). The Federal Government has brought suit against a sovereign State to challenge the provision even before the law has gone into effect. There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced. At this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume §2(B) will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law. As a result, the United States cannot prevail in its current challenge. This opinion does not foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.</p>

<p id="fbbafde6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a sovereign, Arizona has the inherent power to exclude persons from its territory, subject only to those limitations expressed in the Constitution or constitutionally imposed by Congress.</p>
<p id="fbbafde7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the predominance of federal immigration restrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the States’ traditional role in regulating immigration—and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a given that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution when (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or (2) it conflicts with federal regulation—when, for example, it admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or excludes those whom federal regulation would admit.</p>
<p id="fbbafde8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Possibility (1) need not be considered here: there is no federal law prohibiting the States’ sovereign power to exclude (assuming federal authority to enact such a law). The mere existence of federal action in the immigration area—and the so-called field preemption arising from that action, upon which the Court’s opinion so heavily relies, cannot be regarded as such a prohibition. We are not talking here about a federal law prohibiting the States from regulating bubble-gum advertising, or even the construction of nuclear plants. We are talking about a federal law going to the <i>core</i> of state sovereignty: the power to exclude. Like elimination of the States’ other inherent sovereign power, immunity from suit, elimination of the States’ sovereign power to exclude requires that “Congress . . . unequivocally expres[s] its intent to abrogate.” Implicit “field preemption” will not do.</p>
<p id="fbbafde9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor can federal power over illegal immigration be deemed exclusive because of what the Court’s opinion solicitously calls “foreign countries[‘] concern[s] about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States.” Even in its international relations, the Federal Government must live with the inconvenient fact that it is a Union of independent States, who have their own sovereign powers.</p>
<p id="fbbafdea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What this case comes down to, then, is whether the Arizona law conflicts with federal immigration law—whether it excludes those whom federal law would admit, or admits those whom federal law would exclude.

The Court therefore properly rejects the Government’s challenge, recognizing that, “[a]t this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume §2B will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.”</p>

<p id="fbbafdee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This provision of S.B. 1070 expands the statutory list of offenses for which an Arizona police officer may make an arrest without a warrant. If an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is “removable” by reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not required to make an arrest. The Government’s primary contention is that §6 is pre-empted by federal immigration law because it allows state officials to make arrests “without regard to federal priorities.”</p>
<p id="fbbafdef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course on this pre-enforcement record there is no reason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal immigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of not wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed offenses that make them removable). As Arizona points out, federal law expressly provides that state officers may “cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” and “cooperation” requires neither identical efforts nor prior federal approval. It is consistent with the Arizona statute, and with the “cooperat[ive]” system that Congress has created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien, contact federal immigration authorities, and follow their lead on what to do next. And it is an assault on logic to say that identifying a removable alien and holding him for federal determination of whether he should be removed “violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government.” The State’s detention does not represent commencement of the removal process unless the Federal Government makes it so.</p>
<p id="fbbafdf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that is not the most important point.

<p id="fbbb2502-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is beyond question that a State may make violation of federal law a violation of state law as well. We have held that to be so even when the interest protected is a distinctively federal interest, such as protection of the dignity of the national flag, or protection of the Federal Government’s ability to recruit soldiers. The Court points out, however, that in some respects the state law exceeds the punishments prescribed by federal law: It rules out probation and pardon, which are available under federal law. The answer is that it makes no difference. Illegal immigrants who violate §3 violate <i>Arizona</i> law. It is one thing to say that the Supremacy Clause prevents Arizona law from excluding those whom federal law admits. It is quite something else to say that a violation of Arizona law cannot be punished more severely than a violation of federal law. Especially where <span title="443" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-443">p. 443</span>(as here) the State is defending its own sovereign interests, there is no precedent for such a limitation. The sale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state law as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the state penalties cannot exceed the federal. As I have discussed, moreover, “field preemption” cannot establish a prohibition of additional state penalties in the area of immigration.</p>

<p id="fbbb2504-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes that §5(C) “would interfere with the careful balance struck by Congress,” (another field pre-emption notion, by the way) but that is easy to say and impossible to demonstrate. The Court relies primarily on the fact that “[p]roposals to make unauthorized work a criminal offense were debated and discussed during the long process of drafting [the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)],” “[b]ut Congress rejected them.” There is no more reason to believe that this rejection was expressive of a desire that there be no sanctions on employees, than expressive of a desire that such sanctions be left to the States. To tell the truth, it was most likely expressive of what inaction ordinarily expresses: nothing at all. It is a “naïve assumption that the failure of a bill to make it out of committee, or to be adopted when reported to the floor, is the same as a congressional rejection of what the bill contained.”</p>

Must Arizona’s ability to protect its borders yield to the reality that Congress has provided inadequate funding for federal enforcement—or, even worse, to the Executive’s unwise targeting of that funding?</p>
<p id="fbbb2507-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive’s refusal to enforce the Nation’s immigration laws?

<p id="fbbb2508-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that are the proper object of our attention suppresses the very human realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears the brunt of the country’s illegal immigration problem. Its citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy. Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so. Thousands of Arizona’s estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants—including not just children but men and women under 30—are now assured immunity from enforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Arizona citizens for employment.</p>
<p id="fbbb2509-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty—not in contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance with it.

<p id="fbbb250c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “dormant Commerce Clause” is the principle that state and local laws are unconstitutional if they place an undue burden on interstate commerce. There is no constitutional provision that expressly declares that states may not burden interstate commerce. Rather, the Supreme Court has inferred this from the grant of power to Congress in Article I, §8 to regulate commerce among the states.</p>
<p id="fbbb4c1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Congress has legislated, the issue is whether the federal law preempts the state or local law—the issue discussed above. But even if Congress has not acted or no preemption is found, the state or local law can be challenged on the ground that it excessively burdens commerce among the states. In other words, even if Congress has not acted—even if its commerce power lies dormant, state and local laws still can be challenged as unduly impeding interstate commerce. As Felix Frankfurter explained, “[T]he doctrine [is] that the Commerce Clause, by its own force and without national legislation, puts it into the power of the Court to place limits on state authority.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1049D_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1049D_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbb4c1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commerce Clause thus has two distinct functions. One is an authorization for congressional actions. The scope of Congress’s power to legislate under the Commerce Clause is discussed in Chapter 2. The other function of the Commerce Clause is in limiting state and local regulation. This is the dormant or “negative” Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fbbb4c20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dormant Commerce Clause is not the only way of challenging state laws that burden interstate commerce, especially if the state or local law discriminates against out-of-staters. For example, if the state or local government discriminates against out-of-staters with regard to a fundamental right or important economic activities, a challenge can be brought under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, §2. The Privileges and Immunities Clause is discussed in the next subsection. Also, laws that discriminate against out-of-staters can be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbbb4c21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discussion of the dormant Commerce Clause begins in subsection 1 of this section by examining whether there should be a dormant Commerce Clause. Understanding the policies underlying the dormant Commerce Clause is important in considering the cases that follow. Also, there is a debate among justices and scholars as to whether there should be a dormant Commerce Clause and under what circumstances courts should use it.</p>
<p id="fbbb4c22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection 2 then describes the history of the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause cases.</p>
<p id="fbbb4c23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection 3 presents the key cases concerning the contemporary dormant Commerce Clause. The central question in dormant Commerce Clause analysis is whether the state or local law discriminates against out-of-staters or whether it <span title="445" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-445">p. 445</span>treats in-staters and out-of-staters alike. If a law is found to discriminate, it is very likely to be declared unconstitutional. If a law is deemed nondiscriminatory, the law is likely to be upheld. Therefore, subsection 3 proceeds in three steps: First, how is it determined whether a law is discriminatory? Second, what is the analysis for laws that are discriminatory? And finally, what is the analysis for laws that are not discriminatory?</p>
<p id="fbbb4c24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection 4 then considers exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause—that is, situations in which laws that otherwise would violate the dormant Commerce Clause will be allowed. One exception is if Congress approves the state or local action. Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce among the states and may authorize laws that otherwise would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The other major exception is termed “the market participant exception.” Under the market participant exception, a state or local government may favor its own citizens in receiving benefits from state or local governments or in dealing with government-owned businesses.</p>

<p id="fbbb4c27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress always has the authority under its commerce power to preempt state or local regulation of commerce. Therefore, Congress could invalidate any state or local law that it deems to place an undue burden on interstate commerce. The crucial issue with regard to the dormant Commerce Clause is whether the judiciary, in the absence of congressional action, should invalidate state and local laws because they place an undue burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fbbb7338-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525 (1949), Justice Jackson, writing for the Court, explains the justifications for the dormant Commerce Clause:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbbb7339-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This distinction between the power of the State to shelter its people from menaces to their health or safety and from fraud, even when those dangers emanate from interstate commerce, and its lack of power to retard, burden or constrict the flow of such commerce for their economic advantage, is one deeply rooted in both our history and our law.</p>

<p id="fbbb733a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When victory relieved the Colonies from the pressure for solidarity that war had exerted, a drift toward anarchy and commercial warfare between states began. “[E]ach state would legislate according to its estimate of its own interests, the importance of its own products, and the local advantages or disadvantages of its position in a political or commercial view.” This came “to threaten at once the peace and safety of the Union.” Story, The Constitution. The sole purpose for which Virginia initiated the movement which ultimately produced the Constitution was “to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the relative situations and trade of the said states; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulation may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony” and for that purpose the General Assembly of Virginia in January of 1786 named commissioners and proposed their meeting with those from other states. The desire of the Forefathers to federalize regulation of foreign and interstate commerce stands in sharp contrast to their jealous preservation of power over their internal affairs. No other federal power was so universally assumed to be necessary, no other state power was so readily relinquished.</p>
<p id="fbbb733b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The necessity of centralized regulation of commerce among the states was so obvious and so fully recognized that the few words of the Commerce Clause were <span title="446" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-446">p. 446</span>little illuminated by debate.

<p id="fbbb733c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The material success that has come to inhabitants of the states which make up this federal free trade unit has been the most impressive in the history of commerce, but the established interdependence of the states only emphasizes the necessity of protecting interstate movement of goods against local burdens and repressions. We need only consider the consequences if each of the few states that produce copper, lead, high-grade iron ore, timber, cotton, oil or gas should decree that industries located in that state shall have priority. What fantastic rivalries and dislocations and reprisals would ensue if such practices were begun! Or suppose that the field of discrimination and retaliation be industry. May Michigan provide that automobiles cannot be taken out of that State until local dealers’ demands are fully met? Would she not have every argument in the favor of such a statute that can be offered in support of New York’s limiting sales of milk for out-of-state shipment to protect the economic interests of her competing dealers and local consumers? Could Ohio then pounce upon the rubber-tire industry, on which she has a substantial grip, to retaliate for Michigan’s auto monopoly?</p>
<p id="fbbb733d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free access to every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will withhold his export, and no foreign state will by customs duties or regulations exclude them. Likewise, every consumer may look to the free competition from every producing area in the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any.

<p id="fbbb7345-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Tennessee imposes demanding durational-residency requirements on all individuals and businesses seeking to obtain or renew a license to operate a liquor store. One provision precludes the renewal of a license unless the applicant has resided in the State for 10 consecutive years. Another provides that a corporation cannot obtain a license unless all of its stockholders are residents. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down these provisions as blatant violations of the Commerce Clause, and neither petitioner—an association of Tennessee liquor retailers—nor the State itself defends them in this Court.</p>
<p id="fbbb7346-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Sixth Circuit also invalidated a provision requiring applicants for an initial license to have resided in the State for the prior two years, and petitioner does challenge that decision. But while this requirement is less extreme than the others that the Sixth Circuit found to be unconstitutional, we now hold that it also violates the Commerce Clause and is not shielded by §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment. Section 2 was adopted as part of the scheme that ended prohibition on the national level. It gives each State leeway in choosing the alcohol-related public health and safety measures that its citizens find desirable. But §2 is not a license to impose all manner of protectionist restrictions on commerce in alcoholic beverages. Because Tennessee’s 2-year residency requirement for retail license applicants blatantly favors the State’s residents and has little relationship to public health and safety, it is unconstitutional.</p><span title="447" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-447">p. 447</span>

<p id="fbbb9a5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals held that Tennessee’s 2-year residency requirement violates the Commerce Clause, which provides that “[t]he Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3. “Although the Clause is framed as a positive grant of power to Congress,” we have long held that this Clause also prohibits state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce. “This ‘negative’ aspect of the Commerce Clause” prevents the States from adopting protectionist measures and thus preserves a national market for goods and services.</p>
<p id="fbbb9a5c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This interpretation, generally known as “the dormant Commerce Clause,” has a long and complicated history. Its roots go back as far as Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), where Chief Justice Marshall found that a version of the dormant Commerce Clause argument had “great force.”</p>
<p id="fbbb9a5d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years, some Members of the Court have authored vigorous and thoughtful critiques of this interpretation. But the proposition that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state protectionism is deeply rooted in our case law. And without the dormant Commerce Clause, we would be left with a constitutional scheme that those who framed and ratified the Constitution would surely find surprising.</p>
<p id="fbbb9a5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is so because removing state trade barriers was a principal reason for the adoption of the Constitution. Under the Articles of Confederation, States notoriously obstructed the interstate shipment of goods. “Interference with the arteries of commerce was cutting off the very life-blood of the nation.” The Annapolis Convention of 1786 was convened to address this critical problem, and it culminated in a call for the Philadelphia Convention that framed the Constitution in the summer of 1787. At that Convention, discussion of the power to regulate interstate commerce was almost uniformly linked to the removal of state trade barriers, and when the Constitution was sent to the state conventions, fostering free trade among the States was prominently cited as a reason for ratification. In The Federalist No. 7, Hamilton argued that state protectionism could lead to conflict among the States, and in No. 11, he touted the benefits of a free national market. In The Federalist No. 42, Madison sounded a similar theme.</p>
<p id="fbbb9a5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this background, it would be strange if the Constitution contained no provision curbing state protectionism, and at this point in the Court’s history, no provision other than the Commerce Clause could easily do the job. The only other provisions that the Framers might have thought would fill that role, <span title="448" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-448">p. 448</span>at least in part, are the Import-Export Clause, Art. I, §10, cl. 2, which generally prohibits a State from “lay[ing] any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports,” and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, §2, which provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” But the Import-Export Clause was long ago held to refer only to international trade. And the Privileges and Immunities Clause has been interpreted not to protect corporations, and may not guard against certain discrimination scrutinized under the dormant Commerce Clause. So if we accept the Court’s established interpretation of those provisions, that leaves the Commerce Clause as the primary safeguard against state protectionism.</p>
<p id="fbbb9a60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not surprising, then, that our cases have long emphasized the connection between the trade barriers that prompted the call for a new Constitution and our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. [W]e observed that our dormant Commerce Clause cases reflect a “‘central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.’” In light of this history and our established case law, we reiterate that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state protectionism.</p>

Instead, their arguments are based on §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, to which we will now turn.</p>

This would mean, among other things, that a state law prohibiting the importation of alcohol for sale to persons of a particular race, religion, or sex would be immunized from challenge under the Equal Protection Clause. Similarly, if a state law prohibited the importation of alcohol for sale by proprietors who had expressed an unpopular point of view on an important public issue, the First Amendment would provide no protection. If a State imposed a duty on the importation of foreign wine or spirits, the Import-Export Clause would have to give way. If a state law retroactively made it a crime to have bought or sold imported alcohol under specified conditions, the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause would provide no barrier to conviction.

Instead, we have held that §2 must be viewed as one part of a unified constitutional scheme. In attempting to understand how §2 and other constitutional provisions work together, we have looked to history for guidance, and history has taught us that the thrust of §2 is to “constitutionaliz[e]” the basic structure of federal-state alcohol regulatory authority that prevailed prior to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbbbc179-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By 1933, support for Prohibition had substantially diminished but not vanished completely. Thirty-eight state conventions eventually ratified the Twenty-first Amendment, but 10 States either rejected or took no action on the Amendment. Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and thus ended nationwide Prohibition, but §2, the provision at issue here, gave each State the option of banning alcohol if its citizens so chose. Accordingly, we have inferred that §2 was meant to “constitutionaliz[e]” the basic understanding of the extent of the States’ power to regulate alcohol that prevailed before Prohibition.</p>
<p id="fbbbc17a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This understanding is supported by the debates on the Amendment in Congress and the state ratifying conventions. The records of the state conventions provide no evidence that §2 was understood to give States the power to enact protectionist laws, “a privilege [the States] had not enjoyed at any earlier time.”</p>
<p id="fbbbc17b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying that principle, we have invalidated state alcohol laws aimed at giving a competitive advantage to in-state businesses. Most recently, in Granholm [v. Heald (2005)], we struck down a set of discriminatory direct-shipment laws that favored in-state wineries over out-of-state competitors. After surveying the history of §2, we affirmed that “the Twenty-first Amendment does not immunize all laws from Commerce Clause challenge.” We therefore examined whether the challenged laws were reasonably necessary to protect the States’ asserted interests in policing underage drinking and facilitating tax collection. Concluding that the answer to that question was no, we invalidated the laws as inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause’s nondiscrimination principle.</p>
<p id="fbbbc17c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To summarize, the Court has acknowledged that §2 grants States latitude with respect to the regulation of alcohol, but the Court has repeatedly declined to read §2 as allowing the States to violate the “nondiscrimination principle” that was a central feature of the regulatory regime that the provision was meant to constitutionalize.</p>

<p id="fbbbc17e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that §2 does not confer limitless authority to regulate the alcohol trade, we now apply the §2 analysis dictated by the provision’s history and our precedents.</p>
<p id="fbbbc17f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we viewed Tennessee’s durational-residency requirements as a package, it would be hard to avoid the conclusion that their overall purpose and effect is protectionist. Indeed, two of those requirements—the 10-year residency requirement for license renewal and the provision that shuts out all publicly traded corporations—are so plainly based on unalloyed protectionism that neither the Association nor the State is willing to come to their defense. The provision that the Association and the State seek to preserve—the 2-year residency requirement for initial license applicants—forms part of that scheme. But we assume that it can be severed from its companion provisions, and we therefore analyze that provision on its own.</p>
<p id="fbbbc180-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the 2-year residency requirement discriminates on its face against nonresidents, it could not be sustained if it applied across the board to all those seeking to operate any retail business in the State. But because of §2, we engage in a different inquiry. Recognizing that §2 was adopted to give each State the authority to address alcohol-related public health and safety issues in accordance with the preferences of its citizens, we ask whether the challenged requirement can be justified as a public health or safety measure or on some other legitimate nonprotectionist ground. Section 2 gives the States regulatory authority that they would not otherwise enjoy, but “mere speculation” or “unsupported assertions” are insufficient to sustain a law that would otherwise violate the Commerce Clause. Where the predominant effect of a law is protectionism, not the protection of public health or safety, it is not shielded by §2.</p>
<p id="fbbbc181-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provision at issue here expressly discriminates against nonresidents and has at best a highly attenuated relationship to public health or safety. [T]he record is devoid of any “concrete evidence” showing that the 2-year residency requirement actually promotes public health or safety; nor is there evidence that nondiscriminatory alternatives would be insufficient to further those interests.</p>
<p id="fbbbc182-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given all this, the Association has fallen far short of showing that the 2-year durational-residency requirement for license applicants is valid. Like the other discriminatory residency requirements that the Association is unwilling to defend, the predominant effect of the 2-year residency requirement is simply to protect the Association’s members from out-of-state competition. We therefore hold that this provision violates the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbbbc184-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alcohol occupies a complicated place in this country’s history. Some of the founders were enthusiasts; Benjamin Franklin thought wine was “proof that God loves us.” Many in the Prohibition era were decidedly less enamored; they saw “liquor [a]s a lawlessness unto itself.” Over time, the people have adopted two separate constitutional Amendments to adjust and then readjust alcohol’s role in our society. But through it all, one thing has always held true: States may impose residency requirements on those who seek to sell alcohol within their borders to ensure that retailers comply with local laws and norms. In fact, States have enacted residency requirements for at least 150 years, and the Tennessee <span title="451" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-451">p. 451</span>law at issue before us has stood since 1939. Today and for the first time, the Court claims to have discovered a duty and power to strike down laws like these as unconstitutional. Respectfully, I do not see it.</p>
<p id="fbbbe795-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with the text of the Constitution. After the Nation’s failed experiment with Prohibition, the people assembled in conventions in each State to adopt the Twenty-first Amendment. In §1, they repealed the Eighteenth Amendment’s nationwide prohibition on the sale of alcohol. But in §2, they provided that “[t]he transportation or importation into any State . . . for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.” The Amendment thus embodied a classically federal compromise: Nationwide prohibition ended, but States gained broad discretion to calibrate alcohol regulations to local preferences. And under the terms of this compromise, Tennessee’s law imposing a two-year residency requirement on those who seek to sell liquor within its jurisdiction would seem perfectly permissible.</p>
<p id="fbbbe796-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, §2 does not immunize state laws from <i>all</i> constitutional claims. Everyone agrees that state laws must still comply with, say, the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause. But the challenge before us isn’t based on any constitutional provision like that. Instead, we are asked to decide whether Tennessee’s residency requirement impermissibly discriminates against out-of-state residents and recent arrivals in violation of the “dormant Commerce Clause” doctrine. And that doctrine is a peculiar one. Unlike most constitutional rights, the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine cannot be found in the text of any constitutional provision but is (at best) an implication from one. Under its banner, this Court has sometimes asserted the power to strike down state laws that discriminate against nonresidents on the ground that they usurp the authority to regulate interstate commerce that the Constitution assigns in Article I to Congress. But precisely because the Constitution assigns <i>Congress</i> the power to regulate interstate commerce, that body is free to rebut any implication of unconstitutionality that might otherwise arise under the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by authorizing States to adopt laws favoring in-state residents.</p>
<p id="fbbbe797-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And that’s exactly what happened here. In the Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913, Congress gave the States wide latitude to restrict the sale of alcohol within their borders. Not only is that law still on the books today, §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment closely “followed the wording of the 1913 Webb-Kenyon Act.” Accordingly, the people who adopted the Amendment naturally would have understood it to constitutionalize an “exception to the normal operation of the [dormant] Commerce Clause.” After all, what Congress can do by statute “surely the people may do . . . through the process of amending our Constitution.” So in this area, at least, we should not be in the business of imposing our own judge-made “dormant Commerce Clause” limitations on state powers.</p>
<p id="fbbbe798-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the relevant constitutional and statutory texts suggest, history confirms. Licensing requirements for the sale of liquor are older than the Nation itself.</p>
<p id="fbbbe799-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As judges, we may be sorely tempted to “rationalize” the law and impose our own free-trade rules for all goods and services in interstate commerce. Certainly, that temptation seems to have proven nearly irresistible for this Court when it comes to alcohol. But real life is not always so tidy and satisfactory, and neither are the democratic compromises we are bound to respect as judges. Like it or not, those who adopted the Twenty-first Amendment took the view that reasonable people can disagree about the costs and benefits of free trade in alcohol. They left us with clear instructions that the free-trade rules this Court <span title="452" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-452">p. 452</span>has devised for “cabbages and candlesticks” should not be applied to alcohol. Under the terms of the compromise they hammered out, the regulation of alcohol wasn’t left to the imagination of a committee of nine sitting in Washington, D. C., but to the judgment of the people themselves and their local elected representatives. State governments were supposed to serve as “laborator[ies]” of democracy, with “broad power to regulate liquor under §2.” If the people wish to alter this arrangement, that is their sovereign right. But until then, I would enforce the Twenty-first Amendment as they wrote and originally understood it.</p>

<p id="fbbbe79a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court presents the traditional arguments for having a dormant Commerce Clause. First, there is a historical argument for the dormant Commerce Clause: The framers intended to prevent state laws that interfered with interstate commerce. Second, there is an economic justification for the dormant Commerce Cause: The economy is better off if state and local laws impeding interstate commerce are invalidated. Third, there is a political justification for the dormant Commerce Clause: States and their citizens should not be harmed by laws in other states where they lack political representation. In McCulloch v. Maryland, the Supreme Court invalidated Maryland’s tax on the Bank of the United States, in part, because it was a tax that ultimately would be borne by those in other states that obviously did not have representation in the Maryland political process.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105DD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105DD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span> Similarly, the political process cannot be trusted when a state is helping itself at the expense of out-of-staters who have no representation. Justice Stone explained: “Underlying the stated rule has been the thought, often expressed in judicial opinion, that when the regulation is of such a character that its burden falls principally upon those without the state, legislative action is not likely to be subjected to those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely some interests within the state.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105E3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105E3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbbe79d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But others, as Justice Alito alluded to, argue against the existence of a dormant Commerce Clause. The strongest recent criticism of the existence of the dormant Commerce Clause has been by Justice Clarence Thomas. For example, in a dissenting opinion in Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564 (1997). The majority of the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional on dormant Commerce Clause grounds a state property tax because its exemption for property owned by charitable institutions excluded organizations operated principally for the benefit of nonresidents.</p>
<p id="fbbbe79e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Thomas dissented and strongly criticized the dormant Commerce Clause, especially in instances where the state does not discriminate against out-of-staters. Thomas wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbbbe79f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application. In one fashion or another, every Member of the current Court and a goodly number of our predecessors have at least recognized these problems, if not been troubled by them.</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To cover its exercise of judicial power in an area for which there is no textual basis, the Court has historically offered two different theories in support of its <span title="453" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-453">p. 453</span>negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The first theory posited was that the Commerce Clause itself constituted an exclusive grant of power to Congress. See, e.g., Passenger Cases (1849). The “exclusivity” rationale was likely wrong from the outset, however. And, in any event, the Court has long since “repudiated” the notion that the Commerce Clause operates as an exclusive grant of power to Congress, and thereby forecloses state action respecting interstate commerce. Freeman v. Hewit (1946) (Rutledge, J., concurring). Indeed, the Court’s early view that the Commerce Clause, on its own, prohibited state impediments to interstate commerce such that “Congress cannot re-grant, or in any manner reconvey to the states that power,” Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots (185[1]), quickly proved untenable. And, as this Court’s definition of the scope of congressional authority under the positive Commerce Clause has expanded, the exclusivity rationale has moved from untenable to absurd.</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second theory offered to justify creation of a negative Commerce Clause is that Congress, by its silence, pre-empts state legislation. See Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist. (1887) (asserting that congressional silence evidences congressional intent that there be no state regulation of commerce). In other words, we presumed that congressional “inaction” was “equivalent to a declaration that inter-State commerce shall be free and untrammelled.” Welton v. Missouri (1876). To the extent that the “pre-emption-by-silence” rationale ever made sense, it, too, has long since been rejected by this Court in virtually every analogous area of the law.</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even were we wrongly to assume that congressional silence evidenced a desire to pre-empt some undefined category of state laws, and an intent to delegate such policy-laden categorization to the courts, treating unenacted congressional intent as if it were law would be constitutionally dubious.</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, neither of the Court’s proffered theoretical justifications—exclusivity or pre-emption-by-silence—currently supports our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, if either ever did. Despite the collapse of its theoretical foundation, I suspect we have nonetheless adhered to the negative Commerce Clause because we believed it necessary to check state measures contrary to the perceived spirit, if not the actual letter, of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has taken us well beyond the invalidation of obviously discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce. We have used the Clause to make policy-laden judgments that we are ill equipped and arguably unauthorized to make. Any test that requires us to assess (1) whether a particular statute serves a “legitimate” local public interest; (2) whether the effects of the statute on interstate commerce are merely “incidental” or “clearly excessive in relation to the putative benefits”; (3) the “nature” of the local interest; and (4) whether there are alternative means of furthering the local interest that have a “lesser impact” on interstate commerce, and even then makes the question “one of degree,” surely invites us, if not compels us, to function more as legislators than as judges. Moreover, our open-ended balancing tests in this area have allowed us to reach different results based merely “on differing assessments of the force of competing analogies.”</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, none of this policy-laden decisionmaking is proper. Rather, the Court should confine itself to interpreting the text of the Constitution, which itself seems to prohibit in plain terms certain of the more egregious state taxes on interstate commerce described above, and leaves to Congress the policy choices necessary for any further regulation of interstate commerce.</p>
</div>

<p id="fbbc0eb6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument against the dormant Commerce Clause is, in part, textual. The drafters of the Constitution could have included a provision prohibiting <span title="454" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-454">p. 454</span>states from interfering with interstate commerce. Also, opponents of the dormant Commerce Clause argue that the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce and Congress can act to invalidate state laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. The argument is that this should not be a task for an unelected federal judiciary. Thus, this is an argument based partially on separation of powers (the task of reviewing state laws should be done by Congress and not by the courts) and partially on federalism (minimizing the instances where state and local laws are invalidated).</p>
<p id="fbbc0eb7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reading the cases that follow, consider these competing policy considerations, whether there should be a dormant Commerce Clause, and especially when it should apply.</p>

<p id="fbbc0eba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dormant Commerce Clause can be traced back to Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824). The issue in <i>Gibbons</i> was whether the state of New York could grant an exclusive monopoly for operating steamboats in New York waters and thereby prevent a person with a federal license from operating in New York. As presented in Chapter 2, Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the Court, used <i>Gibbons</i> as the occasion for broadly defining the scope of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. Marshall said that “commerce” refers to all stages of business and that “among the states” includes matters that affect more than one state and are not purely internal. Chief Justice John Marshall also used <i>Gibbons</i> for considering the Commerce Clause as an independent limit on state power, even where Congress has not acted. Marshall explained that “when a State proceeds to regulate commerce with foreign nations, or among the several states, it is exercising the very power that is granted to Congress, and is doing the very thing which Congress is authorized to do.” This argument would seem to imply that Congress’s commerce power is exclusive; that any state regulation of commerce is inconsistent with federal power. The idea appears to be that the power to regulate commerce is the authority to decide that commerce should not be regulated and that states therefore should not be able to act with regard to commerce unless specifically authorized by Congress.</p>
<p id="fbbc0ebb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Marshall, however, did not go nearly this far in limiting state authority. Rather, Marshall drew a distinction between a state’s exercise of its police power and a state exercising the federal power over commerce. Marshall said, for example, that state inspection laws are constitutional even though they may have a “considerable influence on commerce” because they are a “portion of that great immense of legislation, which embraces every thing within the territory of a State, not surrendered to the general government; all which can be most advantageously exercised by the States themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a State, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, etc., are component parts of this mass.”</p>
<p id="fbbc0ebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has struggled ever since <i>Gibbons</i> with attempting to articulate criteria for when state laws burdening commerce should be upheld as valid exercises of the police power and when they should be invalidated as violating the dormant Commerce Clause.

<p id="fbbc35d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases applied the <i>Cooley</i> test throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. In Welton v. Missouri, 91 U.S. (1 Otto) 275 (1875), the Court used the <i>Cooley</i> approach to invalidate a law that required peddlers of out-of-state merchandise to pay a tax and obtain a license, whereas no similar requirements existed for in-state merchants. The Court said that “transportation and exchange of commodities is of national importance, and admits and requires uniformity of regulation.” Similarly, in Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886), the Court used the <i>Cooley</i> approach to invalidate a state law that regulated railway rates for goods brought to or from other states. The Court emphasized that there would be enormous burdens on interstate commerce if all states adopted such laws and thus concluded that it was an area that required national uniformity and not local regulation.</p>
<p id="fbbc35d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But during this same time the Court upheld other state laws on the ground that they were in areas where diverse regulation was desirable. For instance, in Smith v. Alabama, 124 U.S. 465 (1888), the Court upheld a state law requiring that all locomotive engineers operating in the state be licensed by a state board of examiners. Likewise, in Erb v. Morasch, 177 U.S. 584 (1900), the Court upheld a city’s ordinance that restricted train speed within the city. In Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commn., 283 U.S. 380 (1931), the Court upheld a state law that required electric headlights of prescribed brightness on all trains operating within the state.</p>
<p id="fbbc35da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nineteenth century’s approaches summarized above—the police power/commerce power test of <i>Gibbons</i> and the local/national subject matter test of <i>Cooley</i> — attempted to draw rigid categories of areas where federal law was exclusive and those where states could regulate. The modern approach is based not on rigid categories, but rather on courts balancing the benefits of a law against the burdens that it imposes on interstate commerce. It should be noted, however, that the Court never has expressly overruled any of the earlier tests and sometimes invokes them in explaining a particular result.</p>
<p id="fbbc5ceb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s shift to a balancing approach in dormant commerce clause analysis is evident from comparing two cases, South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., 330 U.S. 177 (1938) and Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945). In <i>Barnwell</i>, the Court upheld a state law that imposed length and width requirements for trucks operating in the state. The Court emphasized the state’s important interest in protecting highway safety and in preserving its roadways. In contrast, in <i>Southern Pacific</i>, the Court declared unconstitutional a state law that limited the length of railroad trains operating in the state. The Court in <i>Southern Pacific</i> expressly articulated a balancing test when it said: “Hence the matters for ultimate determination here are the nature and extent of the burden which the state regulation of interstate trains, adopted as a safety measure, imposes on interstate commerce, and whether the relative weights of the state and nation(al interests involved are such [as to make the law permissible].” The difference is that in <i>Barnwell</i>, the Court believed that the burdens on interstate commerce were outweighed by the benefits in terms of road safety; whereas in <i>Southern Pacific</i>, the Court decided that the burdens on interstate transportation were greater than the safety benefit to the state from its law.</p>
<p id="fbbc5cec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="457" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-457">p. 457</span>In other words, the central issue in dormant commerce clause cases is whether the benefits of the state law outweigh its burdens on interstate commerce. By definition, such a balancing test gives courts enormous discretion because it is attempting to weigh and compare two completely different things: burdens on interstate commerce and the benefits to a state or local government.</p>
<p id="fbbc5ced-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years, some justices, most notably Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas, have objected to this balancing test and have argued in favor of upholding all state laws that are deemed nondiscriminatory. Justice Scalia contended, “This process is ordinarily called ‘balancing,’ but the scale analogy is not really appropriate, since the interests on both sides are incommensurate. It is more like judging whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy. . . . Weighing the governmental interests of a State against the needs of interstate commerce is, by contrast, a task squarely within the responsibility of Congress, and ill suited to the judicial function.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106AD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106AD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> As quoted above, Justice Thomas also has been very critical of the balancing test in dormant Commerce Clause cases, and of the existence of the dormant commerce clause more generally.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106B3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106B3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbc5cf0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question, of course, is what should replace the balancing test. The categorical approaches that preceded it were not useful in deciding whether a particular law violated the dormant Commerce Clause. Justice Scalia’s answer is to eliminate dormant Commerce Clause review where the state is not discriminating against out-of-staters. Scalia wrote, “I would therefore abandon the balancing approach to these negative Commerce Clause cases . . . and leave essentially legislative judgments to the Congress. . . . In my view, a state statute is invalid under the Commerce Clause if, and only if, it accords discriminatory treatment to interstate commerce in a respect not required to achieve a lawful state purpose.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106BC_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106BC_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbc5cf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question that Justices Scalia and Thomas raise is whether there should be any dormant Commerce Clause review when a state law is deemed nondiscriminatory.</p>
<p id="fbbc5cf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the one hand, assuring a free flow of commerce among the states is best achieved by eliminating burdens on interstate commerce. On the other hand, there is no reason to distrust the political process when it is treating in-staters and out-of-staters alike. Limiting the scope of the dormant Commerce Clause has the benefits of minimizing the judicial role and maximizing the deference paid to state and local governments.</p>

<p id="fbbc8408-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The balancing prescribed by the Supreme Court is not the same in all dormant Commerce Clause cases, but instead varies depending upon whether the state or local law discriminates against out-of-staters or treats in-staters and out-of-staters alike. As discussed below, if the Court concludes that a state is discriminating <span title="458" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-458">p. 458</span>against out-of-staters, then there is a strong presumption against the law and it will be upheld only if it is necessary to achieve an important purpose. In contrast, if the Court concludes that the law is nondiscriminatory, then the presumption is in favor of upholding the law, and it will be invalidated only if it is shown that the law’s burdens on interstate commerce outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p id="fbbc8409-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the threshold question is determining whether the state law is discriminatory against out-of-staters. This makes sense in light of the purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. The framers were most concerned about stopping protectionist state legislation, where a state would discriminate against out-of-staters to benefit its citizens at the expense of out-of-staters. Also, it is thought that protectionist laws are most likely to interfere with the economy. Besides, if a law applies to in-staters and out-of-staters equally, then at least some of those affected by the law are represented in the political process.</p>
<p id="fbbc840a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes laws are facially discriminatory against out-of-staters; that is, the laws in their very terms draw a distinction between in-staters and out-of-staters. Other times, laws are facially neutral, but might be motivated by a desire to help in-staters at the expense of out-of-staters or might have a discriminatory impact against those from other states. The first set of cases presented below involves facial discrimination; then presented are cases involving claims of facially neutral laws with discriminatory purpose or impact. After these cases, the next subsection looks at the analysis used when a law is deemed discriminatory; following this is a subsection examining the analysis for when a law is deemed not discriminatory.</p>

<p id="fbbc840d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes, a law clearly favors in-staters over out-of-staters. For example, in Granholm v.

In recent years, many of the cases before the Supreme Court involving the dormant Commerce Clause have involved challenges to state and local environmental regulations. Below are three important Supreme Court decisions considering local laws designed to deal with solid-waste disposal problems.</p>

<p id="fbbcab26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutory provision in question is ch. 363 of 1973 N.J. Laws, which took effect in early 1974. In pertinent part it provides: “No person shall bring into this State <span title="459" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-459">p. 459</span>any solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the State, except garbage to be fed to swine in the State of New Jersey, until the commissioner [of the State Department of Environmental Protection] shall determine that such action can be permitted without endangering the public health, safety and welfare and has promulgated regulations permitting and regulating the treatment and disposal of such waste in this State.”</p>
<p id="fbbcab27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Immediately affected by these developments were the operators of private landfills in New Jersey, and several cities in other States that had agreements with these operators for waste disposal.

<p id="fbbcab28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection; none is excluded by definition at the outset. Hence, we reject the state court’s suggestion that the banning of “valueless” out-of-state wastes by ch. 363 implicates no constitutional protection. Just as Congress has power to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are not free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement.</p>

<p id="fbbcab2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the States, many subjects of potential federal regulation under that power inevitably escape congressional attention “because of their local character and their number and diversity.” South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., Inc. (1939). In the absence of federal legislation, these subjects are open to control by the States so long as they act within the restraints imposed by the Commerce Clause itself.</p>
<p id="fbbcab2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinions of the Court through the years have reflected an alertness to the evils of “economic isolation” and protectionism, while at the same time recognizing that incidental burdens on interstate commerce may be unavoidable when a State legislates to safeguard the health and safety of its people. Thus, where simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtually per se rule of invalidity has been erected. The clearest example of such legislation is a law that overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at a State’s borders.</p>
<p id="fbbcab2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crucial inquiry, therefore, must be directed to determining whether ch. 363 is basically a protectionist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental.</p>
<p id="fbbcab2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of ch. 363 is set out in the statute itself as follows: “The Legislature finds and determines that . . . the volume of solid and liquid waste continues to rapidly increase, that the treatment and disposal of these wastes continues to pose an even greater threat to the quality of the environment of New Jersey, that the available and appropriate land fill sites within the State are being diminished, that the environment continues to be threatened by the treatment and disposal of waste which originated or was collected outside the State, and that the public health, safety and welfare require that the treatment and disposal within this State of all wastes generated outside of the State be prohibited.”</p>
<p id="fbbcab2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t does not matter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reduce the waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or to save remaining open lands <span title="460" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-460">p. 460</span>from pollution, for we assume New Jersey has every right to protect its residents’ pocketbooks as well as their environment. And it may be assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue those ends by slowing the flow of all waste into the State’s remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce may incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey’s ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently. Both on its face and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of nondiscrimination.</p>
<p id="fbbcd23f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whether the ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steady supply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinous outside competition, or to create jobs by keeping industry within the State, or to preserve the State’s financial resources from depletion by fencing out indigent immigrants. In each of these cases, a presumably legitimate goal was sought to be achieved by the illegitimate means of isolating the State from the national economy.</p>
<p id="fbbcd240-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New Jersey law at issue in this case falls squarely within the area that the Commerce Clause puts off limits to state regulation. On its face, it imposes on out-of-state commercial interests the full burden of conserving the State’s remaining landfill space. The New Jersey law blocks the importation of waste in an obvious effort to saddle those outside the State with the entire burden of slowing the flow of refuse into New Jersey’s remaining landfill sites. That legislative effort is clearly impermissible under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Today, cities in Pennsylvania and New York find it expedient or necessary to send their waste into New Jersey for disposal, and New Jersey claims the right to close its borders to such traffic. Tomorrow, cities in New Jersey may find it expedient or necessary to send their waste into Pennsylvania or New York for disposal, and those States might then claim the right to close their borders. The Commerce Clause will protect New Jersey in the future, just as it protects her neighbors now, from efforts by one State to isolate itself in the stream of interstate commerce from a problem shared by all.</p>

<p id="fbbcd242-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A growing problem in our Nation is the sanitary treatment and disposal of solid waste. For many years, solid waste was incinerated. Because of the significant environmental problems attendant on incineration, however, this method of solid waste disposal has declined in use in many localities, including New Jersey. “Sanitary” landfills have replaced incineration as the principal method of disposing of solid waste. In ch. 363 of the 1973 N.J. Laws, the State of New Jersey legislatively recognized the unfortunate fact that landfills also present extremely serious health and safety problems. First, in New Jersey, “virtually all sanitary landfills can be expected to produce leachate, a noxious and highly polluted liquid which is seldom visible and frequently pollutes . . . ground and surface waters.” The natural decomposition process which occurs in landfills also produces large quantities of methane and thereby presents a significant explosion hazard. Landfills can also generate “health hazards caused by rodents, fires and scavenger birds” and, “needless to say, do not help New Jersey’s aesthetic appearance nor New Jersey’s noise or water or air pollution problems.”</p>
<p id="fbbcd243-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The health and safety hazards associated with landfills present appellees with a currently unsolvable dilemma. Other, hopefully safer, methods of disposing <span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-461">p. 461</span>of solid wastes are still in the development stage and cannot presently be used. But appellees obviously cannot completely stop the tide of solid waste that its citizens will produce in the interim. For the moment, therefore, appellees must continue to use sanitary landfills to dispose of New Jersey’s own solid waste despite the critical environmental problems thereby created.</p>
<p id="fbbcd244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented in this case is whether New Jersey must also continue to receive and dispose of solid waste from neighboring States, even though these will inexorably increase the health problems discussed above. The Court answers this question in the affirmative. New Jersey must either prohibit all landfill operations, leaving itself to cast about for a presently nonexistent solution to the serious problem of disposing of the waste generated within its own borders, or it must accept waste from every portion of the United States, thereby multiplying the health and safety problems which would result if it dealt only with such wastes generated within the State. Because past precedents establish that the Commerce Clause does not present appellees with such a Hobson’s choice, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbbcd245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases involving facially discriminatory laws have dealt with attempts by state and local governments to conserve their natural resources for use by their own residents. The following case is illustrative of such a state law that facially discriminates in this way.</p>
<p id="fbbcd246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has held that reciprocity requirements—a state allows out-of-staters to have access to markets or resources only when the out-of-staters are from states that grant similar benefits—are facially discriminatory. For instance, in Great A&amp;P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366 (1976), the Court unanimously invalidated a Mississippi law that provided that milk could be shipped into Mississippi from another state only if it had a public health certificate and only if the other state would accept milk from Mississippi on a reciprocal basis. Likewise, in Sporhase v. Nebraska, 458 U.S. 941 (1982), the Court found that a state law was discriminatory when it denied a permit to draw and use water for use in another state unless that state granted reciprocal rights to draw water for use in Nebraska.</p>

The Court has declared: “A court may find that a state law constitutes ‘economic protectionism’ on proof either of discriminatory effect or of discriminatory purpose.” Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 450 U.S. 1027 (1981). This is very different from analysis under the Equal Protection Clause, discussed in Chapter 7, where a facially neutral law is deemed discriminatory only if there is both a discriminatory purpose and a discriminatory effect.</p>
<p id="fbbcf95a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty for courts is in deciding whether a particular law has a discriminatory purpose or a legitimate nondiscriminatory objective and whether a law should be deemed to have a discriminatory impact.

In the first case presented, Hunt v. <span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-462">p. 462</span>Washington State Apple Advertising Commn., the Court found that discriminatory impact is sufficient for a law to be deemed discriminatory and concluded that the state’s statute was impermissibly discriminatory in its effects. In the second case, Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, the Court found that the law was not discriminatory and upheld its constitutionality. As you read these cases, compare their discriminatory effects and consider whether there is a meaningful difference in this regard between the decisions.</p>

<p id="fbbcf960-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Burger</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbbcf961-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Washington State is the Nation’s largest producer of apples, its crops accounting for approximately 30% of all apples grown domestically and nearly half of all apples shipped in closed containers in interstate commerce. As might be expected, the production and sale of apples on this scale is a multimillion dollar enterprise which plays a significant role in Washington’s economy. Because of the importance of the apple industry to the State, its legislature has undertaken to protect and enhance the reputation of Washington apples by establishing a stringent, mandatory inspection program, administered by the State’s Department of Agriculture, which requires all apples shipped in interstate commerce to be tested under strict quality standards and graded accordingly. In all cases, the Washington State grades, which have gained substantial acceptance in the trade, are the equivalent of, or superior to, the comparable grades and standards adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Compliance with the Washington inspection scheme costs the State’s growers approximately $1 million each year.</p>
<p id="fbbcf962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1973, North Carolina enacted a statute which required all closed containers of apples sold, offered for sale, or shipped into the State to bear “no grade other than the applicable U.S. grade or standard.” State grades were expressly prohibited. In addition to its obvious consequence prohibiting the display of Washington State apple grades on containers of apples shipped into North Carolina, the regulation presented the Washington apple industry with a marketing problem of potentially nationwide significance. Washington apple growers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 of which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State variety and grade. It is the industry’s practice to purchase these containers preprinted with the various apple varieties and grades, prior to harvest. After these containers are filled with apples of the appropriate type and grade, a substantial portion of them are placed in cold-storage warehouses where the grade labels identify the product and facilitate its handling. These apples are then shipped as needed throughout the year; after February 1 of each year, they constitute approximately two-thirds of all apples sold in fresh markets in this country. Since the ultimate destination of these apples is unknown at the time they are placed in storage, compliance with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required Washington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving their product a damaged appearance. Alternatively, they could have <span title="463" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-463">p. 463</span>changed their marketing practices to accommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina in containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for that market in such special containers. As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted containers entirely. None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry. Moreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to display the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive inspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd years of its existence.</p>
<p id="fbbcf963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening interstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes various forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing business in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of their North Carolina counterparts unaffected. As previously noted, this disparate effect results from the fact that North Carolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing practices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA grade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs imposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington apple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance from the North Carolina market.</p>
<p id="fbbcf964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The record demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the apple trade.</p>
<p id="fbbcf965-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, the statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. As noted earlier, the Washington State grades are equal or superior to the USDA grades in all corresponding categories. Hence, with free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage vis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior. However, because of the statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the superior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts. Such “downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-of-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an embargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them from the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that such apples would otherwise command.</p>
<p id="fbbd2076-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When discrimination against commerce of the type we have found is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake. Dean Milk Co. v. Madison (1951). North Carolina has failed to sustain that burden on both scores. <span title="464" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-464">p. 464</span>The several States unquestionably possess a substantial interest in protecting their citizens from confusion and deception in the marketing of foodstuffs, but the challenged statute does remarkably little to further that laudable goal at least with respect to Washington apples and grades. The statute, as already noted, permits the marketing of closed containers of apples under no grades at all. Such a result can hardly be thought to eliminate the problems of deception and confusion created by the multiplicity of differing state grades; indeed, it magnifies them by depriving purchasers of all information concerning the quality of the contents of closed apple containers. Moreover, although the statute is ostensibly a consumer protection measure, it directs its primary efforts, not at the consuming public at large, but at apple wholesalers and brokers who are the principal purchasers of closed containers of apples. And those individuals are presumably the most knowledgeable individuals in this area. Since the statute does nothing at all to purify the flow of information at the retail level, it does little to protect consumers against the problems it was designed to eliminate.</p>
<p id="fbbd2077-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, it appears that nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades are readily available. For example, North Carolina could effectuate its goal by permitting out-of-state growers to utilize state grades only if they also marked their shipments with the applicable USDA label. In that case, the USDA grade would serve as a benchmark against which the consumer could evaluate the quality of the various state grades.</p>

<p id="fbbd207d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbbd207e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A Maryland statute provides that a producer or refiner of petroleum products (1) may not operate any retail service station within the State, and (2) must extend all “voluntary allowances” uniformly to all service stations it supplies.</p>
<p id="fbbd207f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Maryland statute is an outgrowth of the 1973 shortage of petroleum. In response to complaints about inequitable distribution of gasoline among retail stations, the Governor of Maryland directed the State Comptroller to conduct a market survey. The results of that survey indicated that gasoline stations operated by producers or refiners had received preferential treatment during the period of short supply. The Comptroller therefore proposed legislation which was “designed to correct the inequities in the distribution and pricing of gasoline reflected by the survey.”</p>
<p id="fbbd2080-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential facts alleged in the complaint are not in dispute. All of the gasoline sold by Exxon in Maryland is transported into the State from refineries located elsewhere. Although Exxon sells the bulk of this gas to wholesalers and independent retailers, it also sells directly to the consuming public through 36 company-operated stations. Exxon uses these stations to test innovative marketing concepts or products. Focusing primarily on the Act’s requirement that it discontinue its operation of these 36 retail stations, Exxon’s complaint challenged the validity of the statute.</p>
<p id="fbbd2081-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plainly, the Maryland statute does not discriminate against interstate goods, nor does it favor local producers and refiners. Since Maryland’s entire gasoline supply flows in interstate commerce and since there are no local producers or <span title="465" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-465">p. 465</span>refiners, such claims of disparate treatment between interstate and local commerce would be meritless. Appellants, however, focus on the retail market arguing that the effect of the statute is to protect in-state independent dealers from out-of-state competition. They contend that the divestiture provisions “create a protected enclave for Maryland independent dealers. . . .” As support for this proposition, they rely on the fact that the burden of the divestiture requirements falls solely on interstate companies. But this fact does not lead, either logically or as a practical matter, to a conclusion that the State is discriminating against interstate commerce at the retail level.</p>
<p id="fbbd2082-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the record shows, there are several major interstate marketers of petroleum that own and operate their own retail gasoline stations. These interstate dealers, who compete directly with the Maryland independent dealers, are not affected by the Act because they do not refine or produce gasoline. In fact, the Act creates no barriers whatsoever against interstate independent dealers; it does not prohibit the flow of interstate goods, place added costs upon them, or distinguish between in-state and out-of-state companies in the retail market. The absence of any of these factors fully distinguishes this case from those in which a State has been found to have discriminated against interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commn. For instance, the Court in <i>Hunt</i> noted that the challenged state statute raised the cost of doing business for out-of-state dealers, and, in various other ways, favored the in-state dealer in the local market. No comparable claim can be made here. While the refiners will no longer enjoy their same status in the Maryland market, in-state independent dealers will have no competitive advantage over out-of-state dealers. The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fbbd2083-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants argue, however, that this fact does show that the Maryland statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce. They point to evidence in the record which indicates that, because of the divestiture requirements, at least three refiners will stop selling in Maryland, and which also supports their claim that the elimination of company-operated stations will deprive the consumer of certain special services. Even if we assume the truth of both assertions, neither warrants a finding that the statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce. Some refiners may choose to withdraw entirely from the Maryland market, but there is no reason to assume that their share of the entire supply will not be promptly replaced by other interstate refiners. The source of the consumers’ supply may switch from company-operated stations to independent dealers, but interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.</p>
<p id="fbbd2084-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants claim that the statute “will surely change the market structure by weakening the independent refiners. . . .” We cannot, however, accept appellants’ underlying notion that the Commerce Clause protects the particular structure or methods of operation in a retail market. [T]he Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations. It may be true that the consuming public will be injured by the loss of the high-volume, low-priced stations operated by the independent refiners, but again that argument relates to the wisdom of the statute, not to its burden <i>on</i> commerce.</p><span title="466" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-466">p. 466</span>
<p id="fbbd4795-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Blackmun,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbbd4796-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent from the Court’s opinion because it fails to condemn impermissible discrimination against interstate commerce in <i>retail</i> gasoline marketing. The divestiture provisions preclude out-of-state competitors from retailing gasoline within Maryland. The effect is to protect in-state retail service station dealers from the competition of the out-of-state businesses. This protectionist discrimination is not justified by any legitimate state interest that cannot be vindicated by more even-handed regulation. [The law,] therefore, violate[s] the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fbbd4797-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Maryland the retail marketing of gasoline is interstate commerce, for all petroleum products come from outside the State. Retailers serve interstate travelers. To the extent that particular retailers succeed or fail in their businesses, the interstate wholesale market for petroleum products is affected.</p>
<p id="fbbd4798-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commerce Clause forbids discrimination against interstate commerce, which repeatedly has been held to mean that States and localities may not discriminate against the transactions of out-of-state actors in interstate markets. The discrimination need not appear on the face of the state or local regulation. “The Commerce Clause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. In each case it is our duty to determine whether the statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in its practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce.” The state or local authority need not intend to discriminate in order to offend the policy of maintaining a free-flowing national economy. As demonstrated in <i>Hunt</i>, a statute that on its face restricts both intrastate and interstate transactions may violate the Clause by having the “practical effect” of discriminating in its operation. If discrimination results from a statute, the burden falls upon the state or local government to demonstrate legitimate local benefits justifying the inequality and to show that less discriminatory alternatives cannot protect the local interests.</p>
<p id="fbbd4799-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this background, the unconstitutional discrimination in the Maryland statute becomes apparent. No facial inequality exists; §§(b) and (c) preclude all refiners and producers from marketing gasoline at the retail level. But given the structure of the retail gasoline market in Maryland, the effect of §§(b) and (c) is to exclude a class of predominantly out-of-state gasoline retailers while providing protection from competition to a class of nonintegrated retailers that is overwhelmingly composed of local businessmen.</p>
<p id="fbbd479a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1974, of the 3,780 gasoline service stations in the State, 3,547 were operated by nonintegrated local retail dealers. Of the 233 company-operated stations, 197 belonged to out-of-state integrated producers or refiners. Thirty-four were operated by nonintegrated companies that would not have been affected immediately by the Maryland statute. The only in-state integrated petroleum firm, Crown Central Petroleum, Inc., operated just two service stations. Of the class of stations statutorily insulated from the competition of the out-of-state integrated firms, then, more than 99% were operated by local business interests. Of the class of enterprises excluded entirely from participation in the retail gasoline market, 95% were out-of-state firms, operating 98% of the stations in the class.</p>
<p id="fbbd479b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discrimination suffered by the out-of-state integrated producers and refiners is significant. Five of the excluded enterprises, Ashland Oil, Inc., BP Oil, Inc., Kayo Oil Co., Petroleum Marketing Corp., and Southern States Cooperative, Inc., market nonbranded gasoline through price competition <span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-467">p. 467</span>rather than through brand recognition. Of the 98 stations marketing gasoline in this manner, all but 6 are company operated. The record also contains testimony that the discrimination will burden the operations of major branded companies, such as appellants Exxon, Phillips, Shell, and Gulf, all of which are out-of-state firms. Most importantly, §§(b) and (c) will preclude these companies, as well as those mentioned in the previous paragraph, from competing directly for the profits of retail marketing.</p>
<p id="fbbd479c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he State appears to be concerned about unfair competitive behavior such as predatory pricing or inequitable allocation of petroleum products by the integrated firms. These are the only examples of specific misconduct asserted in the State’s answers. But none of the concerns support the discrimination in §§(b) and (c). There is no proof in the record that any significant portion of the class of out-of-state firms burdened by the divestiture sections has engaged in such misconduct. Furthermore, predatory pricing and unfair allocation already have been prohibited by both state and federal law. Less discriminatory legislation, which would regulate the leasing of all service stations, not just those owned by the out-of-state integrated producers and refiners, could prevent whatever evils arise from short-term leases.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fbbd479d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also found discrimination based on the disparate impact of a facially neutral law in C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994). A city adopted an ordinance that required all nonhazardous solid waste in the town to be deposited at a transfer station. The law allowed recyclers to continue to receive solid waste, but they had to bring their nonrecyclables to the transfer station. In other words, the companies could not ship nonrecyclable waste itself and they had to pay a fee at the transfer station even if it had already sorted the waste.</p>
<p id="fbbd479e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinance was facially neutral and applied to both in-state and out-of-state companies. Nonetheless, the Court deemed the law discriminatory because of its effect on out-of-staters: “While the immediate effect of the ordinance is to direct local transport of solid waste to a designated site within the local jurisdiction, its economic effects are interstate in reach. . . . [T]he flow control ordinance discriminates, for it allows only the favored operator to process waste that is within the limits of the town. The ordinance is no less discriminatory because in-state or in-town processors are also covered by the prohibition.”</p>
<p id="fbbd479f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, in United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S. 330 (2007), the Court found constitutional an ordinance very similar to that which it struck down in <i>C&amp;A Carbone.</i> In <i>C&amp;A Carbone</i>, the city had a “flow control ordinance” for trash that required haulers to bring it to a private facility, whereas in <i>United Haulers</i>, the ordinance required that the trash be brought to a state-created public benefit corporation.</p>
<p id="fbbd47a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court found that this distinction was crucial. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Court, explained, “We find this difference constitutionally significant. Disposing of trash has been a traditional government activity for years, and laws that favor the government in such areas — but treat every private business, whether in-state or out-of-state, exactly the same—do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the Commerce Clause. Applying the Commerce Clause test reserved for regulations that do not discriminate against <span title="468" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-468">p. 468</span>interstate commerce, we uphold these ordinances because any incidental burden they may have on interstate commerce does not outweigh the benefits they confer on the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties.”</p>
<p id="fbbd47a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the dissent by Justice Alito, joined by Justices Stevens and Kennedy, saw this as a distinction without a difference. It was still the government discriminating in favor of in-state businesses at the expense of out-of-state businesses by requiring that trash be brought to the in-state facility. For this dissent, this discrimination was enough to trigger strict scrutiny and invalidate the ordinance.</p>
<p id="fbbd47a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Facially neutral laws also can be found to be discriminatory if they were enacted for a protectionist purpose: helping in-staters at the expense of out-of-staters. Although the following two cases involve discussion of both purpose and effect, in the former, West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, the Court invalidated a state law largely because of its discriminatory purpose, but in the latter case, Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., the Court upheld the law by finding that the law did not have a discriminatory objective.</p>

<p id="fbbd6ebb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the 1980s and early 1990s, Massachusetts dairy farmers began to lose market share to lower cost producers in neighboring States. In response, the Governor of Massachusetts appointed a Special Commission to study the dairy industry. The commission found that many producers had sold their dairy farms during the past decade and that if prices paid to farmers for their milk were not significantly increased, a majority of the remaining farmers in Massachusetts would be “forced out of business within the year.”</p>
<p id="fbbd6ebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 28, 1992, relying on the commission’s report, the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture (respondent) declared a State of Emergency. [T]he Massachusetts order requires dealers to make payments into a fund that is disbursed to farmers on a monthly basis. The assessments, however, are only on Class I sales and the distributions are only to Massachusetts farmers.</p>
<p id="fbbd6ebd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commerce Clause also limits the power of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to adopt regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce. “This ‘negative’ aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibits economic protectionism—that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state <span title="469" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-469">p. 469</span>economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors. . . . Thus, state statutes that clearly discriminate against interstate commerce are routinely struck down . . . unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism. . . .” New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach (1988).</p>
<p id="fbbd6ebe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent’s principal argument is that, because “the milk order achieves its goals through lawful means,” the order as a whole is constitutional. He argues that the payments to Massachusetts dairy farmers from the Dairy Equalization Fund are valid, because subsidies are constitutional exercises of state power, and that the order premium which provides money for the fund is valid, because it is a nondiscriminatory tax. Therefore the pricing order is constitutional, because it is merely the combination of two independently lawful regulations. In effect, respondent argues, if the State may impose a valid tax on dealers, it is free to use the proceeds of the tax as it chooses; and if it may independently subsidize its farmers, it is free to finance the subsidy by means of any legitimate tax.</p>
<p id="fbbd6ebf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even granting respondent’s assertion that both components of the pricing order would be constitutional standing alone, the pricing order nevertheless must fall. A pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business. The pricing order in this case, however, is funded principally from taxes on the sale of milk produced in other States. By so funding the subsidy, respondent not only assists local farmers, but burdens interstate commerce. The pricing order thus violates the cardinal principle that a State may not “benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.”</p>
<p id="fbbd6ec0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More fundamentally, respondent errs in assuming that the constitutionality of the pricing order follows logically from the constitutionality of its component parts. By conjoining a tax and a subsidy, Massachusetts has created a program more dangerous to interstate commerce than either part alone. Nondiscriminatory measures, like the evenhanded tax at issue here, are generally upheld, in spite of any adverse effects on interstate commerce, in part because “[t]he existence of major in-state interests adversely affected . . . is a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse.” Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co. (1981). However, when a nondiscriminatory tax is coupled with a subsidy to one of the groups hurt by the tax, a State’s political processes can no longer be relied upon to prevent legislative abuse, because one of the in-state interests which would otherwise lobby against the tax has been mollified by the subsidy. So, in this case, one would ordinarily have expected at least three groups to lobby against the order premium, which, as a tax, raises the price (and hence lowers demand) for milk: dairy farmers, milk dealers, and consumers. But because the tax was coupled with a subsidy, one of the most powerful of these groups, Massachusetts dairy farmers, instead of exerting their influence against the tax, were in fact its primary supporters.</p>
<p id="fbbd6ec1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More fundamentally, respondent ignores the fact that Massachusetts dairy farmers are part of an integrated interstate market. [T]he purpose and effect of the pricing order are to divert market share to Massachusetts dairy farmers. This diversion necessarily injures the dairy farmers in neighboring States. Preservation of local industry by protecting it from the rigors of interstate competition is the hallmark of the economic protectionism that the Commerce Clause prohibits.</p>

<p id="fbbd95d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbbd95d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1977, the Minnesota Legislature enacted a statute banning the retail sale of milk in plastic nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers, but permitting such sale in other nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers, such as paperboard milk cartons. The purpose of the Minnesota statute is set out as §1: “The legislature finds that the use of nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers for the packaging of milk and other milk products presents a solid waste management problem for the state, promotes energy waste, and depletes natural resources. The legislature therefore determines that the use of nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers for packaging milk and other milk products should be discouraged and that the use of returnable and reusable packaging for these products is preferred and should be encouraged.” Proponents of the legislation argued that it would promote resource conservation, ease solid waste disposal problems, and conserve energy. Relying on the results of studies and other information, they stressed the need to stop introduction of the plastic nonreturnable container before it became entrenched in the market.</p>
<p id="fbbd95d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Act was passed, respondents filed suit in Minnesota District Court, seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The court further found that, contrary to the statement of purpose in §1, the “actual basis” for the Act “was to promote the economic interests of certain segments of the local dairy and pulpwood industries at the expense of the economic interests of other segments of the dairy industry and the plastics industry.” The court therefore declared the Act “null, void, and unenforceable.”</p>
<p id="fbbd95da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When legislating in areas of legitimate local concern, such as environmental protection and resource conservation, States are nonetheless limited by the Commerce Clause. If a state law purporting to promote environmental purposes is in reality “simple economic protectionism,” we have applied a “virtually per se rule of invalidity.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey (1978). Even if a statute regulates “even-handedly,” and imposes only “incidental” burdens on interstate commerce, the courts must nevertheless strike it down if “the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. (1970). Moreover, “the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.”</p>
<p id="fbbd95db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may find that a state law constitutes “economic protectionism” on proof either of discriminatory effect or of discriminatory purpose. Respondents advance a “discriminatory purpose” argument, relying on a finding by the District Court that the Act’s “actual basis was to promote the economic interests of certain segments of the local dairy and pulpwood industries at the expense of the economic interests of other segments of the dairy industry and the plastics industry.”</p>
<p id="fbbd95dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Minnesota’s statute does not effect “simple protectionism,” but “regulates even-handedly” by prohibiting all milk retailers from selling their products in plastic, nonreturnable milk containers, without regard to whether the milk, the containers, or the sellers are from outside the State. This statute is therefore unlike statutes discriminating against interstate commerce, which we have consistently struck down. E.g., Hughes v. Oklahoma (1979); Philadelphia v. New <span title="471" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-471">p. 471</span>Jersey [(1978)]; Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n [(1977)]. Since the statute does not discriminate between interstate and intrastate commerce, the controlling question is whether the incidental burden imposed on interstate commerce by the Minnesota Act is “clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.” We conclude that it is not.</p>
<p id="fbbd95dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The burden imposed on interstate commerce by the statute is relatively minor. Milk products may continue to move freely across the Minnesota border, and since most dairies package their products in more than one type of container, the inconvenience of having to conform to different packaging requirements in Minnesota and the surrounding States should be slight. Within Minnesota, business will presumably shift from manufacturers of plastic nonreturnable containers to producers of paperboard cartons, refillable bottles, and plastic pouches, but there is no reason to suspect that the gainers will be Minnesota firms, or the losers out-of-state firms. Indeed, two of the three dairies, the sole milk retailer, and the sole milk container producer challenging the statute in this litigation are Minnesota firms.</p>
<p id="fbbd95de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pulpwood producers are the only Minnesota industry likely to benefit significantly from the Act at the expense of out-of-state firms. Respondents point out that plastic resin, the raw material used for making plastic nonreturnable milk jugs, is produced entirely by non-Minnesota firms, while pulpwood, used for making paperboard, is a major Minnesota product. Nevertheless, it is clear that respondents exaggerate the degree of burden on out-of-state interests, both because plastics will continue to be used in the production of plastic pouches, plastic returnable bottles, and paperboard itself, and because out-of-state pulpwood producers will presumably absorb some of the business generated by the Act. Even granting that the out-of-state plastics industry is burdened relatively more heavily than the Minnesota pulpwood industry, we find that this burden is not “clearly excessive” in light of the substantial state interest in promoting conservation of energy and other natural resources and easing solid waste disposal problems, which we have already reviewed in the context of equal protection analysis. We find these local benefits ample to support Minnesota’s decision under the Commerce Clause. Moreover, we find no approach with “a lesser impact on interstate activities.”</p>

<p id="fbbdbcf1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases presented above demonstrate that the crucial initial inquiry in dormant Commerce Clause cases is whether the law is discriminatory against out-of-staters. In City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, the Court said “where simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtually per se rule of invalidity has been erected.” In C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, the Court declared, “Discrimination against interstate commerce in favor of local business or investment is per se invalid, save in a narrow class of cases in which the municipality can demonstrate, under rigorous scrutiny, that it has no other means to advance a legitimate local interest.” In Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, the Court stated, “When discrimination against commerce of the type we have found is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake.”</p>

<p id="fbbdbcf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal challenges the constitutional validity of [a] section of an ordinance of the City of Madison, Wisconsin, regulating the sale of milk and milk products within the municipality’s jurisdiction. [The] section in issue makes it unlawful to sell any milk as pasteurized unless it has been processed and bottled at an approved pasteurization plant within a radius of five miles from the central square of Madison. Appellant is an Illinois corporation engaged in distributing milk and milk products in Illinois and Wisconsin. It contended below, as it does here, that both the five-mile limit on pasteurization plants and the twenty-five-mile limit on sources of milk violate the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbbdbcf9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City of Madison is the county seat of Dane County. Within the county are some 5,600 dairy farms with total raw milk production in excess of 600,000,000 pounds annually and more than ten times the requirements of Madison. Aside from the milk supplied to Madison, fluid milk produced in the county moves in large quantities to Chicago and more distant consuming areas, and the remainder is used in making cheese, butter and other products.</p>
<p id="fbbdbcfa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant purchases and gathers milk from approximately 950 farms in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, none being within twenty-five miles of Madison. Its pasteurization plants are located at Chemung and Huntley, Illinois, about 65 and 85 miles respectively from Madison. Appellant was denied a license to sell its products within Madison solely because its pasteurization plants were more than five miles away. It is conceded that the milk which appellant seeks to sell in Madison is supplied from farms and processed in plants licensed and inspected by public health authorities of Chicago, and is labeled “Grade A” under the Chicago ordinance which adopts the rating standards recommended by the United States Public Health Service.</p>
<p id="fbbdbcfb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon these facts we find it necessary to determine only the issue raised under the Commerce Clause, for we agree with appellant that the ordinance imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce. [T]his regulation in practical effect excludes from distribution in Madison wholesome milk produced and pasteurized in Illinois. In thus erecting an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the State, Madison plainly discriminates against interstate commerce. This it cannot do, even in the exercise of its unquestioned power to protect the health and safety of its people, if reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, adequate to conserve legitimate local interests, are available. It is immaterial that Wisconsin milk from outside the Madison area is subjected to the same proscription as that moving in interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fbbdbcfc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that reasonable and adequate alternatives are available. If the City of Madison prefers to rely upon its own officials for inspection of distant milk sources, such inspection is readily open to it without hardship for it could charge the actual and reasonable cost of such inspection to the importing producers and <span title="473" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-473">p. 473</span>processors. Moreover, appellee Health Commissioner of Madison testified that as proponent of the local milk ordinance he had submitted the provisions here in controversy and an alternative proposal based on the Model Milk Ordinance recommended by the United States Public Health Service. The model provision imposes no geographical limitation on location of milk sources and processing plants but excludes from the municipality milk not produced and pasteurized conformably to standards as high as those enforced by the receiving city. In implementing such an ordinance, the importing city obtains milk ratings based on uniform standards and established by health authorities in the jurisdiction where production and processing occur. The receiving city may determine the extent of enforcement of sanitary standards in the exporting area by verifying the accuracy of safety ratings of specific plants or of the milkshed in the distant jurisdiction through the United States Public Health Service, which routinely and on request spot checks the local ratings.</p>
<p id="fbbdbcfd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To permit Madison to adopt a regulation not essential for the protection of local health interests and placing a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce would invite a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause. Under the circumstances here presented, the regulation must yield to the principle that “one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation.”</p>

<p id="fbbde414-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once again, a little fish has caused a commotion. See Hughes v. Oklahoma (1979); TVA v. Hill (1978). The fish in this case is the golden shiner, a species of minnow commonly used as live bait in sport fishing. Appellee Robert J. Taylor operates a bait business in Maine. Despite a Maine statute prohibiting the importation of live baitfish, he arranged to have 158,000 live golden shiners delivered to him from outside the State. The shipment was intercepted, and a federal grand jury in the District of Maine indicted Taylor for violating and conspiring to violate the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. Section 3(a)(2)(A) of those Amendments makes it a federal crime “to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any fish or wildlife taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any State or in violation of any foreign law.”</p>
<p id="fbbde415-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taylor moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Maine’s import ban unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce and therefore may not form the basis for a federal prosecution under the Lacey Act. Maine intervened to defend the validity of its statute, arguing that the ban legitimately protects the State’s fisheries from parasites and nonnative species that might be included in shipments of live baitfish.</p>
<p id="fbbde416-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maine’s statute restricts interstate trade in the most direct manner possible, blocking all inward shipments of live baitfish at the State’s border. Still, this fact alone does not render the law unconstitutional. The limitation imposed by the Commerce Clause on state regulatory power “is by no means absolute,” and “the States retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of ‘legitimate local concern,’ even though interstate commerce may be <span title="474" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-474">p. 474</span>affected.” In determining whether a State has overstepped its role in regulating interstate commerce, this Court has distinguished between state statutes that burden interstate transactions only incidentally, and those that affirmatively discriminate against such transactions. While statutes in the first group violate the Commerce Clause only if the burdens they impose on interstate trade are “clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,” Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. (1970), statutes in the second group are subject to more demanding scrutiny. The Court explained in Hughes v. Oklahoma, that once a state law is shown to discriminate against interstate commerce “either on its face or in practical effect,” the burden falls on the State to demonstrate both that the statute “serves a legitimate local purpose,” and that this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.</p>
<p id="fbbde417-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[At] the evidentiary hearing [in] the District Court, [t]hree scientific experts testified for the prosecution and one for the defense. The prosecution experts testified that live baitfish imported into the State posed two significant threats to Maine’s unique and fragile fisheries. First, Maine’s population of wild fish—including its own indigenous golden shiners—would be placed at risk by three types of parasites prevalent in out-of-state baitfish, but not common to wild fish in Maine. Second, nonnative species inadvertently included in shipments of live baitfish could disturb Maine’s aquatic ecology to an unpredictable extent by competing with native fish for food or habitat, by preying on native species, or by disrupting the environment in more subtle ways. The prosecution experts further testified that there was no satisfactory way to inspect shipments of live baitfish for parasites or commingled species. According to their testimony, the small size of baitfish and the large quantities in which they are shipped made inspection for commingled species “a physical impossibility.” Parasite inspection posed a separate set of difficulties because the examination procedure required destruction of the fish.</p>
<p id="fbbde418-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the proffered justification for any local discrimination against interstate commerce must be subjected to “the strictest scrutiny,” Hughes v. Oklahoma, the empirical component of that scrutiny, like any other form of factfinding, is the basic responsibility of district courts, rather than appellate courts. After reviewing the expert testimony presented to the Magistrate, however, we cannot say that the District Court clearly erred in finding that substantial scientific uncertainty surrounds the effect that baitfish parasites and nonnative species could have on Maine’s fisheries. Moreover, we agree with the District Court that Maine has a legitimate interest in guarding against imperfectly understood environmental risks, despite the possibility that they may ultimately prove to be negligible. The constitutional principles underlying the Commerce Clause cannot be read as requiring the State of Maine to sit idly by and wait until potentially irreversible environmental damage has occurred or until the scientific community agrees on what disease organisms are or are not dangerous before it acts to avoid such consequences.</p>
<p id="fbbde419-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbbde41a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is something fishy about this case. Maine is the only State in the Union that blatantly discriminates against out-of-state baitfish by flatly prohibiting their importation. Although golden shiners are already present and thriving in Maine (and, perhaps not coincidentally, the subject of a flourishing domestic industry), Maine excludes golden shiners grown and harvested (and, perhaps not coincidentally sold) in other States. This kind of stark discrimination <span title="475" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-475">p. 475</span>against out-of-state articles of commerce requires rigorous justification by the discriminating State. “When discrimination against commerce of the type we have found is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake.” Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n (1977).</p>
<p id="fbbde41b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the District Court, the Court concludes that uncertainty about possible ecological effects from the possible presence of parasites and nonnative species in shipments of out-of-state shiners suffices to carry the State’s burden of proving a legitimate public purpose. The Court similarly concludes that the State has no obligation to develop feasible inspection procedures that would make a total ban unnecessary. It seems clear, however, that the presumption should run the other way. Since the State engages in obvious discrimination against out-of-state commerce, it should be put to its proof. Ambiguity about dangers and alternatives should actually defeat, rather than sustain, the discriminatory measure.</p>
<p id="fbbe0b2c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to derogate the State’s interest in ecological purity. But the invocation of environmental protection or public health has never been thought to confer some kind of special dispensation from the general principle of non-discrimination in interstate commerce. If Maine wishes to rely on its interest in ecological preservation, it must show that interest, and the infeasibility of other alternatives, with far greater specificity. Otherwise, it must further that asserted interest in a manner far less offensive to the notions of comity and cooperation that underlie the Commerce Clause. Maine’s unquestionable natural splendor notwithstanding, the State has not carried its substantial burden of proving why it cannot meet its environmental concerns in the same manner as other States with the same interest in the health of their fish and ecology. I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="fbbe0b2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the court concludes that a state’s law is not discriminatory—that is, it treats in-staters and out-of-staters alike—then it is subjected to a much less demanding test. Nondiscriminatory laws are upheld as long as the benefits to the government outweigh the burdens on interstate commerce. As presented earlier, it should be remembered that some justices—most notably Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas—object to the subjectivity of this balancing test and even question whether the dormant Commerce Clause should apply in the absence of state discrimination against out-of-staters. Their arguments should be considered during the reading of the following cases.</p>

<p id="fbbe0b36-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbbe0b37-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellee is a company engaged in extensive commercial farming operations in Arizona and California. The appellant is the official charged <span title="476" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-476">p. 476</span>with enforcing the Arizona Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act. A provision of the Act requires that, with certain exceptions, all cantaloupes grown in Arizona and offered for sale must “be packed in regular compact arrangement in closed standard containers approved by the supervisor. . . .” Invoking his authority under that provision, the appellant issued an order prohibiting the appellee company from transporting uncrated cantaloupes from its Parker, Arizona, ranch to nearby Blythe, California, for packing and processing. The company then brought this action in a federal court to enjoin the order as unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fbbe0b38-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are not in dispute, having been stipulated by the parties. The appellee company has for many years been engaged in the business of growing, harvesting, processing, and packing fruits and vegetables at numerous locations in Arizona and California for interstate shipment to markets throughout the Nation. One of the company’s newest operations is at Parker, Arizona, where, pursuant to a 1964 lease with the Secretary of the Interior, the Colorado River Indian Agency, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes, it undertook to develop approximately 6,400 acres of uncultivated, arid land for agricultural use. The company has spent more than $3,000,000 in clearing, leveling, irrigating, and otherwise developing this land. The company began growing cantaloupes on part of the land in 1966, and has harvested a large cantaloupe crop there in each subsequent year. The cantaloupes are considered to be of higher quality than those grown in other areas of the State. Because they are highly perishable, cantaloupes must upon maturity be immediately harvested, processed, packed, and shipped in order to prevent spoilage. The processing and packing operations can be performed only in packing sheds. Because the company had no such facilities at Parker, it transported its 1966 Parker cantaloupe harvest in bulk loads to Blythe, California, 31 miles away, where it operated centralized and efficient packing shed facilities. There the melons were sorted, inspected, packed, and shipped. In 1967 the company again sent its Parker cantaloupe crop to Blythe for sorting, packing, and shipping. In 1968, however, the appellant entered the order here in issue, prohibiting the company from shipping its cantaloupes out of the State unless they were packed in containers in a manner and of a kind approved by the appellant. Because cantaloupes in the quantity involved can be so packed only in packing sheds, and because no such facilities were available to the company at Parker or anywhere else nearby in Arizona, the company faced imminent loss of its anticipated 1968 cantaloupe crop in the gross amount of $700,000.</p>
<p id="fbbe3249-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the criteria for determining the validity of state statutes affecting interstate commerce have been variously stated, the general rule that emerges can be phrased as follows: Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.</p>
<p id="fbbe324a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not dealing here with “state legislation in the field of safety where the propriety of local regulation has long been recognized,” or with an Act designed to protect consumers in Arizona from contaminated or unfit goods. Its purpose <span title="477" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-477">p. 477</span>and design are simply to protect and enhance the reputation of growers within the State. These are surely legitimate state interests.</p>
<p id="fbbe324b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the State’s tenuous interest in having the company’s cantaloupes identified as originating in Arizona cannot constitutionally justify the requirement that the company build and operate an unneeded $200,000 packing plant in the State. The nature of that burden is, constitutionally, more significant than its extent. For the Court has viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere. Even where the State is pursuing a clearly legitimate local interest, this particular burden on commerce has been declared to be virtually per se illegal.</p>
<p id="fbbe324c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the order issued under the Arizona statute does not impose such rigidity on an entire industry, it does impose just such a straitjacket on the appellee company with respect to the allocation of its interstate resources. Such an incidental consequence of a regulatory scheme could perhaps be tolerated if a more compelling state interest were involved. But here the State’s interest is minimal at best—certainly less substantial than a State’s interest in securing employment for its people. If the Commerce Clause forbids a State to require work to be done within its jurisdiction to promote local employment, then surely it cannot permit a State to require a person to go into a local packing business solely for the sake of enhancing the reputation of other producers within its borders.</p>

<p id="fbbe3253-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Douglas</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbbe3254-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are asked in this case to hold that an Illinois statute requiring the use of a certain type of rear fender mudguard on trucks and trailers operated on the highways of that State conflicts with the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The statutory specification for this type of mudguard provides that the guard shall contour the rear wheel, with the inside surface being relatively parallel to the top 90 degrees of the rear 180 degrees of the whole surface. The surface of the guard must extend downward to within 10 inches from the ground when the truck is loaded to its maximum legal capacity. The guards must be wide enough to cover the width of the protected tire, must be installed not more than 6 inches from the tire surface when the vehicle is loaded to maximum capacity, and must have a lip or flange on its outer edge of not less than 2 inches.</p>
<p id="fbbe3255-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees, interstate motor carriers holding certificates from the Interstate Commerce Commission, challenged the constitutionality of the Illinois Act. A specially constituted three-judge District Court concluded that it unduly and unreasonably burdened and obstructed interstate commerce, because it made the conventional or straight mudflap, which is legal in at least 45 States, illegal in Illinois, and because the statute, taken together with a Rule of the Arkansas Commerce Commission requiring straight mudflaps, rendered the use of the same motor vehicle equipment in both States impossible. The statute was <span title="478" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-478">p. 478</span>declared to be violative of the Commerce Clause and appellants were enjoined from enforcing it.</p>
<p id="fbbe5966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power of the State to regulate the use of its highways is broad and pervasive. We have recognized the peculiarly local nature of this subject of safety, and have upheld state statutes applicable alike to interstate and intrastate commerce, despite the fact that they may have an impact on interstate commerce. South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros. (1939).</p>
<p id="fbbe5967-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court. If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective. Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field. Unless we can conclude on the whole record that “the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it,” we must uphold the statute.</p>
<p id="fbbe5968-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that “since it is impossible for a carrier operating in interstate commerce to determine which of its equipment will be used in a particular area, or on a particular day, or days, carriers operating into or through Illinois . . . will be required to equip all their trailers in accordance with the requirements of the Illinois Splash Guard statute.” With two possible exceptions the mudflaps required in those States which have mudguard regulations would not meet the standards required by the Illinois statute. The cost of installing the contour mudguards is $30 or more per vehicle. The District Court found that the initial cost of installing those mudguards on all the trucks owned by the appellees ranged from $4,500 to $45,840. There was also evidence in the record to indicate that the cost of maintenance and replacement of these guards is substantial.</p>
<p id="fbbe5969-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illinois introduced evidence seeking to establish that contour mudguards had a decided safety factor in that they prevented the throwing of debris into the faces of drivers of passing cars and into the windshields of a following vehicle. But the District Court in its opinion stated that it was “conclusively shown that the contour mud flap possesses no advantages over the conventional or straight mud flap previously required in Illinois and presently required in most of the states,” and that “there is rather convincing testimony that use of the contour flap creates hazards previously unknown to those using the highways.” These hazards were found to be occasioned by the fact that this new type of mudguard tended to cause an accumulation of heat in the brake drum, thus decreasing the effectiveness of brakes, and by the fact that they were susceptible of being hit and bumped when the trucks were backed up and of falling off on the highway.</p>
<p id="fbbe596a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An order of the Arkansas Commerce Commission requires that trailers operating in that State be equipped with straight or conventional mudflaps. Vehicles equipped to meet the standards of the Illinois statute would not comply with Arkansas standards, and vice versa. Thus if a trailer is to be operated in both States, mudguards would have to be interchanged, causing a significant delay in an operation where prompt movement may be of the essence. It was found that from two to four hours of labor are required to install or remove a contour mudguard. Moreover, the contour guard is attached to the trailer by welding and if the trailer is conveying a cargo of explosives (e.g., for the United States Government) it would be exceedingly dangerous to attempt to weld on a contour mudguard without unloading the trailer.</p>
<p id="fbbe596b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was also found that the Illinois statute seriously interferes with the “interline” operations of motor carriers—that is to say, with the interchanging of <span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-479">p. 479</span>trailers between an originating carrier and another carrier when the latter serves an area not served by the former. These “interline” operations provide a speedy through-service for the shipper. Interlining contemplates the physical transfer of the entire trailer; there is no unloading and reloading of the cargo. The interlining process is particularly vital in connection with shipment of perishables, which would spoil if unloaded before reaching their destination, or with the movement of explosives carried under seal. Of course, if the originating carrier never operated in Illinois, it would not be expected to equip its trailers with contour mudguards. Yet if an interchanged trailer of that carrier were hauled to or through Illinois, the statute would require that it contain contour guards. Since carriers which operate in and through Illinois cannot compel the originating carriers to equip their trailers with contour guards, they may be forced to cease interlining with those who do not meet the Illinois requirements. Over 60 percent of the business of 5 of the 6 plaintiffs is interline traffic. For the other it constitutes 30 percent. All of the plaintiffs operate extensively in interstate commerce, and the annual mileage in Illinois of none of them exceeds 7 percent of total mileage.</p>
<p id="fbbe596c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We deal not with absolutes but with questions of degree. The state legislatures plainly have great leeway in providing safety regulations for all -vehicles—interstate as well as local. Our decisions so hold. Yet the heavy burden which the Illinois mudguard law places on the interstate movement of trucks and trailers seems to us to pass the permissible limits even for safety regulations.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fbbe596d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the Court has invalidated state laws restricting truck size as violating the dormant commerce clause even though they are not discriminatory against out-of-staters. In Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), the Court unanimously declared unconstitutional a Wisconsin law that generally prevented the operation on state highways of trucks longer than 55 feet and of double-trailer trucks. The law prohibited 65-foot double-trailer trucks, while allowing 55-foot single trucks.</p>
<p id="fbbe596e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concluded that the “regulations violate the Commerce Clause because they place a substantial burden on interstate commerce and they cannot be said to make more than the most speculative contribution to highway safety.” The Court explained that the law put a “substantial burden on the interstate movement of goods” by limiting the ability of trucks to enter Wisconsin. Additionally, the Court said that the State “failed to make even a colorable showing that its regulations contribute to highway safety.”</p>
<p id="fbbe596f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, in Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp., 450 U.S. 662 (1981), the Court declared unconstitutional an Iowa law banning 65-foot double trailers. The Court again weighed the “asserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” The Court said that the “State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-foot singles. . . . Statistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and 60-foot doubles.” Moreover, the Court found that the Iowa law “substantially burdens interstate commerce” by forcing these trucks to avoid Iowa or to detach the trailers and ship them separately.</p>
<p id="fbbe5970-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="480" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-480">p. 480</span>One particular type of nondiscriminatory law is worth noting: The Court has consistently declared unconstitutional state laws that regulate the out-of-state conduct of businesses. In Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624 (1982), the Court declared unconstitutional an Illinois law that required the Secretary of State to adjudicate the fairness of tender offers for the purchase of corporate stock and to reject the transaction if the offer was inequitable or would work a fraud on the sellers. The Court said that the law was a “direct restraint on interstate commerce” because the state was controlling “conduct beyond the boundaries of the state.” The state law regulated sales of stock that occurred outside of Illinois. The Court applied the balancing test and found that the law was unconstitutional because it substantially burdened interstate commerce by “hindering the reallocation of economic resources to their highest-valued use,” but there was “nothing to be weighed in the balance to sustain the law.”</p>
<p id="fbbe5971-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573 (1986), involved a New York law that required liquor distillers selling wholesale in the state to file a monthly price schedule, to sell at those prices in New York, and to sell at the lowest prices the distiller charged wholesale in any other state for the same month. The Court found the latter provision to violate the dormant Commerce Clause because it had the “practical effect of . . . control[ling] liquor prices in other states.” The Court explained, “While New York may regulate the sale of liquor within its borders, and may seek low prices for its residents, it may not project its legislation into other States by regulating the price to be paid for liquor in those states.”</p>
<p id="fbbe5972-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Healy v. The Beer Institute, 491 U.S. 324 (1989), the Court declared unconstitutional a Connecticut law that required beer companies to post their prices each month and to attest that the prices were not higher than their prices in the four states bordering Connecticut. The Court noted that “the Commerce Clause . . . precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside the State’s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State.” The Court said therefore that “[t]he critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.” The Connecticut law was declared unconstitutional because it affected the prices charged out of the state.</p>

Such a law will be allowed only if it is proven that the law is necessary—the least restrictive means—to achieve a nonprotectionist purpose.

The inquiry is fact dependent and the outcome obviously turns on how the Court appraises the burdens and the benefits.</p>

<p id="fbbe8088-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two exceptions where laws that otherwise would violate the dormant Commerce Clause will be allowed.

Even a clearly unconstitutional, discriminatory state law will be allowed if approved by Congress because Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce among the states. The second exception is termed the “market participant exception”: A state may favor its own citizens in receiving benefits from government programs or in dealing with government-owned businesses. Each exception is presented in turn.</p>

<p id="fbbe808b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court consistently has held that the Constitution empowers Congress to regulate commerce among the states and that therefore state laws burdening commerce are permissible, even when they otherwise would violate the dormant Commerce Clause, if they have been approved by Congress. The Court thus declared, “If Congress ordains that the States may freely regulate an aspect of interstate commerce, any action taken by a State within the scope of the congressional authorization is rendered invulnerable to Commerce Clause challenge.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A8A_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A8A_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">17</a></span> This means that Congress may “[confer] . . . upon the States an ability to restrict the flow of interstate commerce that they would not otherwise enjoy.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A90_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A90_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbe808e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This principle has long been followed. For example, in In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545 (1891), the Court upheld a state law restricting the importation and sale of alcoholic beverages. Earlier, the Court had declared unconstitutional an almost identical law from another state,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A99_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A99_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> but Congress then adopted a law expressly permitting such state regulation of alcoholic beverages. In light of the new federal statute, the Court shifted positions and allowed the state law. The Court said that “[t]he power to regulate is solely in the general government, and it is an essential part of that regulation to prescribe the regular means for accomplishing the introduction and incorporation of articles into and with the mass of property in the country or State.”</p>
<p id="fbbea7a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, if Congress has acted, the commerce power no longer is dormant. The issue would be whether the federal law is a constitutional exercise of the commerce power; if so, the law must be followed even if it means upholding laws that otherwise would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. It is interesting that this is one of the few areas where Congress has the clear authority to overrule a Supreme Court decision interpreting the Constitution. If the Court deems a matter to violate the dormant Commerce Clause, Congress can respond by enacting a law approving the action and thereby effectively overruling the Supreme Court. However, although the law will not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, it still can be challenged under other constitutional provisions, such as equal protection or the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.</p>

<p id="fbbea7a8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 685 of the California Insurance Code imposes a retaliatory tax on out-of-state insurers doing business in California, when the insurer’s State of incorporation imposes higher taxes on California insurers doing business in that State than California would otherwise impose on that State’s insurers doing business in California. This case presents the question of the constitutionality of retaliatory taxes assessed by the State of California against appellant Western &amp; Southern Life Insurance Co., an Ohio corporation, and paid under protest for the years 1965 through 1971.</p>
<p id="fbbea7a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a long line of cases stretching back to the early days of the Republic, however, this Court has recognized that the Commerce Clause contains an implied limitation on the power of the States to interfere with or impose burdens on interstate commerce. Even in the absence of congressional action, the courts may decide whether state regulations challenged under the Commerce Clause impermissibly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<p id="fbbea7aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decisions do not, however, limit the authority of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States as it sees fit. In the exercise of this plenary authority, Congress may “confe[r] upon the States an ability to restrict the flow of interstate commerce that they would not otherwise enjoy.” Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc. (1980). If Congress ordains that the States may freely regulate an aspect of interstate commerce, any action taken by a State within the scope of the congressional authorization is rendered invulnerable to Commerce Clause challenge.</p>
<p id="fbbea7ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress removed all Commerce Clause limitations on the authority of the States to regulate and tax the business of insurance when it passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Nevertheless, Western &amp; Southern, joined by the Solicitor General as amicus curiae, argues that the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not permit “anticompetitive state taxation that discriminates against out-of-state insurers.” We find no such limitation in the language or history of the Act.</p>
<p id="fbbecebc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1 of the Act contains a declaration of policy: “Congress declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States.” Section 2 declares: “The business of insurance . . . shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.”</p>
<p id="fbbecebd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unequivocal language of the Act suggests no exceptions. We must therefore reject Western &amp; Southern’s Commerce Clause challenge to the California retaliatory tax: the McCarran-Ferguson Act removes entirely any Commerce Clause restriction upon California’s power to tax the insurance business.</p>
<p id="fbbecebe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, it must be remembered that although a law will not violate the dormant Commerce Clause if there is congressional approval, it still can be challenged under other constitutional provisions. Congressional approval does not excuse a violation of equal protection, or the Privileges and Immunities Clause, or other constitutional provisions besides the dormant Commerce Clause. For <span title="483" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-483">p. 483</span>instance, in Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Ward, 470 U.S. 869 (1985), the Court found that a state tax that discriminated against out-of-state insurance companies violated the Equal Protection Clause, even though a federal law permitted such discriminatory taxes and thus there was not a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>

<p id="fbbecec1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The market participant exception provides that a state may favor its own citizens in dealing with government-owned business and in receiving benefits from government programs. In other words, if the state is literally a participant in the market, such as with a state-owned business, and not a regulator, the dormant Commerce Clause does not apply. Discrimination against out-of-staters is allowed that otherwise would be impermissible.</p>
<p id="fbbecec2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court initially articulated the market participant exception in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794 (1976). In <i>Hughes</i>, the Court upheld a Maryland law designed to rid the state of abandoned automobiles by having the state pay for the destruction of inoperable cars. The state required minimal documentation of ownership from in-state scrap processors, but required more elaborate proof from out-of-state scrap processors through either a certificate of title, a police certificate vesting title, or a bill of sale from a police auction. The Court said that the state was a market participant as it was purchasing the cars, and therefore its discriminatory actions against out-of-staters did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The Court declared, “Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.”</p>

<p id="fbbef4da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue in this case is whether, consistent with the Commerce Clause, the State of South Dakota, in a time of shortage, may confine the sale of the cement it produces solely to its residents.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbbef4db-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">I</p></div>
<p id="fbbef4dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1919, South Dakota undertook plans to build a cement plant. The project, a product of the State’s then prevailing Progressive political movement, was initiated in response to recent regional cement shortages that “interfered with and delayed both public and private enterprises,” and that were “threatening the people of this state.” In 1920, the South Dakota Cement Commission <span title="484" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-484">p. 484</span>anticipated “[t]hat there would be a ready market for the entire output of the plant within the state.” The plant, however, located at Rapid City, soon produced more cement than South Dakotans could use. Over the years, buyers in no less than nine nearby States purchased cement from the State’s plant. Between 1970 and 1977, some 40% of the plant’s output went outside the State.</p>
<p id="fbbef4dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plant’s list of out-of-state cement buyers included petitioner Reeves, Inc. Reeves is a ready-mix concrete distributor organized under Wyoming law and with facilities in Buffalo, Gillette, and Sheridan, Wyoming. From the beginning of its operations in 1958, and until 1978, Reeves purchased about 95% of its cement from the South Dakota plant. In 1977, its purchases were $1,172,000.</p>
<p id="fbbef4de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the 1978 construction season approached, difficulties at the plant slowed production. Meanwhile, a booming construction industry spurred demand for cement both regionally and nationally. The plant found itself unable to meet all orders. Faced with the same type of “serious cement shortage” that inspired the plant’s construction, the Commission “reaffirmed its policy of supplying all South Dakota customers first and to honor all contract commitments, with the remaining volume allocated on a first come, first served basis.”</p>
<p id="fbbef4df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reeves, which had no pre-existing long-term supply contract, was hit hard and quickly by this development. On June 30, 1978, the plant informed Reeves that it could not continue to fill Reeves’ orders, and on July 5, it turned away a Reeves truck. Unable to find another supplier, Reeves was forced to cut production by 76% in mid-July. On July 19, Reeves brought this suit against the Commission, challenging the plant’s policy of preferring South Dakota buyers, and seeking injunctive relief.</p>
<p id="fbbef4e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic distinction between States as market participants and States as market regulators makes good sense and sound law. The Commerce Clause responds principally to state taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national marketplace. There is no indication of a constitutional plan to limit the ability of the States themselves to operate freely in the free market.</p>
<p id="fbbef4e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restraint in this area is also counseled by considerations of state sovereignty, the role of each State “‘as guardian and trustee for its people,’” and “the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer, engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.” Moreover, state proprietary activities may be, and often are, burdened with the same restrictions imposed on private market participants. Evenhandedness suggests that, when acting as proprietors, States should similarly share existing freedoms from federal constraints, including the inherent limits of the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fbbef4e2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, as this case illustrates, the competing considerations in cases involving state proprietary action often will be subtle, complex, politically charged, and difficult to assess under traditional Commerce Clause analysis. Given these factors, the adjustment of interests in this context is a task better suited for Congress than this Court.</p>
<p id="fbbef4e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">South Dakota, as a seller of cement, unquestionably fits the “market participant” label more comfortably than a State acting to subsidize local scrap processors.</p>
<p id="fbbef4e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Powell,</span> with whom Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan,</span> Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">White,</span> and Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbbf1bf5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The South Dakota Cement Commission has ordered that in times of shortage the state cement plant must turn away out-of-state customers until all orders from <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>South Dakotans are filled. This policy represents precisely the kind of economic protectionism that the Commerce Clause was intended to prevent. The Court, however, finds no violation of the Commerce Clause, solely because the State produces the cement. I agree with the Court that the State of South Dakota may provide cement for its public needs without violating the Commerce Clause. But I cannot agree that South Dakota may withhold its cement from interstate commerce in order to benefit private citizens and businesses within the State.</p>
<p id="fbbf1bf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The need to ensure unrestricted trade among the States created a major impetus for the drafting of the Constitution. “The power over commerce . . . was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted their government. . . .” Gibbons v. Ogden (1824). Indeed, the Constitutional Convention was called after an earlier convention on trade and commercial problems proved inconclusive. C. Beard, An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution 61-63 (1935).</p>
<p id="fbbf1bf7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The application of the Commerce Clause to this case should turn on the nature of the governmental activity involved. If a public enterprise undertakes an “integral operatio[n] in areas of traditional governmental functions,” National League of Cities v. Usery (1976), the Commerce Clause is not directly relevant. If, however, the State enters the private market and operates a commercial enterprise for the advantage of its private citizens, it may not evade the constitutional policy against economic Balkanization.</p>
<p id="fbbf1bf8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This distinction derives from the power of governments to supply their own needs and from the purpose of the Commerce Clause itself, which is designed to protect “the natural functioning of the interstate market.” In procuring goods and services for the operation of government, a State may act without regard to the private marketplace and remove itself from the reach of the Commerce Clause. But when a State itself becomes a participant in the private market for other purposes, the Constitution forbids actions that would impede the flow of interstate commerce. These categories recognize no more than the “constitutional line between the State as government and the State as trader.” New York v. United States (1946).</p>
<p id="fbbf1bf9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I share the Court’s desire to preserve state sovereignty. But the Commerce Clause long has been recognized as a limitation on that sovereignty, consciously designed to maintain a national market and defeat economic provincialism. The Court today approves protectionist state policies. In the absence of contrary congressional action, those policies now can be implemented as long as the State itself directly participates in the market.</p>
<p id="fbbf1bfa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By enforcing the Commerce Clause in this case, the Court would work no unfairness on the people of South Dakota. They still could reserve cement for public projects and share in whatever return the plant generated. They could not, however, use the power of the State to furnish themselves with cement forbidden to the people of neighboring States.</p>
<p id="fbbf1bfb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The creation of a free national economy was a major goal of the States when they resolved to unite under the Federal Constitution. The decision today cannot be reconciled with that purpose.</p>

The notice of sale, the prospectus, and the proposed contract for the sale all provided that “[p]rimary manufacture within the State of Alaska will be required as a special provision of the contract.” Under the primary-manufacture requirement, the successful bidder must partially process the timber prior to shipping it outside of the State. The requirement is imposed by contract and does not limit the export of unprocessed timber not owned by the State. The stated purpose of the requirement is to “protect existing industries, provide for the establishment of new industries, derive revenue from all timber resources, and manage the State’s forests on a sustained yield basis.” Governor’s Policy Statement. When it imposes the requirement, the State charges a significantly lower price for the timber than it otherwise would.</p>

It does not operate a mill in Alaska and customarily sells unprocessed logs. When it learned that the primary-manufacture requirement was to be imposed on the Icy Cape sale, it brought an action in Federal District Court seeking an injunction, arguing that the requirement violated the negative implications of the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fbbf4319-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases make clear that if a State is acting as a market participant, rather than as a market regulator, the dormant Commerce Clause places no limitation on its activities. The precise contours of the market-participant doctrine have yet to be established, however, the doctrine having been applied in only three <span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-487">p. 487</span>cases of this Court to date.

<p id="fbbf431a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Alaska contends that its primary-manufacture requirement fits squarely within the market-participant doctrine, arguing that “Alaska’s entry into the market may be viewed as precisely the same type of subsidy to local interests that the Court found unobjectionable in <i>Alexandria Scrap.</i>” However, when Maryland became involved in the scrap market it was as a purchaser of scrap; Alaska, on the other hand, participates in the timber market, but imposes conditions downstream in the timber-processing market. Alaska is not merely subsidizing local timber processing in an amount “roughly equal to the difference between the price the timber would fetch in the absence of such a requirement and the amount the state actually receives.”</p>
<p id="fbbf431b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is clear that the State is more than merely a seller of timber. In the commercial context, the seller usually has no say over, and no interest in, how the product is to be used after sale; in this case, however, payment for the timber does not end the obligations of the purchaser, for, despite the fact that the purchaser has taken delivery of the timber and has paid for it, he cannot do with it as he pleases. Instead, he is obligated to deal with a stranger to the contract after completion of the sale.</p>
<p id="fbbf431c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the State directly subsidized the timber-processing industry by such an amount, the purchaser would retain the option of taking advantage of the subsidy by processing timber in the State or forgoing the benefits of the subsidy and exporting unprocessed timber. Under the Alaska requirement, however, the choice is made for him: if he buys timber from the State he is not free to take the timber out of state prior to processing.</p>
<p id="fbbf431d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The market-participant doctrine permits a State to influence “a discrete, identifiable class of economic activity in which [it] is a major participant.” White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Workers, Inc. Contrary to the State’s contention, the doctrine is not carte blanche to impose any conditions that the State has the economic power to dictate, and does not validate any requirement merely because the State imposes it upon someone with whom it is in contractual privity.</p>
<p id="fbbf6a2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limit of the market-participant doctrine must be that it allows a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions, whether by statute, regulation, or contract, that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market. Unless the “market” is relatively narrowly defined, the doctrine has the potential of swallowing up the rule that States may not impose substantial burdens on interstate commerce even if they act with the permissible state purpose of fostering local industry.</p>

Instead of merely choosing its own trading partners, the State is attempting to govern the private, separate economic relationships of its trading partners; that is, it restricts the post-purchase activity of the purchaser, rather than merely the purchasing activity. In contrast to the situation in <i>White</i>, this restriction on private economic activity takes place after the completion of the parties’ direct commercial obligations, rather than during the course of an ongoing commercial relationship in which the city retained a continuing proprietary interest in the subject of the contract.

<p id="fbbf6a31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the line of distinction drawn in the plurality opinion between the State as market participant and the State as market regulator is both artificial and unconvincing. The plurality draws this line “simply as a matter of intuition,” but then seeks to bolster its intuition through a series of remarks more appropriate to antitrust law than to the Commerce Clause. For example, the plurality complains that the State is using its “leverage” in the timber market to distort consumer choice in the timber-processing market, a classic example of a tying arrangement. And the plurality cites the common-law doctrine of restraints on alienation and the antitrust limits on vertical restraints in dismissing the State’s claim that it could accomplish exactly the same result in other ways.</p>
<p id="fbbf6a32-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality does offer one other reason for its demarcation of the boundary between these two concepts. “[D]ownstream restrictions have a greater regulatory effect than do limitations on the immediate transaction. Instead of merely choosing its own trading partners, the State is attempting to govern the private, separate economic relationships of its trading partners; that is, it restricts the post-purchase activity of the purchaser, rather than merely the purchasing activity.” But, of course, this is not a “reason” at all, but merely a restatement of the conclusion. The line between participation and regulation is what we are trying to determine. To invoke that very distinction in support of the line drawn is merely to fall back again on intuition.</p>
<p id="fbbf6a33-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alaska is merely paying the buyer of the timber indirectly, by means of a reduced price, to hire Alaska residents to process the timber. Under existing precedent, the State could accomplish that same result in any number of ways. For example, the State could choose to sell its timber only to those companies that maintain active primary-processing plants in Alaska. Reeves, Inc. v. Stake (1980). Or the State could directly subsidize the primary-processing industry within the State. Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. (1976). The State could even pay to have the logs processed and then enter the market only to sell processed logs. It seems to me unduly formalistic to conclude that the one path chosen by the State as best suited to promote its concerns is the path forbidden it by the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p id="fbbf6a34-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The underlying policy question is whether there should be a market participant exception. The market participant exception can be criticized on several grounds. First, the dormant Commerce Clause is meant to stop protectionist actions by state governments; protectionism should not be allowed regardless of whether the state is acting in a proprietary or a regulatory capacity. Second, there is not a clear distinction between situations where the government is acting as a regulator and when it is a market participant.</p>
<p id="fbbf6a35-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the market participant exception can be defended as allowing citizens in a state to recoup the benefits of the taxes that they pay.

<p id="fbbf914c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another provision that limits state and local regulation is the Privileges and Immunities Clause found in Article IV, §2. The provision states, “The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision as limiting the ability of a state to discriminate against out-of-staters with regard to fundamental rights or important economic activities. The Court has said that “[t]he section, in effect, prevents a State from discriminating against citizens of other States in favor of its own.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C4F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C4F_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> As presented below, most cases under the Privileges and Immunities Clause involve challenges to state and local laws that discriminate against out-of-staters with regard to their ability to earn a livelihood.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C55_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C55_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> Such discrimination will be allowed only if it is substantially related to achieving a substantial state interest.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C61_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C61_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbfb860-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discrimination against citizens of other states is a prerequisite for application of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C6C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C6C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span> The Supreme Court long has held that the term “citizen” in the Privileges and Immunities Clause is limited to individuals who are United States citizens.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C74_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C74_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> Thus, corporations cannot sue under the Privileges and Immunities Clause because, by definition, they are not citizens.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C7D_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C7D_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span> Nor can aliens sue under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</p>

In fact, the Supreme Court has spoken of the “mutually reinforcing relationship” between the dormant Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C8B_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C8B_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbfb866-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are, however, some key differences. First, the Privileges and Immunities Clause can be used only if there is discrimination against out-of-staters. The dormant Commerce Clause, as explained above, can be used to challenge state and local laws that burden interstate commerce regardless of whether they discriminate against out-of-staters. However, under the dormant Commerce Clause, laws that discriminate are much more likely to be invalidated.</p>
<p id="fbbfb867-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, corporations and aliens can sue under the dormant Commerce Clause, but not the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Privileges and Immunities Clause is expressly limited to “citizens,” whereas no such limitation exists with regard to the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>
<p id="fbbfb868-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, there are two exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause that do not apply to the Privileges and Immunities Clause. If Congress approves state laws, then they do not violate the dormant Commerce Clause; if Congress has acted, its commerce power no longer is dormant. But congressional approval does not excuse a law that violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Also, as described above, there is a market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause that allows states to favor their own citizens in receiving benefits from government programs and in dealing with government-owned businesses. No such exception exists for the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Thus, in White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc., presented above, the Court found that a city law requiring that 50 percent of those hired to work on city construction projects be residents of the city did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because of the market participant exception.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C9C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10C9C_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span> But a year later, in United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Mayor &amp; Council of Camden, presented below, the Court declared unconstitutional a city’s ordinance requiring that at least 40 percent of the employees on city projects be city residents. The Court found that the law violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause and explained that the market participant exception applies only with regard to dormant Commerce Clause challenges.</p>

Second, if there is such discrimination, is there a sufficient justification for the discrimination?

<p id="fbbfdf80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The classic statement of the meaning of the phrase “privileges and immunities” of citizenship was provided by Justice Bushrod Washington in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546, 551, 4 Wash. C.C. 371, No. 3230 (Cir. Ct. E.D. Pa. 1823), when he said that the clause protects interests that “are fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments. [They] may be comprehended under the following general heads: Protection by the government, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety; subject nevertheless to such restraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general good of the whole.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CC8_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CC8_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbfdf82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, the Court said that the Clause applies “[o]nly with respect to those privileges and immunities bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CD7_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CD7_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">32</a></span> The Court also has said that the issue is whether the interest is “sufficiently fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CDD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CDD_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbfdf85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet these and similar statements are abstract and provide relatively little guidance in identifying what are the “privileges and immunities of citizens” under Article IV. It is well settled that the Privileges and Immunities Clause is meant to limit the ability of states to discriminate against citizens from other states, but it is not at all clear as to what constitutes the area—privileges and immunities—where discrimination is forbidden. Indeed, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the contours of [the Clause] are not well developed.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CE6_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CE6_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">34</a></span></p>
<p id="fbbfdf87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Examining the cases concerning the Privileges and Immunities Clause reveals that the Court primarily has applied it in two contexts: (1) when a state is discriminating against out-of-staters with regard to constitutional rights and (2) when a state is discriminating against out-of-staters with regard to important economic activities. The latter almost always arises in the context of a state discriminating against out-of-staters with regard to their ability to earn a livelihood. The Court has refused to apply the Privileges and Immunities Clause in situations where the discrimination against out-of-staters has involved neither constitutional rights nor important economic activities.</p>
<p id="fbbfdf88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights seem the most obvious and the most basic “privileges and immunities of citizenship.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CF3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10CF3_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span> Generally, however<span title="492" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-492">p. 492</span>, there is no need to use the Privileges and Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally guaranteed rights. If a state were to prevent out-of-staters from engaging in religious worship, a challenge certainly could be brought under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Most likely, though, the suit would be brought under the First Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc0069a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although such cases arise only relatively rarely, the Privileges and Immunities Clause can be used to challenge state and local laws that discriminate against out-of-staters with regard to the exercise of constitutional rights. For example, in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), the Supreme Court concluded that a state could not limit the ability of out-of-staters to obtain abortions in the state. <i>Doe</i> was a companion case to Roe v. Wade<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D04_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10D04_ef81049c-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span> and involved a Georgia law that allowed residents to obtain an abortion if a physician determined that continuing the pregnancy would endanger a woman’s life or health, the fetus would be born with a serious defect, or the pregnancy resulted from rape. The Court declared the law unconstitutional and invalidated the residency requirement based on the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Court said, “Just as the Privileges and Immunities Clause . . . protects persons who enter other States to ply their trade, so must it protect persons who enter Georgia seeking the medical services that are available there. A contrary holding would mean that a State could limit to its own residents the general medical care available within its borders. This we could not approve.”</p>
<p id="fbc0069c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court has made clear that for the Privileges and Immunities Clause to be applied on this basis a fundamental right must be involved. In McBurney v. Young, 569 U.S. 221 (2013), the Court considered “whether the Virginia Freedom of Information Act violates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV. . . . The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides that ‘all public records shall be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,’ but it grants no such right to non- Virginians.” The Court concluded that the law did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause because no fundamental right was implicated. The Court explained: “This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no constitutional right to obtain all the information provided by FOIA laws. It certainly cannot be said that such a broad right has ‘at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several states which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign.’ No such right was recognized at common law. Most founding-era English cases provided that only those persons who had a personal interest in non-judicial records were permitted to access them.”</p>
<p id="fbc0069d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The vast majority of cases under the Privileges and Immunities Clause involve states discriminating against out-of-staters with regard to their ability to earn their livelihood.

<p id="fbc006a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a suit to enjoin as unconstitutional the enforcement of several South Carolina statutes governing commercial shrimp fishing in the three-mile maritime belt off the coast of that State. The statutes appellants challenge relate to shrimping during the open season in the three-mile belt: Section 3300 of the South Carolina Code provides that the waters in that area shall be “a common for the people of the State for the taking of fish.” Section 3379, as amended in 1947, requires payment of a license fee of $25 for each shrimp boat owned by a resident, and of $2,500 for each one owned by a non-resident.</p>
<p id="fbc006a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, who initiated the action, are five individual fishermen, all citizens and residents of Georgia, and a non-profit fish dealers’ organization incorporated in Florida. The purpose and effect of this statute, they contend, is not to conserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby create a commercial monopoly for South Carolina residents. As such, the statute is said to violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, §2, of the Constitution and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc006a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary purpose of this clause, like the clauses between which it is located—those relating to full faith and credit and to interstate extradition of fugitives from justice—was to help fuse into one Nation a collection of independent, sovereign States. It was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures into State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy. For protection of such equality the citizen of State A was not to be restricted to the uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic processes and official retaliation. Indeed, without some provision of the kind removing from the citizens of each State the disabilities of alienage in the other States, and giving them equality of privilege with citizens of those States, the Republic would have constituted little more than a league of States; it would not have constituted the Union which now exists. In line with this underlying purpose, it was long ago decided that one of the privileges which the clause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing business in State B on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that State.</p>

It does bar discrimination against citizens of other States where there is no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other States. But it does not preclude disparity of treatment in the many situations where there are perfectly valid independent reasons for it. Thus the inquiry in each case must be concerned with whether such reasons do exist and whether the degree of discrimination bears a close relation to them. The inquiry must also, of course, be conducted with due regard for the principle that the States should have considerable leeway in analyzing local evils and in prescribing appropriate cures.</p>
<p id="fbc02db8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these factors in mind, we turn to a consideration of the constitutionality of §3379. By that statute South Carolina plainly and frankly discriminates against non-residents, and the record leaves little doubt but what the discrimination is so great that its practical effect is virtually exclusionary. As justification for the statute, appellees urge that the State’s obvious purpose was to conserve its shrimp supply, and they suggest that it was designed to head off an impending <span title="494" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-494">p. 494</span>threat of excessive trawling. The record casts some doubt on these statements. But in any event, appellees’ argument assumes that any means adopted to attain valid objectives necessarily squares with the Privileges and Immunities Clause. It overlooks the purpose of that clause, which, as indicated above, is to outlaw classifications based on the fact of non-citizenship unless there is something to indicate that non-citizens constitute a peculiar source of the evil at which the statute is aimed. Thus, §3379 must be held unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fbc02dbe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court</p>
<p id="fbc02dbf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A municipal ordinance of the city of Camden, New Jersey requires that at least 40% of the employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be Camden residents. Appellant, the United Building and Construction Trades Council of Camden and Vicinity (the Council), challenges that ordinance as a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Article IV, §2, of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbc02dc0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first address the argument, accepted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, that the Clause does not even apply to a municipal ordinance such as this. Two separate contentions are advanced in support of this position: first, that the Clause only applies to laws passed by a State and, second, that the Clause only applies to laws that discriminate on the basis of state citizenship. The first argument can be quickly rejected. The fact that the ordinance in question is a municipal, rather than a state, law does not somehow place it outside the scope of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. First of all, one cannot easily distinguish municipal from state action in this case: the municipal ordinance would not have gone into effect without express approval by the State Treasurer. More fundamentally, a municipality is merely a political subdivision of the State from which its authority derives. It is as true of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as of the Equal Protection Clause that what would be unconstitutional if done directly by the State can no more readily be accomplished by a city deriving its authority from the State.</p>
<p id="fbc02dc1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second argument merits more consideration. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the Privileges and Immunities Clause does not apply to an ordinance that discriminates solely on the basis of municipal residency. The Clause is phrased in terms of state citizenship and was designed “to place the citizens of each State upon the same footing with citizens of other States, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those States are concerned.” Paul v. Virginia (1869).</p>
<p id="fbc02dc2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Municipal residency classifications, it is argued, simply do not give rise to the same concerns. We cannot accept this argument. We have never read the Clause so literally as to apply it only to distinctions based on state citizenship. A person who is not residing in a given State is ipso facto not residing in a city within that State. Thus, whether the exercise of a privilege is conditioned on state residency or on municipal residency he will just as surely be excluded. Given the Camden ordinance, an out-of-state citizen who ventures into New Jersey will not enjoy the same privileges as the New Jersey citizen residing in Camden. It is true that <span title="495" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-495">p. 495</span>New Jersey citizens not residing in Camden will be affected by the ordinance as well as out-of-state citizens. And it is true that the disadvantaged New Jersey residents have no claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. But New Jersey residents at least have a chance to remedy at the polls any discrimination against them. Out-of-state citizens have no similar opportunity and they must “not be restricted to the uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic processes and official retaliation.” Toomer v. Witsell (1948). We conclude that Camden’s ordinance is not immune from constitutional review at the behest of out-of-state residents merely because some in-state residents are similarly disadvantaged.</p>
<p id="fbc02dc3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Application of the Privileges and Immunities Clause to a particular instance of discrimination against out-of-state residents entails a two-step inquiry. As an initial matter, the court must decide whether the ordinance burdens one of those privileges and immunities protected by the Clause. As a threshold matter, then, we must determine whether an out-of-state resident’s interest in employment on public works contracts in another State is sufficiently “fundamental” to the promotion of interstate harmony so as to “fall within the purview of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.” Certainly, the pursuit of a common calling is one of the most fundamental of those privileges protected by the Clause. Many, if not most, of our cases expounding the Privileges and Immunities Clause have dealt with this basic and essential activity.</p>
<p id="fbc02dc4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that Camden’s ordinance discriminates against a protected privilege does not, of course, end the inquiry. It does not preclude discrimination against citizens of other States where there is a “substantial reason” for the difference in treatment. The city of Camden contends that its ordinance is necessary to counteract grave economic and social ills. Spiralling unemployment, a sharp decline in population, and a dramatic reduction in the number of businesses located in the city have eroded property values and depleted the city’s tax base. The resident hiring preference is designed, the city contends, to increase the number of employed persons living in Camden and to arrest the “middle class flight” currently plaguing the city. The city also argues that all non-Camden residents employed on city public works projects, whether they reside in New Jersey or Pennsylvania, constitute a “source of the evil at which the statute is aimed.” That is, they “live off” Camden without “living in” Camden. Camden contends that the scope of the discrimination practiced in the ordinance, with its municipal residency requirement, is carefully tailored to alleviate this evil without unreasonably harming nonresidents, who still have access to 60% of the available positions.</p>
<p id="fbc054d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, we find it impossible to evaluate Camden’s justification on the record as it now stands. No trial has ever been held in the case. No findings of fact have been made. The Supreme Court of New Jersey certified the case for direct appeal after the brief administrative proceedings that led to approval of the ordinance by the State Treasurer. It would not be appropriate for this Court either to make factual determinations as an initial matter or to take judicial notice of Camden’s decay. We, therefore, deem it wise to remand the case to the New Jersey Supreme Court. That court may decide, consistent with state procedures, on the best method for making the necessary findings.</p>

<p id="fbc054d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Toomer v. Witsell and United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v.

<p id="fbc054dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents issues under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution’s Art. IV, §2, as to the constitutional validity of disparities, as between residents and nonresidents, in a State’s hunting license system. For the 1975 hunting season, a Montana resident could purchase a license solely for elk for $4. The nonresident, however, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $151; this entitled him to take one elk and two deer. For the 1976 season, the Montana resident could purchase a license solely for elk for $9. The nonresident, in order to hunt elk was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, one black bear, and game birds, and to fish with hook and line. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses, but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. The nonresident thus paid 7&amp;#x00BD; times as much as the resident, and if the nonresident wished to hunt only elk, he paid 25 times as much as the resident.</p>
<p id="fbc054de-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Lester Baldwin is a Montana resident. He also is an outfitter holding a state license as a hunting guide. The majority of his customers are nonresidents who come to Montana to hunt elk and other big game. Appellants Carlson, Huseby, Lee and Moris are residents of Minnesota. They have hunted big game, particularly elk, in Montana in past years and wish to continue to do so.</p>
<p id="fbc054df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1975, the five appellants, disturbed by the difference in the kinds of Montana elk-hunting licenses available to nonresidents, as contrasted with those available to residents of the State, and by the difference in the fees the nonresident and the resident must pay for their respective licenses, instituted the present federal suit for declaratory and injunctive relief and for reimbursement, in part, of fees already paid.</p>
<p id="fbc054e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants strongly urge here that the Montana licensing scheme for the hunting of elk violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV §2, of our Constitution. That Clause is not one the contours of which have been precisely shaped by the process and wear of constant litigation and judicial interpretation over the years since 1789.</p>
<p id="fbc054e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Privileges and Immunities Clause has been applied to specific cases, it has been interpreted to prevent a State from imposing unreasonable burdens on citizens of other States in their pursuit of common callings within the State; in the ownership and disposition of privately held property within the State; and in access to the courts of the State.</p>
<p id="fbc07bf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has not been suggested, however, that state citizenship or residency may never be used by a State to distinguish among persons. Suffrage, for example, always has been understood to be tied to an individual’s identification with a particular State. No one would suggest that the <span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-497">p. 497</span>Privileges and Immunities Clause requires a State to open its polls to a person who declines to assert that the State is the only one where he claims a right to vote. The same is true as to qualification for an elective office of the State. Some distinctions between residents and nonresidents merely reflect the fact that this is a Nation composed of individual States, and are permitted; other distinctions are prohibited because they hinder the formation, the purpose, or the development of a single Union of those States. Only with respect to those “privileges” and “immunities” bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity must the State treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, equally. Here we must decide into which category falls a distinction with respect to access to recreational big-game hunting. Does the distinction made by Montana between residents and nonresidents in establishing access to elk hunting threaten a basic right in a way that offends the Privileges and Immunities Clause? Merely to ask the question seems to provide the answer. We repeat much of what already has been said above: Elk hunting by nonresidents in Montana is a recreation and a sport. In itself—wholly apart from license fees—it is costly and obviously available only to the wealthy nonresident or to the one so taken with the sport that he sacrifices other values in order to indulge in it and to enjoy what it offers. It is not a means to the nonresident’s livelihood. The mastery of the animal and the trophy are the ends that are sought; appellants are not totally excluded from these. The elk supply, which has been entrusted to the care of the State by the people of Montana, is finite and must be carefully tended in order to be preserved.</p>
<p id="fbc07bf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ interest in sharing this limited resource on more equal terms with Montana residents simply does not fall within the purview of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Equality in access to Montana elk is not basic to the maintenance or well-being of the Union. Appellants do not—and cannot— contend that they are deprived of a means of a livelihood by the system or of access to any part of the State to which they may seek to travel. Whatever rights or activities may be “fundamental” under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, we are persuaded, and hold, that elk hunting by nonresidents in Montana is not one of them.</p>

In 1979, she applied to take the February 1980 New Hampshire bar examination. Piper submitted with her application a statement of intent to become a New Hampshire resident. Following an investigation, the Board of Bar Examiners found that Piper was of good moral character and met the other requirements for admission. She was allowed to take, and passed, the examination. Piper was informed by the Board that she would have to establish a home address in New Hampshire prior to being sworn in.</p>
<p id="fbc07bff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Derived, like the Commerce Clause, from the fourth of the Articles of Confederation, the Privileges and Immunities Clause was intended to create a national economic union. It is therefore not surprising that this Court repeatedly has found that “one of the privileges which the Clause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing business in State B on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that State.” Toomer v. Witsell. There is nothing in [prior decisions] suggesting that the practice of law should not be viewed as a “privilege” under Art. IV, §4, 6. Like the occupations considered in our earlier cases, the practice of law is important to the national economy.</p>
<p id="fbc0a310-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lawyer’s role in the national economy is not the only reason that the opportunity to practice law should be considered a “fundamental right.” We believe that the legal profession has a noncommercial role and duty that reinforce the view that the practice of law falls within the ambit of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Out-of-state lawyers may—and often do—represent persons who raise unpopular federal claims. In some cases, representation by nonresident counsel may be the only means available for the vindication of federal rights.</p>
<p id="fbc0a311-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that Rule 42 deprives nonresidents of a protected privilege does not end our inquiry. The Court has stated that “[l]ike many other constitutional provisions, the Privileges and Immunities Clause is not an absolute.” The Clause does not preclude discrimination against nonresidents where (i) there is a substantial reason for the difference in treatment; and (ii) the discrimination practiced against nonresidents bears a substantial relationship to the State’s objective. In deciding whether the discrimination bears a close or substantial relationship to the State’s objective, the Court has considered the availability of less restrictive means.</p>
<p id="fbc0a312-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of New Hampshire offers several justifications for its refusal to admit nonresidents to the bar. It asserts that nonresident members would be less likely (i) to become, and remain, familiar with local rules and procedures; (ii) to behave ethically; (iii) to be available for court proceedings; and (iv) to do pro bono and other volunteer work in the State. We find that none of these reasons meets the test of “substantiality,” and that the means chosen do not bear the necessary relationship to the State’s objectives.</p>
<p id="fbc0a313-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no evidence to support appellant’s claim that nonresidents might be less likely to keep abreast of local rules and procedures. Nor may we assume that a nonresident lawyer—anymore than a resident—would disserve his clients by failing to familiarize himself with the rules. As a practical matter, we think that unless a lawyer has, or anticipates, a considerable practice in the New Hampshire courts, he would be unlikely to take the bar examination and pay the annual dues of $125.</p>
<p id="fbc0a314-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Hampshire’s “simple residency” requirement is underinclusive as well, because it permits lawyers who move away from the State to retain their membership in the bar. There is no reason to believe that a former resident would <span title="499" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-499">p. 499</span>maintain a more active practice in the New Hampshire courts than would a nonresident lawyer who had never lived in the State.</p>
<p id="fbc0a315-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also find the appellant’s second justification to be without merit, for there is no reason to believe that a nonresident lawyer will conduct his practice in a dishonest manner. The nonresident lawyer’s professional duty and interest in his reputation should provide the same incentive to maintain high ethical standards as they do for resident lawyers. A lawyer will be concerned with his reputation in any community where he practices, regardless of where he may live. Furthermore, a nonresident lawyer may be disciplined for unethical conduct.</p>
<p id="fbc0a316-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is more merit to the appellant’s assertion that a nonresident member of the bar at times would be unavailable for court proceedings. In the course of litigation, pretrial hearings on various matters often are held on short notice. At times a court will need to confer immediately with counsel. Even the most conscientious lawyer residing in a distant State may find himself unable to appear in court for an unscheduled hearing or proceeding. Nevertheless, we do not believe that this type of problem justifies the exclusion of nonresidents from the state bar. One may assume that a high percentage of nonresident lawyers willing to take the state bar examination and pay the annual dues will reside in places reasonably convenient to New Hampshire. Furthermore, in those cases where the nonresident counsel will be unavailable on short notice, the State can protect its interests through less restrictive means. The trial court, by rule or as an exercise of discretion, may require any lawyer who resides at a great distance to retain a local attorney who will be available for unscheduled meetings and hearings.</p>
<p id="fbc0a317-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final reason advanced by appellant is that nonresident members of the state bar would be disinclined to do their share of pro bono and volunteer work. Perhaps this is true to a limited extent, particularly where the member resides in a distant location. We think it is reasonable to believe, however, that most lawyers who become members of a state bar will endeavor to perform their share of these services. This sort of participation, of course, would serve the professional interest of a lawyer who practices in the State. Furthermore, a nonresident bar member, like the resident member, could be required to represent indigents and perhaps to participate in formal legal-aid work.</p>
<p id="fbc0a318-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, appellant neither advances a “substantial reason” for its discrimination against nonresident applicants to the bar, nor demonstrates that the discrimination practiced bears a close relationship to its proffered objectives.</p>
<p id="fbc0a319-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our holding in this case does not interfere with the ability of the States to regulate their bars. The nonresident who seeks to join a bar, unlike the pro hac vice applicant, must have the same professional and personal qualifications required of resident lawyers. Furthermore, the nonresident member of the bar is subject to the full force of New Hampshire’s disciplinary rules.</p>

<p id="fbc0a31b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court holds that New Hampshire cannot decide that a New Hampshire lawyer should live in New Hampshire. This may not be surprising to those who view law as just another form of business frequently practiced across state lines by interchangeable actors; the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, §2, has long been held to apply to States’ attempts to discriminate against nonresidents who seek to ply their trade interstate. The decision will be surprising to many, however, because it so clearly disregards the fact that the <span title="500" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-500">p. 500</span>practice of law is—almost by definition—fundamentally different from those other occupations that are practiced across state lines without significant deviation from State to State. The fact that each State is free, in a large number of areas, to establish independently of the other States its own laws for the governance of its citizens, is a fundamental precept of our Constitution that, I submit, is of equal stature with the need for the States to form a cohesive union. What is at issue here is New Hampshire’s right to decide that those people who in many ways will intimately deal with New Hampshire’s self-governance should reside within that State.</p>
<p id="fbc0a31c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] State has a very strong interest in seeing that its legislators and its judges come from among the constituency of state residents, so that they better understand the local interests to which they will have to respond. Unlike the Court, I would recognize that the State also has a very “substantial” interest in seeing that its lawyers also are members of that constituency.</p>
<p id="fbc0a31d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My belief that the practice of law differs from other trades and businesses for Art. IV, §2, purposes is not based on some notion that law is for some reason a superior profession. The reason that the practice of law should be treated differently is that law is one occupation that does not readily translate across state lines. Certain aspects of legal practice are distinctly and intentionally nonnational; in this regard one might view this country’s legal system as the antithesis of the norms embodied in the Art. IV Privileges and Immunities Clause. Put simply, the State has a substantial interest in creating its own set of laws responsive to its own local interests, and it is reasonable for a State to decide that those people who have been trained to analyze law and policy are better equipped to write those state laws and adjudicate cases arising under them. The State therefore may decide that it has an interest in maximizing the number of resident lawyers, so as to increase the quality of the pool from which its lawmakers can be drawn. A residency law such as the one at issue is the obvious way to accomplish these goals. Since at any given time within a State there is only enough legal work to support a certain number of lawyers, each out-of-state lawyer who is allowed to practice necessarily takes legal work that could support an in-state lawyer, who would otherwise be available to perform various functions that a State has an interest in promoting.</p>
<p id="fbc0ca2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, I find the Court’s “less restrictive means” analysis both ill-advised and potentially unmanageable. Initially I would note, as I and other Members of this Court have before, that such an analysis, when carried too far, will ultimately lead to striking down almost any statute on the ground that the Court could think of another “less restrictive” way to write it. This approach to judicial review, far more than the usual application of a standard of review, tends to place courts in the position of second-guessing legislators on legislative matters. Surely this is not a consequence to be desired. In any event, I find the less-restrictive-means analysis, which is borrowed from our First Amendment jurisprudence, to be out of place in the context of the Art. IV Privileges and Immunities Clause.</p>
<p id="fbc0ca2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is yet another interest asserted by the State that I believe would justify a decision to limit membership in the state bar to state residents. The State argues that out-of-state bar members pose a problem in situations where counsel must be available on short notice to represent clients on unscheduled matters. The Court brushes this argument aside, speculating that “a high percentage of nonresident lawyers willing to take the state bar examination and pay the annual dues will reside in places reasonably convenient to New Hampshire,” and suggesting that <span title="501" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-501">p. 501</span>in any event the trial court could alleviate this problem by requiring the lawyer to retain local counsel. Assuming that the latter suggestion does not itself constitute unlawful discrimination under the Court’s test, there nevertheless may be good reasons why a State or a trial court would rather not get into structuring attorney-client relationships by requiring the retention of local counsel for emergency matters. The situation would have to be explained to the client, and the allocation of responsibility between resident and nonresident counsel could cause as many problems as the Court’s suggestion might cure.</p>
<p id="fbc0ca30-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do I believe that the problem can be confined to emergency matters. The Court admits that even in the ordinary course of litigation a trial judge will want trial lawyers to be available on short notice; the uncertainties of managing a trial docket are such that lawyers rarely are given a single date on which a trial will begin; they may be required to “stand by”—or whatever the local terminology is—for days at a time, and then be expected to be ready in a matter of hours, with witnesses, when the case in front of them suddenly settles. A State reasonably can decide that a trial court should not have added to its present scheduling difficulties the uncertainties and added delays fostered by counsel who might reside 1,000 miles from New Hampshire. If there is any single problem with state legal systems that this Court might consider “substantial,” it is the problem of delay in litigation—a subject that has been profusely explored in the literature over the past several years. Surely the State has a substantial interest in taking steps to minimize this problem.</p>
<p id="fbc0ca31-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, I think that New Hampshire had more than enough “substantial reasons” to conclude that its lawyers should also be its residents. I would hold that the Rule of the New Hampshire Supreme Court does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV.</p>
