<p id="fbc732d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text of the Constitution, apart from the Bill of Rights, contains few provisions concerning individual liberties. Article I, §9, which places limits on Congress’s powers, declares that “[t]he privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may require it.” Article I, §9 also states, “No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.” Article I, §10, which contains limits on state government powers, similarly provides, “No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.”</p>
<p id="fbc732d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article III, §2 states that “[t]he trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.” Article III, §3 also provides, “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them or, in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.” Section 3 concludes by declaring that although Congress may prescribe the punishment for treason, there shall be no “Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attained.” In other words, only the traitor can be punished; family members and future generations cannot be sanctioned because of someone else’s wrongdoing.</p>
<p id="fbc732d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Article VI concludes that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office of public Trust under the United States.” In Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), the Supreme Court used the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to impose a similar requirement on state governments. In <i>Torcaso</i>, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state constitutional provision that required a declaration of a belief in God as a prerequisite to taking public office.</p>
<p id="fbc732d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="504" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-504">p. 504</span>Although these provisions are not trivial, they are minor compared with the protection of liberties found in the Bill of Rights. The seven Articles of the Constitution are primarily about the structure of government and not individual rights.</p>
<p id="fbc732d8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why is there so little in the text of the Constitution about individual liberties? In part, this was because the framers thought that an enumeration of rights was unnecessary in that they had created a government with limited powers and thus without the authority to violate basic liberties. In part, too, the framers were concerned that the enumeration of some rights in the text of the Constitution inevitably would be incomplete and thus would deny protection to those not listed. The Ninth Amendment was added to address this latter concern and provides, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”</p>
<p id="fbc732d9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several states, however, were concerned about the absence of an enumeration of rights and ratified the Constitution with a request that it would be amended to add a Bill of Rights. In the first Congress, James Madison drafted 16 amendments; 12 were ratified by Congress and 10 by the states. These became known as the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p id="fbc732da-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section B considers the application of the Bill of Rights to states. As discussed below, the Supreme Court initially concluded that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10045_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10045_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> The Fourteenth Amendment’s clause, that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,” might have been a basis for applying the Bill of Rights to the states. However, in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, in 1872, the Supreme Court interpreted the clause in an extremely narrow manner and thus precluded its use as a vehicle for applying the Bill of Rights to the states.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004E_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004E_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> In the twentieth century, the Supreme Court applied most of the Bill of Rights to the states by finding that the provisions were incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc732dd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section C examines the application of constitutional rights to private entities and individuals. The basic rule, often termed “the state action doctrine,” is that such rights only apply to the government; private entities and individuals are not required to comply with the Constitution. The rationale for this doctrine and its exceptions are considered in detail in section C.</p>

<p id="fbc759f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bill of Rights, of course, is the first ten amendments to the Constitution. The first eight amendments detail protection of individual rights. Some, such as the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech and religion and the <span title="505" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-505">p. 505</span>criminal procedure protections of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, are the subject of frequent litigation. Others, such as the Third Amendment’s right against having soldiers quartered in a person’s home, have no contemporary significance. The Ninth Amendment provides, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” The Tenth Amendment, discussed in detail in Chapter 2, states, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p id="fbc759f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue arose early in American history as to whether the Bill of Rights applies to state and local governments. The Supreme Court definitively answered that question in the following case.</p>

<p id="fbc759fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff in error contends that the fifth amendment to the constitution, which inhibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation [has been violated]. He insists, that this amendment being in favor of the liberty of the citizen, ought to be so construed as to restrain the legislative power of a state, as well as that of the United States.</p>
<p id="fbc759fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty. The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states. Each state established a constitution for itself, and in that constitution, provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular government, as its judgment dictated. The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed best adapted to their situation and best calculated to promote their interests. The powers they conferred on this government were to be exercised by itself; and the limitations on power, if expressed in general terms, are naturally, and, we think, necessarily, applicable to the government created by the instrument. They are limitations of power granted in the instrument itself; not of distinct governments, framed by different persons and for different purposes.</p>
<p id="fbc759fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must be understood as restraining the power of the general government, not as applicable to the states. In their several constitutions, they have imposed such restrictions on their respective governments, as their own wisdom suggested; such as they deemed most proper for themselves. It is a subject on which they judge exclusively, and with which others interfere no further than they are supposed to have a common interest.</p>
<p id="fbc759fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But it is universally understood, it is a part of the history of the day, that the great revolution which established the constitution of the United States, was not effected without immense opposition. Serious fears were extensively <span title="506" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-506">p. 506</span>entertained, that those powers which the patriot statesmen, who then watched over the interests of our country, deemed essential to union, and to the attainment of those unvaluable objects for which union was sought, might be exercised in a manner dangerous to liberty. In almost every convention by which the constitution was adopted, amendments to guard against the abuse of power were recommended. These amendments demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government—not against those of the local governments. In compliance with a sentiment thus generally expressed, to quiet fears thus extensively entertained, amendments were proposed by the required majority in congress, and adopted by the states.</p>
<p id="fbc759ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These amendments contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the state governments. This court cannot so apply them.</p>
<p id="fbc75a00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of opinion, that the provision in the fifth amendment to the constitution, declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use, without just compensation, is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the states.</p>
<p id="fbc75a01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From a late-twentieth-century perspective, it is troubling that state and local governments were free to violate basic constitutional rights. Yet, at the time of its decision, <i>Barron</i> made sense because of faith in state constitutions and because of the shared understanding that the Bill of Rights was meant to apply only to the federal government. As Professor John Hart Ely noted, “In terms of the original understanding, <i>Barron</i> was almost certainly decided correctly.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100C1_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100C1_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span></p>

<p id="fbc78115-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment, adopted after the Civil War, declares, “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” It might be argued that this provision was meant to apply the Bill of Rights to the states; the Bill of Rights would seem to be the most basic “privileges or immunities” of citizenship. Indeed, Justice Hugo Black declared that “the words ‘No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States’ seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100DF_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100DF_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc78117-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical accuracy of Justice Black’s claim concerning the Privileges or Immunities Clause is uncertain. On the one hand, the choice of the words “privileges” and “immunities” suggests that the framers intended to protect fundamental rights from state and local interference. The words “privileges” and “immunities” were already a part of the Constitution in Article IV, §2 (discussed in Chapter 4), which prevents a state from denying citizens of other states the privileges and immunities it accords its own citizens. More than 40 years before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice Washington stated that the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV protected rights “which are, <span title="507" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-507">p. 507</span>in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100EA_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100EA_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">5</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc78119-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the congressional debate over the Fourteenth Amendment, representatives and senators said that the Fourteenth Amendment Privileges or Immunities Clause was meant to protect basic rights from state interference. Senator Howard, for example, quoted Justice Washington’s earlier statement as to the meaning of privileges and immunities and declared, “Such is the character of the privileges and immunities spoken of in the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution. To these privileges and immunities . . . should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F3_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100F3_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span> Likewise, Representative Bingham, who is credited with drafting the provision, stated that “the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States [are] chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F9_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N100F9_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc7811c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet the historical claim that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was meant to apply the Bill of Rights to the states is very much disputed. Charles Fairman, in an exhaustive study of the framers’ intent on this issue, concluded, “[The theory that the] privileges or immunities clause incorporated Amendments I to VIII found no recognition in the practice of Congress, or the action of state legislatures, constitutional conventions, or courts. . . . Congress would not have attempted such a thing, the country would not have stood for it, the legislatures would not have ratified.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10102_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10102_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">8</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc7811e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is so often the case in discussing the framers’ intent, there probably was not a single view within the Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment or the states that ratified it as to whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause was meant to apply the Bill of Rights to the states. Some of the members of Congress and the state legislatures probably believed that the Privileges or Immunities Clause included the Bill of Rights; some probably didn’t think so; and many probably didn’t consider the question.</p>
<p id="fbc7811f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from claims based on the framers’ intent, a strong argument can be made that the Privileges or Immunities Clause should be interpreted as applying the Bill of Rights to the states. The claim would be that the provisions of the Bill of Rights are the basic “privileges” and “immunities” possessed by all citizens. That argument, however, was foreclosed in the first Supreme Court case to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment: the <i>Slaughter-House Cases.</i></p>

This constituted the war of the rebellion, and whatever auxiliary causes may <span title="509" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-509">p. 509</span>have contributed to bring about this war, undoubtedly the overshadowing and efficient cause was African slavery.</p>
<p id="fbc7a83c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that struggle slavery, as a legalized social relation, perished. It perished as a necessity of the bitterness and force of the conflict.</p>
<p id="fbc7a83d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the armies of freedom found themselves upon the soil of slavery they could do nothing less than free the poor victims whose enforced servitude was the foundation of the quarrel. And when hard pressed in the contest these men (for they proved themselves men in that terrible crisis) offered their services and were accepted by thousands to aid in suppressing the unlawful rebellion, slavery was at an end wherever the Federal government succeeded in that purpose. The proclamation of President Lincoln expressed an accomplished fact as to a large portion of the insurrectionary districts, when he declared slavery abolished in them all. But the war being over, those who had succeeded in re-establishing the authority of the Federal government were not content to permit this great act of emancipation to rest on the actual results of the contest or the proclamation of the Executive, both of which might have been questioned in after times, and they determined to place this main and most valuable result in the Constitution of the restored Union as one of its fundamental articles. Hence the thirteenth article of amendment of that instrument.</p>
<p id="fbc7a83e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To withdraw the mind from the contemplation of this grand yet simple declaration of the personal freedom of all the human race within the jurisdiction of this government—a declaration designed to establish the freedom of four millions of slaves—and with a microscopic search endeavor to find in it a reference to servitudes, which may have been attached to property in certain localities, requires an effort, to say the least of it.</p>
<p id="fbc7a83f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The word servitude is of larger meaning than slavery, as the latter is popularly understood in this country, and the obvious purpose was to forbid all shades and conditions of African slavery. It was very well understood that in the form of apprenticeship for long terms, as it had been practiced in the West India Islands, on the abolition of slavery by the English government, or by reducing the slaves to the condition of serfs attached to the plantation, the purpose of the article might have been evaded, if only the word slavery had been used. And it is all that we deem necessary to say on the application of that article to the statute of Louisiana, now under consideration.</p>

Among the first acts of legislation adopted by several of the States in the legislative bodies which claimed to be in their normal relations with the Federal government, were laws which imposed upon the colored race onerous disabilities and burdens, and curtailed their rights in the pursuit of life, liberty, and property to such an extent that their freedom was of little value, while they had lost the protection which they had received from their former owners from motives both of interest and humanity.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf51-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">They were in some States forbidden to appear in the towns in any other character than menial servants.

It is true that only the fifteenth amendment, in terms, mentions the negro by speaking of his color and his slavery. But it is just as true that each of the other articles was addressed to the grievances of that race, and designed to remedy them as the fifteenth.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not say that no one else but the negro can share in this protection. Both the language and spirit of these articles are to have their fair and just weight in any question of construction. Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language is, “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” It is a little remarkable, if this clause was intended as a protection to the citizen of a State against the legislative power of his own State, that the word citizen of the State should be left out when it is so carefully used, and used in contradistinction to citizens of the United States, in the very sentence which precedes it. It is too clear for argument that the change in phraseology was adopted understandingly and with a purpose.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the privileges and immunities of the citizen of the United States, and of the privileges and immunities of the citizen of the State, and what they respectively are, we will presently consider; but we wish to state here that it is only the former which are placed by this clause under the protection of the Federal Constitution, and that the latter, whatever they may be, are not intended to have any additional protection by this paragraph of the amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, then, there is a difference between the privileges and immunities belonging to a citizen of the United States as such, and those belonging to the citizen of the State as such the latter must rest for their security and protection where they have heretofore rested; for they are not embraced by this paragraph of the amendment.</p>

The first and the leading case on the subject is that of Corfield v. Coryell, decided by Mr. Justice Washington in the Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania in 1823. “The inquiry,” he says, “is, what are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States? We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are fundamental; which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several States which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign. What these fundamental principles are, it would be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may all, however, be comprehended under the following general heads: protection by the government, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety, subject, nevertheless, to such restraints as the government may prescribe for the general good of the whole.”</p>
<p id="fbc7cf58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he entire domain of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the States, as above defined, lay within the constitutional and legislative power of the States, and without that of the Federal government. Was it the purpose of the fourteenth amendment, by the simple declaration that no State should make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, to transfer the security and protection of all the civil rights which we have mentioned, from the States to the Federal government? And where it is declared that Congress shall have the power to enforce that article, was it intended to bring within the power of Congress the entire domain of civil rights heretofore belonging exclusively to the States?</p>
<p id="fbc7cf59-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All this and more must follow, if the proposition of the plaintiffs in error be sound. For not only are these rights subject to the control of Congress whenever in its discretion any of them are supposed to be abridged by State legislation, but that body may also pass laws in advance, limiting and restricting the exercise of legislative power by the States, in their most ordinary and usual functions, as in its judgment it may think proper on all such subjects. And still further, such a construction followed by the reversal of the judgments of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in these cases, would constitute this court a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States, on the civil rights of their own citizens, with authority to nullify such as it did not approve as consistent with those rights, as they existed at the time of the adoption of this amendment. But when, as in the case before us, these consequences are so serious, so far-reaching and pervading, so great a departure from the structure and spirit of our institutions; when the effect is to fetter and degrade the State governments by subjecting them to the control of Congress, in the exercise of powers heretofore universally conceded to them of the most ordinary and fundamental character; when in fact it radically changes the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people; the argument has a force that is irresistible, in the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are convinced that no such results were intended by the Congress which proposed these amendments, nor by the legislatures of the States which ratified them. Having shown that the privileges and immunities relied on in the argument are those which belong to citizens of the States as such, and that they are left to the State governments for security and protection, and not by this article placed under the special care of the Federal government, we may hold ourselves <span title="512" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-512">p. 512</span>excused from defining the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States which no State can abridge, until some case involving those privileges may make it necessary to do so.</p>
<p id="fbc7cf5b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But lest it should be said that no such privileges and immunities are to be found if those we have been considering are excluded, we venture to suggest some which owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws. One of these is well described in the case of Crandall v. Nevada. It is said to be the right of the citizen of this great country, protected by implied guarantees of its Constitution, “to come to the seat of government to assert any claim he may have upon that government, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection, to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions. He has the right of free access to its seaports, through which all operations of foreign commerce are conducted, to the subtreasuries, land offices, and courts of justice in the several States.” But it is useless to pursue this branch of the inquiry, since we are of opinion that the rights claimed by these plaintiffs in error, if they have any existence, are not privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States within the meaning of the clause of the fourteenth amendment under consideration.</p>
<p id="fbc7f66c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[<i>Due process</i>]: The argument has not been much pressed in these cases that the defendant’s charter deprives the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. We are not without judicial interpretation, therefore, both State and National, of the meaning of this clause. And it is sufficient to say that under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade by the butchers of New Orleans be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.</p>

The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be remedied by this clause, and by it such laws are forbidden.</p>
<p id="fbc7f66e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.

<p id="fbc7f670-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first clause of the fourteenth amendment recognizes in express terms, if it does not create, citizens of the United States, and it makes their citizenship dependent upon the place of their birth, or the fact of their adoption, and not upon the constitution or laws of any State or the condition of their ancestry. A citizen of a State is now only a citizen of the United States residing in that State. The fundamental rights, privileges, and immunities which belong to him as a free man and a free citizen, now belong to him as a citizen of the United States, and are not dependent upon his citizenship of any State. The exercise of these rights and privileges, and the degree of enjoyment received from such exercise, are always more or less affected by the condition and the local institutions of the <span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-513">p. 513</span>State, or city, or town where he resides. They are thus affected in a State by the wisdom of its laws, the ability of its officers, the efficiency of its magistrates, the education and morals of its people, and by many other considerations. This is a result which follows from the constitution of society, and can never be avoided, but in no other way can they be affected by the action of the State, or by the residence of the citizen therein. They do not derive their existence from its legislation, and cannot be destroyed by its power.</p>
<p id="fbc7f671-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The amendment does not attempt to confer any new privileges or immunities upon citizens, or to enumerate or define those already existing. It assumes that there are such privileges and immunities which belong of right to citizens as such, and ordains that they shall not be abridged by State legislation. If this inhibition has no reference to privileges and immunities of this character, but only refers, as held by the majority of the court in their opinion, to such privileges and immunities as were before its adoption specially designated in the Constitution or necessarily implied as belonging to citizens of the United States, it was a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage. With privileges and immunities thus designated or implied no State could ever have interfered by its laws, and no new constitutional provision was required to inhibit such interference. The supremacy of the Constitution and the laws of the United States always controlled any State legislation of that character. But if the amendment refers to the natural and inalienable rights which belong to all citizens, the inhibition has a profound significance and consequence.</p>

<p id="fbc7f672-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> narrowly interpreted each part of section one of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court’s narrow interpretation of the Due Process Clause was overruled relatively quickly. The Court rejected the application of the Due Process Clause to protect a right to practice one’s trade, with its declaration, without elaboration or explanation, that “it is sufficient to say that under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade by the butchers of New Orleans be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.” Yet, as presented in Chapter 6, by the late nineteenth century and in the first third of the twentieth century, the Court found that the Due Process Clause did protect a right to practice a person’s trade or profession. As presented in Chapter 8, throughout the twentieth century the Court has used the Due Process Clause to safeguard privacy and autonomy rights such as the right to marry, the right to custody of one’s children, the right to purchase and use contraceptives, and the right to abortion.</p>
<p id="fbc7f673-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s narrow interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause lasted until well into the twentieth century. The Court said that the Equal Protection Clause only was meant to protect blacks and offered the prediction that “[w]e doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.” This prediction obviously proved false, and the Equal Protection Clause has been applied to prevent discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, alienage, and legitimacy.</p>

The Court’s declaration that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was not meant to provide a basis for invalidating state and local laws precluded the use of that provision to apply the Bill of Rights to the states. Indeed, the Court was explicit that “privileges and immunities . . . are left to the State governments for security and protection, and not by this article placed under the special care of the federal government.” This means that the Privileges or Immunities Clause is removed as a basis for applying the Bill of Rights to the states or for protecting any rights from state interference.</p>

<p id="fbc81d92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. The scheme limits the amount payable to a family that has resided in the State for less than 12 months to the amount payable by the State of the family’s prior residence.</p>
<p id="fbc81d93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is at issue in this case is the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State. That right is protected not only by the new arrival’s status as a state citizen, but also by her status as a citizen of the United States. That additional source of protection <span title="515" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-515">p. 515</span>is plainly identified in the opening words of the Fourteenth Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. . . .”</p>
<p id="fbc843a4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel. Writing for the majority in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges conferred by this Clause “is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State.”</p>
<p id="fbc843a5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That newly arrived citizens “have two political capacities, one state and one federal,” adds special force to their claim that they have the same rights as others who share their citizenship. Neither mere rationality nor some intermediate standard of review should be used to judge the constitutionality of a state rule that discriminates against some of its citizens because they have been domiciled in the State for less than a year.</p>
<p id="fbc843a6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because this case involves discrimination against citizens who have completed their interstate travel, the State’s argument that its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only “incidentally” is beside the point. Were we concerned solely with actual deterrence to migration, we might be persuaded that a partial withholding of benefits constitutes a lesser incursion on the right to travel than an outright denial of all benefits. But since the right to travel embraces the citizen’s right to be treated equally in her new State of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a penalty.</p>
<p id="fbc843a7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These classifications may not be justified by a purpose to deter welfare applicants from migrating to California. First, although it is reasonable to assume that some persons may be motivated to move for the purpose of obtaining higher benefits, the empirical evidence reviewed by the District Judge, which takes into account the high cost of living in California, indicates that the number of such persons is quite small—surely not large enough to justify a burden on those who had no such motive. Second, California has represented to the Court that the legislation was not enacted for any such reason.</p>

<p id="fbc843a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today breathes new life into the previously dormant Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—a Clause relied upon by this Court in only one other decision, Colgate v. Harvey (1935), overruled five years later by Madden v. Kentucky (1940). It uses this Clause to strike down what I believe is a reasonable measure falling under the head of a “good-faith residency requirement.” Because I do not think any provision of the Constitution—and surely not a provision relied upon for only the second time since its enactment 130 years ago—requires this result, I dissent.</p>
<p id="fbc843aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas,</span> with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbc843ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write separately to address the majority’s conclusion that California has violated “the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities <span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>enjoyed by other citizens of the same State.” In my view, the majority attributes a meaning to the Privileges or Immunities Clause that likely was unintended when the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted and ratified.</p>
<p id="fbc843ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t comes as quite a surprise that the majority relies on the Privileges or Immunities Clause at all in this case. That is because the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> sapped the Clause of any meaning. Although the majority appears to breathe new life into the Clause today, it fails to address its historical underpinnings or its place in our constitutional jurisprudence.</p>
<p id="fbc843ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I believe that the demise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause has contributed in no small part to the current disarray of our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, I would be open to reevaluating its meaning in an appropriate case. Before invoking the Clause, however, we should endeavor to understand what the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought that it meant. We should also consider whether the Clause should displace, rather than augment, portions of our equal protection and substantive due process jurisprudence. The majority’s failure to consider these important questions raises the specter that the Privileges or Immunities Clause will become yet another convenient tool for inventing new rights, limited solely by the “predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court.” Moore v. East Cleveland (1977).</p>

<p id="fbc86ac0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i>, the application of the Bill of Rights to the states could not be through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. In the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court suggested an alternate approach: finding that at least some of the Bill of Rights provisions are part of the liberty protected from state interference by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc86ac1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1897, in Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897), the Supreme Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from taking property without just compensation. Although the Court did not speak explicitly of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporating the Takings Clause, that was the practical effect of the decision.</p>
<p id="fbc86ac2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), the Supreme Court first expressly discussed applying the Bill of Rights to the states through the process of finding a right to be “incorporated” into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Twining</i> involved whether a jury in state court could be instructed that it could draw a negative inference against a criminal defendant who did not testify. The Court had previously ruled that this violated the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination. The issue was whether this right applied in state court.</p>
<p id="fbc86ac3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court held that it did not (something later reversed), but the Court said that “it is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against national action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. If this is so, it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.”</p>
<p id="fbc86ac4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="517" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-517">p. 517</span>The Court then considered how to determine whether a right is included in due process of law: “What is due process of law may be ascertained by an examination of those settled usages and modes of proceedings existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors, and shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country.”</p>
<p id="fbc86ac5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination was not incorporated into due process (a holding that was later reversed): “We inquire whether the exemption from self-incrimination is of such a nature that it must be included in the conception of due process. Is it a fundamental principle of liberty and justice which inheres in the very idea of free government and is the inalienable right of a citizen of such a government? If it is, and if it is of a nature that pertains to process of law, this court has declared it to be essential to due process of law. Even if the historical meaning of due process of law and the decisions of this court did not exclude the privilege from it, it would be going far to rate it as an immutable principle of justice which is the inalienable possession of every citizen of a free government. Salutary as the principle may seem to the great majority, it cannot be ranked with the right to hearing before condemnation, the immunity from arbitrary power not acting by general laws, and the inviolability of private property.”</p>
<p id="fbc86ac6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Twining</i> expressly opened the door to the Supreme Court applying provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states by finding them to be included—-incorporated—into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Soon the Court began to use this door. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), the Court for the first time said that the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech applies to the states through its incorporation into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court declared, “For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press—which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress—are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.” In <i>Gitlow</i>, the Court actually rejected the constitutional challenge to a state law that made it a crime to advocate the violent overthrow of government by force or violence. Two years later, in Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927), the Court for the first time found that a state law regulating speech violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc86ac7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1933, in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), the Court found that a state’s denial of counsel in a capital case denied due process, thereby in essence applying the Sixth Amendment to the states in capital cases. The infamous Scottsboro trial involved two African American men who were convicted of rape without the assistance of an attorney at trial and with a jury from which all blacks had been excluded. The Supreme Court concluded that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects fundamental rights from state interference and that this can include Bill of Rights provisions. But the Court said that “[i]f this is so, it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included in the ‘conception of due process of law.’” The Court held that in a capital case, “it [is] clear that the right to the aid of counsel is of this fundamental character.”</p><span title="518" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-518">p. 518</span>

<p id="fbc86aca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the Court found that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected fundamental rights from state infringement, there was a major debate over which liberties are safeguarded. For many years, this debate raged among justices and commentators. On the one side, there were the total incorporationists who believed that all of the Bill of Rights should be deemed to be included in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justices Black and Douglas were the foremost advocates of this position.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102BA_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N102BA_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc891dc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side, there were the selective incorporationists who believed that only some of the Bill of Rights were sufficiently fundamental to apply to state and local governments. Justice Cardozo, for example, wrote that “[t]he process of absorption . . . [applied to rights where] neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C8_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N102C8_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> Justice Cardozo said that the Due Process Clause included “principles of justice so rooted in the tradition and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental” and that were therefore “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102CE_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N102CE_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span> Justice Frankfurter said that due process precludes those practices that “offend those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102D6_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N102D6_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">16</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc891e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The debate between total and selective incorporation was obviously extremely important because it determined the reach of the Bill of Rights and the extent to which individuals could turn to the federal courts for protection from state and local governments.

<p id="fbc891e3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A statute of Connecticut permitting appeals in criminal cases to be taken by the state is challenged by appellant as an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="fbc891e4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument for appellant is that whatever is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment is forbidden by the Fourteenth also. The Fifth Amendment, which is not directed to the States, but solely to the federal government, creates immunity from double jeopardy. No person shall be “subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The Fourteenth Amendment ordains, “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” To retry a defendant, though under one indictment and only one, subjects him, it is said, to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the United States. From this the consequence is said to follow that there is a denial of life or liberty without due process of law, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the people of a state.</p>
<p id="fbc8b8f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have said that in appellant’s view the Fourteenth Amendment is to be taken as embodying the prohibitions of the Fifth. His thesis is even broader. Whatever would be a violation of the original bill of rights (Amendments 1 to 8) if done by the federal government is now equally unlawful by force of the <span title="519" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-519">p. 519</span>Fourteenth Amendment if done by a state. There is no such general rule. The Fifth Amendment provides, among other things, that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury. This court has held that, in prosecutions by a state, presentment or indictment by a grand jury may give way to informations at the instance of a public officer. Hurtado v. California (1884). This court has ruled that consistently with those amendments trial by jury may be modified by a state or abolished altogether.</p>
<p id="fbc8b8f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a “principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them.</p>
<p id="fbc8b8f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is [allowing the State to appeal the] kind of double jeopardy to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so acute and shocking that our policy will not endure it? Does it violate those “fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions”? The answer surely must be “no.” There is here no seismic innovation. The edifice of justice stands. The conviction of appellant is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen of the United States.</p>

The provisions of California law permit the failure of a defendant to explain or to deny evidence against him to be commented upon by court and by counsel and to be considered by court and jury. The defendant did not testify. As the trial court gave its instructions and the District Attorney argued the case in accordance with the constitutional and statutory provisions just referred to, we have for decision the question of their constitutionality in these circumstances under the limitations of §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc8b8fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is settled law that the clause of the Fifth Amendment, protecting a person against being compelled to be a witness against himself, is not made effective by the Fourteenth Amendment as a protection against state action on the ground that freedom from testimonial compulsion is a right of national citizenship, or because it is a personal privilege or immunity secured by the Federal Constitution as one of the rights of man that are listed in the Bill of Rights. The reasoning that leads to those conclusions starts with the unquestioned premise that the Bill of Rights, when adopted, was for the protection of the individual against the federal government and its provisions were inapplicable to similar actions done by the states.</p>

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, does not draw all the rights of the federal Bill of Rights under its protection. That contention was made and rejected in Palko v.

It forbids any other type of coercion that falls within the scope of due process. California follows Anglo-American legal tradition in excusing defendants in criminal prosecutions from compulsory testimony. So our inquiry is directed, not at the broad question of the constitutionality of compulsory testimony from the accused under the Due Process Clause, but to the constitutionality of the provision of the California law that permits comment upon his failure to testify.</p>
<p id="fbc8b8fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of due process is not to protect an accused against a proper conviction but against an unfair conviction. When evidence is before a jury that threatens conviction, it does not seem unfair to require him to choose between leaving the adverse evidence unexplained and subjecting himself to impeachment through disclosure of former crimes. Indeed, this is a dilemma with which any defendant may be faced. If facts, adverse to the defendant, are proven by the prosecution, there may be no way to explain them favorably to the accused except by a witness who may be vulnerable to impeachment on cross-examination. The defendant must then decide whether or not to use such a witness. The fact that the witness may also be the defendant makes the choice more difficult but a denial of due process does not emerge from the circumstances.</p>

It is so, of course, by explicit act of Congress. But to suggest that such a limitation can be drawn out of “due process” in its protection of ultimate decency in a civilized society is to suggest that the Due Process Clause fastened fetters of unreason upon the States.</p>
<p id="fbc8b901-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between the incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Constitution and the beginning of the present membership of the Court—a period of 70 years—the scope of that Amendment was passed upon by 43 judges. Of all these judges, only one, who may respectfully be called an eccentric exception, ever indicated the belief that the Fourteenth Amendment was a shorthand summary of the first eight Amendments theretofore limiting only the Federal Government, and that due process incorporated those eight Amendments as restrictions upon the powers of the States. Among these judges were not only those who would have to be included among the greatest in the history of the Court, but—it is especially relevant to note—they included those whose services in the cause of human rights and the spirit of freedom are the most conspicuous in our history. It is not invidious to single out Miller, Davis, Bradley, Waite, Matthews, Gray, Fuller, Holmes, Brandeis, Stone and Cardozo (to speak only of the dead) as judges who were alert in safeguarding and promoting the interests of liberty and human dignity through law. But they were also judges mindful of the relation of our federal system to a progressively democratic society and therefore duly regardful of the scope of authority that was left to the States even after the Civil War.</p>

With full knowledge of the import of the <i>Barron</i> decision, the framers and backers of the Fourteenth Amendment proclaimed its purpose to be to overturn the constitutional rule that case had announced.

<p id="fbc8e019-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The debate over incorporation centered primarily on three issues. First, the debate was over history and whether the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended it to apply the Bill of Rights to the states. Both sides of the debate claimed that history supported their view.</p>
<p id="fbc8e01a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the incorporation debate was over federalism. Applying the Bill of Rights to the states imposes a substantial set of restrictions on state and local governments. Not surprisingly, opponents of total incorporation argued based on federalism: the desirability of preserving state and local governing autonomy by freeing state and local governments from application of the Bill of Rights. Defenders of total incorporation responded that federalism is not a sufficient reason for tolerating violations of fundamental liberties.</p>
<p id="fbc8e01b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the debate was over the appropriate judicial role. In contrast, advocates of selective incorporation denied that this allowed subjective choices by justices. They maintained that total incorporation would mean more judicial oversight of state and local actions and thus less room for democracy to operate.</p>

<p id="fbc8e01e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The selective incorporationists prevailed in this debate in that the Supreme Court never has accepted the total incorporationist approach. However, from a practical perspective, the total incorporationists largely succeeded in their objective because, one by one, the Supreme Court found almost all of the provisions to be incorporated.</p>
<p id="fbc9072f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury applies to the states. Justice Byron White wrote for the Court and summarized the development of the law:</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbc90730-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In resolving conflicting claims concerning the meaning of this spacious language, the Court has looked increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution have been held to be protected against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That clause now protects the right to compensation for property taken by the State, Chicago, B. &amp; Q.R. Co. v. City of Chicago (1897); the rights of speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment, see, e.g., Fiske v. State of Kansas (1927); the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized, Mapp v. State of Ohio (1961); the right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination, Malloy v. Hogan (1964); and the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright (1963); to a speedy, Klopfer v. State of North Carolina (1967), and public trial, In re Oliver (1948); to confrontation of opposing witnesses, Pointer v. State of Texas (1965); and to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, Washington v. State of Texas (1967).</p>
<p id="fbc90731-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those “fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,” Powell v. State of Alabama, (1932); whether it is “basic in our system of jurisprudence,” In re Oliver (1948); and whether it is “a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,” Gideon v. Wainwright (1963).</p>
<p id="fbc90732-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests.  The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered. A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power—a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence. The deep commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law enforcement qualifies <span title="523" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-523">p. 523</span>for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must therefore be respected by the States.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbc90734-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My view has been and is that the Fourteenth Amendment, as a whole, makes the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. This would certainly include the language of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause. I can say only that the words “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States. What more precious “privilege” of American citizenship could there be than that privilege to claim the protections of our great Bill of Rights? I suggest that any reading of “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” which excludes the Bill of Rights’ safeguards renders the words of this section of the Fourteenth Amendment meaningless. Senator Howard, who introduced the Fourteenth Amendment for passage in the Senate, certainly read the words this way.</p>

<p id="fbc90735-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the last decade, the Court has twice considered incorporation. In McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), the Court considered the incorporation of the Second Amendment. And in Timbs v.

<p id="fbc90736-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) (presented in Chapter 1), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment is not limited to protecting a right to have firearms for militia service; it protects an individual’s right to have guns, at least for self-protection in the home. Because the District of Columbia is a part of the federal government, the Court had no occasion to consider whether the Second Amendment applies to state and local governments. In <i>McDonald</i>, the Court addressed this and held five to four that the Second Amendment applies to state and local governments. Justice Alito, writing for a plurality of four, used incorporation into the Due Process Clause to accomplish this. Justice Thomas, concurring and concurring in the judgment, would have used the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbc92e53-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained, we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to <i>our</i> scheme of ordered liberty, or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”</p>
<p id="fbc92e54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision in <i>Heller</i> points unmistakably to the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day, and in <i>Heller,</i> we held that individual self-defense is “the <i>central component</i>” of the Second Amendment right. Explaining that “the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute” in the home, we found that this right applies to handguns because they are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family.” Thus, we concluded, citizens must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.”</p>
<p id="fbc95565-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Heller</i> makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” <i>Heller</i> explored the right’s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self-defense, and that by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was “one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.” Blackstone’s assessment was shared by the American colonists. As we noted in <i>Heller</i>, King George III’s attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760’s and 1770’s “provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.”</p>
<p id="fbc95566-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p id="fbc95567-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of Rights. In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820.</p>
<p id="fbc95568-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African Americans who served in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confederacy, where systematic <span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-525">p. 525</span>efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks. The laws of some States formally prohibited African Americans from possessing firearms. Union Army commanders took steps to secure the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms, but the 39th Congress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental. The Civil Rights Act of 1866, which was considered at the same time as the Freedmen’s Bureau Act, sought to protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p id="fbc95569-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Samuel Pomeroy described three “indispensable” “safeguards of liberty under our form of Government.” One of these, he said, was the right to keep and bear arms. Even those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment unnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, “have equal right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for self-defense.” Evidence from the period immediately following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms that the right to keep and bear arms was considered fundamental.</p>
<p id="fbc9556a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.</p>

<p id="fbc9556c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in <i>Heller</i>: that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in <i>Heller</i> as a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="fbc9556d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Municipal respondents submit that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights “recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of [their] justice.” According to municipal respondents, if it is possible to imagine <i>any</i> civilized legal system that does not recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause does not make that right binding on the States. Therefore, the municipal respondents continue, because such countries as England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc9556e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases. And the present-day implications of municipal respondents’ argument are stunning. For example, many of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this country. If <i>our</i> understanding of the right to a jury trial, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to counsel were necessary attributes of <i>any</i> civilized country, it would follow that the United States is the only civilized Nation in the world.</p>
<p id="fbc9556f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Heller</i>, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense.

But I cannot agree that it is enforceable against the States through a clause that speaks only to “process.” Instead, the right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of American citizenship that applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause.</p>
<p id="fbc97c84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The meaning of §1’s next sentence has divided this Court for many years. That sentence begins with the command that “[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” On its face, this appears to grant the persons just made United States citizens a certain collection of rights—i.e., privileges or immunities—attributable to that status.</p>
<p id="fbc97c85-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only “process” before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a particularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the Court’s substantive due process precedents together is their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish “fundamental” rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not. Today’s decision illustrates the point.</p>
<p id="fbc97c86-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, the plurality’s effort to cabin the exercise of judicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focusing its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American history and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse than the alternatives. But any serious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause must acknowledge that neither its text nor its history suggests that it protects the many substantive rights this Court’s cases now claim it does.</p>
<p id="fbc97c87-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation that rests on such tenuous footing. This Court’s substantive due process framework fails to account for both the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that led to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alternative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this Court to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is designed to protect with greater clarity and predictability than the substantive due process framework has so far managed.</p>
<p id="fbc97c88-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="527" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-527">p. 527</span>I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been built upon the substantive due process framework, and I further acknowledge the importance of <i>stare decisis</i> to the stability of our Nation’s legal system. But <i>stare decisis</i> is only an “adjunct” of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means. Moreover, as judges, we interpret the Constitution one case or controversy at a time. The question presented in this case is not whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, but only whether, and to what extent, a particular clause in the Constitution protects the particular right at issue here. With the inquiry appropriately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity to reexamine, and begin the process of restoring, the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment agreed upon by those who ratified it.</p>
<p id="fbc97c89-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that the Second Amendment is fully applicable to the States. I do so because the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment as a privilege of American citizenship.</p>
<p id="fbc97c8a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stevens</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbc97c8b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court answered the question whether a federal enclave’s “prohibition on the possession of usable handguns in the home violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution.” The question we should be answering in this case is whether the Constitution “guarantees individuals a fundamental right,” enforceable against the States, “to possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.” That is a different—and more difficult—inquiry than asking if the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporates” the Second Amendment. The so-called incorporation question was squarely and, in my view, correctly resolved in the late 19th century.</p>
<p id="fbc97c8c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the plurality’s refusal to accept petitioners’ primary submission. Their briefs marshal an impressive amount of historical evidence for their argument that the Court interpreted the Privileges or Immunities Clause too narrowly in the <i>Slaughter-House Cases</i> (1873). But the original meaning of the Clause is not as clear as they suggest—and not nearly as clear as it would need to be to dislodge 137 years of precedent. The burden is severe for those who seek radical change in such an established body of constitutional doctrine. Moreover, the suggestion that invigorating the Privileges or Immunities Clause will reduce judicial discretion, strikes me as implausible, if not exactly backwards. “For the very reason that it has so long remained a clean slate, a revitalized Privileges or Immunities Clause holds special hazards for judges who are mindful that their proper task is not to write their personal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbc97c8d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in this case, then, is not whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever that right’s precise contours) applies to the States because the Amendment has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. It has not been. The question, rather, is whether the particular right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to answer that question, we need to determine, first, the nature of the right that has been asserted and, second, whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment “liberty.” Even accepting the Court’s holding in <i>Heller</i>, it remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear arms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable against the States, or that only part of the right is so enforceable. It is likewise <span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-528">p. 528</span>possible for the Court to find in this case that some part of the <i>Heller</i> right applies to the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.</p>
<p id="fbc97c8e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners defend their families and property from intruders, they can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of our communities. <i>Amici</i> calculate that approximately one million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire in the last decade. Urban areas such as Chicago suffer disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Handguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals will value them for the same reasons. In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of all murders nationwide.</p>
<p id="fbc97c8f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides of the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to destabilize ordered liberty. <i>Your</i> interest in keeping and bearing a certain firearm may diminish <i>my</i> interest in being and feeling safe from armed violence. And while granting you the right to own a handgun might make you safer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contribution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mischief—it may make you and the community you live in less safe overall, owing to the increased number of handguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democratically elected legislature to take such concerns into account in considering what sorts of regulations would best serve the public welfare.</p>
<p id="fbc97c90-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing is different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-<i>Lochner</i> century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty” encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imperfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their <i>amici</i> make such a contention.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the experience of other advanced democracies, including those that share our British heritage, undercuts the notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms is intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries place restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of firearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in this Nation. That the United States is an international outlier in the permissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that our laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court may not need to assume responsibility for making our laws still more permissive.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3a2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in many relevant respects, including their problems with violent crime and the traditional role that firearms <span title="529" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-529">p. 529</span>have played in their societies. But they are not so different from the United States that we ought to dismiss their experience entirely. The fact that our oldest allies have almost uniformly found it appropriate to regulate firearms extensively tends to weaken petitioners’ submission that the right to possess a gun of one’s choosing is fundamental to a life of liberty. While the “American perspective” must always be our focus, it is silly—indeed, arrogant—to think we have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of people beyond our borders.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3a3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, and critically, the Court’s imposition of a national standard is still more unwise because the elected branches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of safeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms. The strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in connection with its status in the democratic process. And in this case, no one disputes “that opponents of [gun] control have considerable political power and do not seem to be at a systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,” or that “the widespread commitment to an individual right to own guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or unjustified gun control laws.” Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers tend to <i>under</i> regulate guns, relative to the policy views expressed by majorities in opinion polls. If a particular State or locality has enacted some “improvident” gun-control measures, as petitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent reason to infer that the mistake will not “eventually be rectified by the democratic process.”</p>

<p id="fbc9a3a9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tyson Timbs pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit theft. The trial court sentenced him to one year of home detention and five years of probation, which included a court-supervised addiction-treatment program. The sentence also required Timbs to pay fees and costs totaling $1,203. At the time of Timbs’s arrest, the police seized his vehicle, a Land Rover SUV Timbs had purchased for about $42,000. Timbs paid for the vehicle with money he received from an insurance policy when his father died.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State engaged a private law firm to bring a civil suit for forfeiture of Timbs’s Land Rover, charging that the vehicle had been used to transport heroin. After Timbs’s guilty plea in the criminal case, the trial court held a hearing on the forfeiture demand. Although finding that Timbs’s vehicle had been used to facilitate violation of a criminal statute, the court denied the requested forfeiture, observing that Timbs had recently purchased the vehicle for $42,000, more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for his drug conviction. Forfeiture of the Land Rover, the court determined, would be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of Timbs’s offense, hence unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. The Court of Appeals of Indiana affirmed that determination, but the Indiana Supreme Court reversed.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented: Is the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause an “incorporated” protection applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause? Like the Eighth Amendment’s proscriptions <span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-530">p. 530</span>of “cruel and unusual punishment” and “[e]xcessive bail,” the protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government’s punitive or criminal-law-enforcement authority. This safeguard, we hold, is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,” with “dee[p] root[s] in [our] history and tradition.” The Excessive Fines Clause is therefore incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbc9a3ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Excessive Fines Clause traces its venerable lineage back to at least 1215, when Magna Carta guaranteed that “[a] Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after the greatness thereof, saving to him his contenement. . . .” As relevant here, Magna Carta required that economic sanctions “be proportioned to the wrong” and “not be so large as to deprive [an offender] of his livelihood.”</p>
<p id="fbc9a3ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite Magna Carta, imposition of excessive fines persisted. The 17th century Stuart kings, in particular, were criticized for using large fines to raise revenue, harass their political foes, and indefinitely detain those unable to pay. When James II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, the attendant English Bill of Rights reaffirmed Magna Carta’s guarantee by providing that “excessive Bail ought not to be required, nor excessive Fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted.”</p>
<p id="fbc9a3af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Across the Atlantic, this familiar language was adopted almost verbatim, first in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, then in the Eighth Amendment, which states: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”</p>
<p id="fbc9cac0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adoption of the Excessive Fines Clause was in tune not only with English law; the Clause resonated as well with similar colonial-era provisions.</p>
<p id="fbc9cac1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An even broader consensus obtained in 1868 upon ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. By then, the constitutions of 35 of the 37 States—accounting for over 90% of the U.S. population—expressly prohibited excessive fines. Today, acknowledgment of the right’s fundamental nature remains widespread. As Indiana itself reports, all 50 States have a constitutional provision prohibiting the imposition of excessive fines either directly or by requiring proportionality.</p>
<p id="fbc9cac2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties. Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies, as the Stuarts’ critics learned several centuries ago. Even absent a political motive, fines may be employed “in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence,” for “fines are a source of revenue,” while other forms of punishment “cost a State money.”</p>
<p id="fbc9cac3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the historical and logical case for concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is overwhelming. Protection against excessive punitive economic sanctions secured by the Clause is, to repeat, both “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”</p>
<p id="fbc9cac4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fbc9cac5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on excessive fines fully applicable to the States. But I cannot agree with the route the Court takes to reach this conclusion. Instead of reading the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause to encompass a <span title="531" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-531">p. 531</span>substantive right that has nothing to do with “process,” I would hold that the right to be free from excessive fines is one of the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbc9cac6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>McDonald</i> and <i>Timbs</i>, there are still three provisions of the Bill of Rights that never have been incorporated and do not apply to state and local governments. First, the Third Amendment right to not have soldiers quartered in a person’s home never has been deemed incorporated. The reason almost certainly is that a Third Amendment case presenting the incorporation question never has reached the Supreme Court. If ever such a case would arise, the Supreme Court surely would find this provision applies to the states.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10547_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10547_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">18</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc9cac8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court has held that the Fifth Amendment’s right to a grand jury indictment in criminal cases is not incorporated.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10552_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10552_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> Thus, states need not use grand juries and can choose alternatives such as preliminary hearings and prosecutorial informations.</p>
<p id="fbc9caca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court has ruled that the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases is not incorporated.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1055C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1055C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">20</a></span> States therefore can eliminate juries in some or even all civil suits without violating the United States Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbc9cacc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remainder of the Bill of Rights, as detailed above, has been deemed incorporated. Technically, the Bill of Rights still applies directly only to the federal government; Barron v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore never has been expressly overruled. Therefore, whenever a case involves a state or local violation of a Bill of Rights provision, to be precise, it involves that provision as applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbc9f1df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the states, is its content identical as to when it is applied to the federal government?

<p id="fbc9f1e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has not consistently answered these questions. In some cases, the Court has expressly stated that the Bill of Rights provision applied in exactly the same manner whether it is a federal or a state government action. For example, the Supreme Court has declared that it is “firmly embedded in our constitutional jurisprudence . . . that the several States have no greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the First Amendment than does the Congress of the United States.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10582_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10582_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> Similarly, the Court has said <span title="532" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-532">p. 532</span>that “the guarantees of the First Amendment, the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures of the Fourth Amendment, and the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, are all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10593_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10593_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span> The Court said that it “rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states only a ‘watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.’”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10599_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10599_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">24</a></span></p>
<p id="fbc9f1e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in other instances, the Court has ruled that some Bill of Rights provisions apply differently to the states than to the federal government. In Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Supreme Court held that states need not use 12-person juries in criminal cases, even though that is the practice for federal trials. The Court upheld the constitutionality of six-person juries in state criminal trials and explained that the jury of 12 was “a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system.”</p>
<p id="fbc9f1e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), and Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356 (1972), the Supreme Court held that states may allow non-unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases. Although the Sixth Amendment has been interpreted to require unanimous juries in federal criminal trials, the Supreme Court ruled that states may allow convictions based on 11-1 or 10-2 jury votes. However, the Court has ruled that conviction by a nonunanimous six-person jury violates due process.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105A8_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N105A8_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">25</a></span> In Ramos v.

<p id="fbc9f1e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From a practical perspective, except for the requirements of a 12-person jury and a unanimous verdict, the Bill of Rights provisions that have been incorporated apply to the states exactly as they apply to the federal government. This might be criticized on federalism grounds as unduly limiting the states. But rights such as freedom of speech are fundamental liberties and there is no reason why their content should vary depending on the level of government.</p>
<p id="fbc9f1e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the debate over incorporation raged among Justices and scholars during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, now the issue seems settled. Except for the few provisions mentioned above, the Bill of Rights provisions do apply to state and local governments and, in almost all instances, with the same content regardless of whether the challenge is a challenge to federal, state, or local actions.</p>

<p id="fbca18fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution’s protections of individual liberties and its requirement for equal protection apply only to the government. Private conduct generally does not have to comply with the Constitution.

The Constitution applies to government at all levels, federal, state, and local, and to the actions of government officers at all levels. The Constitution, however, generally does not apply to private entities or actors.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbca1906-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1. That all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude.</p>
<p id="fbca1907-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sec. 2. That any person who shall violate the foregoing section by denying to any citizen, except for reasons by law applicable to citizens of every race and color, and regardless of any previous condition of servitude, the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges in said section enumerated, or by aiding or inciting such denial, shall, for every such offense, forfeit and pay the sum of $500 to the person aggrieved thereby, to be recovered in an action of debt, with full costs; and shall, also, for every such offense, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than $500 nor more than $1,000, or shall be imprisoned not less than 30 days nor more than one year.</p>
</div>

<p id="fbca1908-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two of the cases, those against Stanley and Nichols, are indictments for denying to persons of color the accommodations and privileges of an inn or hotel; two of them, those against Ryan and Singleton, are, one an information, the other an indictment, for denying to individuals the privileges and accommodations of a theater, the information against Ryan being for refusing a colored person a seat in the dress circle of Maguire’s theater in San Francisco; and the indictment against Singleton being for denying to another person, whose color is not stated, the full enjoyment of the accommodations of the theater known as the Grand Opera House in New York, “said denial not being made for any reasons by law applicable to citizens of every race and color, and regardless of any previous condition of servitude.”</p>
<p id="fbca1909-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Has congress constitutional power to make such a law? Of course, no one will contend that the power to pass it was contained in the constitution before the adoption of the last three amendments. The first section of the fourteenth amendment,—which is the one relied on,—after declaring who shall be citizens of the United States, and of the several states, is prohibitory in its character, and prohibitory upon the states. It is state action of a particular character that is <span title="534" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-534">p. 534</span>prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the amendment.</p>
<p id="fbca190a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he last section of the amendment invests congress with power to enforce it by appropriate legislation. To enforce what? To enforce the prohibition. To adopt appropriate legislation for correcting the effects of such prohibited state law and state acts, and thus to render them effectually null, void, and innocuous. This is the legislative power conferred upon congress, and this is the whole of it. It does not invest congress with power to legislate upon subjects which are within the domain of state legislation; but to provide modes of relief against state legislation, or state action, of the kind referred to. It does not authorize congress to create a code of municipal law for the regulation of private rights; but to provide modes of redress against the operation of state laws, and the action of state officers, executive or judicial, when these are subversive of the fundamental rights specified in the amendment. Positive rights and privileges are undoubtedly secured by the fourteenth amendment; but they are secured by way of prohibition against state laws and state proceedings affecting those rights and privileges, and by power given to congress to legislate for the purpose of carrying such prohibition into effect; and such legislation must necessarily be predicated upon such supposed state laws or state proceedings, and be directed to the correction of their operation and effect.</p>
<p id="fbca401b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And so in the present case, until some state law has been passed, or some state action through its officers or agents has been taken, adverse to the rights of citizens sought to be protected by the fourteenth amendment, no legislation of the United States under said amendment, nor any proceeding under such legislation, can be called into activity, for the prohibitions of the amendment are against state laws and acts done under state authority.</p>
<p id="fbca401c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An inspection of the law shows that it makes no reference whatever to any supposed or apprehended violation of the fourteenth amendment on the part of the states. It is not predicated on any such view. It does not profess to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committed by the states; it does not make its operation to depend upon any such wrong committed. In other words, it steps into the domain of local jurisprudence, and lays down rules for the conduct of individuals in society towards each other, and imposes sanctions for the enforcement of those rules, without referring in any manner to any supposed action of the state or its authorities. If this legislation is appropriate for enforcing the prohibitions of the amendment, it is difficult to see where it is to stop.</p>

<p id="fbca401e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion in these cases proceeds, as it seems to me, upon grounds entirely too narrow and artificial. The substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism. “It is not the words of the law but the internal sense of it that makes the law. The letter of the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul.” Constitutional provisions, adopted in the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, if need be, rights inhering in a state of freedom, and belonging to American citizenship, have been so construed as to defeat the ends the people desired to accomplish, which they attempted to accomplish, and which they supposed they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental law. By this I do not mean that the determination of these cases should have been materially controlled by considerations <span title="535" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-535">p. 535</span>of mere expediency or policy. I mean only, in this form, to express an earnest conviction that the court has departed from the familiar rule requiring, in the interpretation of constitutional provisions, that full effect be given to the intent with which they were adopted.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="fbca401f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The blanket rule that the Constitution only applies to the government must be qualified in a few respects. First, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution is the one provision that directly regulates private conduct. Section 1 of the Thirteenth Amendment states, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” In other words, the Thirteenth Amendment forbids people from being or owning slaves. For example, the Supreme Court has said that the Thirteenth Amendment forbids compelling a person to work for another individual to repay a debt.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1062D_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1062D_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span></p>
<p id="fbca4021-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, statutes, both federal and state, can apply constitutional norms to private conduct. The state action doctrine provides that the Constitution only applies to the government. But the government can enact laws that require that private conduct meet the same standards that the Constitution requires of the government. For example, the constitutional requirement for equal protection applies just to the government. Congress, however, has enacted laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that prohibit private discrimination by private employers and by places of public accommodation.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1063C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1063C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">27</a></span> Another illustration is a California law that requires that private schools and universities provide the same protection of speech that students would receive at a public school or university.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10642_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10642_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">28</a></span> Actions, of course, are brought directly under such statutes and are governed by the terms of the laws; the Constitution still does not apply.</p>
<p id="fbca4024-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, there are exceptions to the state action requirement; situations where private conduct has to comply with the Constitution. These exceptions are presented in detail below.</p>
<p id="fbca4025-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In evaluating the Supreme Court cases below that concern the exceptions to the state action doctrine, it is important to consider the costs and benefits of having such a rule. Obviously, those who believe that the disadvantages of the state action doctrine outweigh its advantages want broad exceptions to the doctrine and those who think the reverse want very narrow exceptions.</p>
<p id="fbca4026-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="536" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-536">p. 536</span>There are serious costs to the state action requirement: Absent statutory restrictions, private conduct can infringe or trample even the most basic rights. Freedom of speech, privacy, and equality—this society’s most cherished values—can be violated without any redress in the courts. Private infringements of basic freedoms can be just as harmful as government violations. Speech can be lost or chilled just as much through private sanctions as through public ones. Private discrimination causes and perpetuates social inequalities at least as pernicious as those caused by government actions.</p>
<p id="fbca6737-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the state action doctrine is defended as desirable on the grounds that it preserves a zone of private autonomy and that it advances federalism. The Supreme Court has explained that the state action requirement “preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1065C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1065C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span> The state action doctrine means that private actors have the freedom to ignore the Constitution and the limits contained within it. A vast array of private actions might be constrained and challenged in the courts if there were not a state action requirement for the application of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbca6739-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, the Supreme Court says that the state action doctrine enhances federalism by preserving a zone of state sovereignty.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10666_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10666_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">30</a></span> The <i>Civil Rights Cases</i> held that federal constitutional rights do not govern individual behavior and, furthermore, that Congress lacks the authority to apply them to private conduct.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10671_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10671_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">31</a></span> Structuring the legal relationships of private citizens was for the state, not for the national government.</p>
<p id="fbca673c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering the exceptions to the state action doctrine, it is important to consider these competing policy considerations in evaluating whether the Court has properly defined the exceptions or whether they are too broad or too narrow.</p>

<p id="fbca673f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two exceptions to the state action doctrine; that is, situations where private conduct must comply with the Constitution. One is the “public functions exception,” which says that a private entity must comply with the Constitution if it is performing a task that has been traditionally, exclusively done by the government. The other is the “entanglement exception,” which says that private conduct must comply with the Constitution if the government has authorized, encouraged, or facilitated the unconstitutional conduct.</p>
<p id="fbca6740-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset in examining the exceptions to the state action doctrine it must be recognized that the cases do not neatly fit together. Some of the decisions seem clearly inconsistent with one another and the Court often has made little effort to reconcile them. Cases concerning these exceptions have been called a “conceptual disaster area”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1068C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1068C_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">32</a></span> and even the Supreme Court has admitted that the “cases deciding when private action might be deemed that of the state have not been a model of consistency.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10698_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10698_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">33</a></span></p>
<p id="fbca6743-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="537" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-537">p. 537</span>There are several explanations for this inconsistency. In part, it reflects inherent problems with state action; the government always has the power to regulate private behavior and there never can be a clear line for when the failure to do so constitutes state action and a constitutional violation. Likewise, the government is involved, to some extent, in almost every activity. It is difficult, if not impossible, to draw a meaningful line as to the point where the involvement is great enough to require the private action to comply with the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbca8e54-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inconsistencies also reflect the way in which some of the state action decisions were written and decided. As explained below, cases with regard to both of the exceptions articulated broad principles that could make a wide range of private conduct actionable under the Constitution. Because those cases have not been overruled, but also not always followed, there is tension among the decisions.</p>
<p id="fbca8e55-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inconsistencies also reflect social realities. From the late 1940s through the 1960s, the Court expansively defined what constitutes state action as part of trying to combat racial discrimination. These decisions understandably articulated broad principles that could make a great deal of private conduct reviewable under the Constitution. Since the 1960s, especially in cases involving other constitutional provisions, the Court has applied a much narrower definition of state action. There are inconsistencies among the cases that the Court never has acknowledged or resolved.</p>
<p id="fbca8e56-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact, a review of the decisions indicates that the Court has been much more likely to apply the exceptions in cases involving race discrimination than in cases involving other constitutional claims. Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit expressly held that the scope of the exceptions to the state action doctrine turns on whether it is a claim of race discrimination or another constitutional right.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106AE_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106AE_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">34</a></span> Yet this distinction seems difficult to defend. State action is about whether the Constitution should apply because of the government’s involvement or because the act is one that is traditionally governmental in nature. It is unclear why this inquiry depends at all on the particulars of the constitutional claim.</p>
<p id="fbca8e58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inconsistency among the cases also reflects the reduced need to rely on the Constitution to reach private racial discrimination. The adoption of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited private discrimination by places of public accommodation and private employers, greatly lessened the need for constitutional litigation to end discrimination. For example, prior to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Court had to consider whether there was state action when the government leased premises to a restaurant that racially discriminated.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106BD_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N106BD_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">35</a></span> But after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the state action inquiry would have been unnecessary because the law prohibited the restaurant from racially discriminating even if there was no government involvement.</p>
<p id="fbca8e5a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two exceptions—the public functions exception and the entanglement exception—are discussed, in turn, below. It should be noted that many cases involve discussion of both exceptions and therefore are considered below under each of the exceptions. Also, in some cases, the Court is not clear as to which exception it is discussing. This, too, contributes to the doctrinal confusion concerning the state action doctrine.</p><span title="538" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-538">p. 538</span>

Alabama and Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. <i>Marsh</i> is expansive in its definition and could be used to find a great deal of private conduct to be state action. <i>Jackson</i> is quite narrow and makes it very difficult to find that private actors are performing a public function. After these contrasting cases, two important areas where the Court has considered the public functions exception are presented: elections and private property used for public purposes.</p>

The town, a suburb of Mobile, Alabama, known as Chickasaw, is owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation. Except for that it has all the characteristics of any other American town.</p>
<p id="fbcab575-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The property consists of residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated. A deputy of the Mobile County Sheriff, paid by the company, serves as the town’s policeman. Merchants and service establishments have rented the stores and business places on the business block and the United States uses one of the places as a post office from which six carriers deliver mail to the people of Chickasaw and the adjacent area. The town and the surrounding neighborhood, which can not be distinguished from the Gulf property by anyone not familiar with the property lines, are thickly settled, and according to all indications the residents use the business block as their regular shopping center. To do so, they now, as they have for many years, make use of a company-owned paved street and sidewalk located alongside the store fronts in order to enter and leave the stores and the post office. There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there. In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation.</p>
<p id="fbcab576-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, a Jehovah’s Witness, came onto the sidewalk we have just described, stood near the post-office and undertook to distribute religious literature. In the stores the corporation had posted a notice which read as follows: “This Is Private Property, and Without Written Permission, No Street, or House Vendor, Agent or Solicitation of Any Kind Will Be Permitted.” Appellant was warned that she could not distribute the literature without a permit and told that no permit would be issued to her. She protested that the company rule could not be constitutionally applied so as to prohibit her from distributing religious writings. When she was asked to leave the sidewalk and Chickasaw she declined. <span title="539" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-539">p. 539</span>The deputy sheriff arrested her and she was charged in the state court with violating the 1940 Alabama Code which makes it a crime to enter or remain on the premises of another after having been warned not to do so. Appellant contended that to construe the state statute as applicable to her activities would abridge her right to freedom of press and religion contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. This contention was rejected and she was convicted.</p>
<p id="fbcab577-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had the title to Chickasaw belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company-town it would have been clear that appellant’s conviction must be reversed. Under our decision[s], neither a state nor a municipality can completely bar the distribution of literature containing religious or political ideas on its streets, sidewalks and public places.</p>
<p id="fbcab578-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our question then narrows down to this: Can those people who live in or come to Chickasaw be denied freedom of press and religion simply because a single company has legal title to all the town? For it is the state’s contention that the mere fact that all the property interests in the town are held by a single company is enough to give that company power, enforceable by a state statute, to abridge these freedoms.</p>
<p id="fbcab579-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not agree that the corporation’s property interests settle the question. The State urges in effect that the corporation’s right to control the inhabitants of Chickasaw is coextensive with the right of a homeowner to regulate the conduct of his guests. We cannot accept that contention. Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion. The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.</p>
<p id="fbcab57a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a corporation or a municipality owns or possesses the town the public in either case has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free. As we have heretofore stated, the town of Chickasaw does not function differently from any other town. The “business block” serves as the community shopping center and is freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through. The managers appointed by the corporation cannot curtail the liberty of press and religion of these people consistently with the purposes of the Constitutional guarantees, and a state statute, as the one here involved, which enforces such action by criminally punishing those who attempt to distribute religious literature clearly violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbcab57b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many people in the United States live in company-owned towns. These people, just as residents of municipalities, are free citizens of their State and country. Just as all other citizens they must make decisions which affect the welfare of community and nation. To act as good citizens they must be informed. In order to enable them to be properly informed their information must be uncensored. There is no more reason for depriving these people of the liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments than there is for curtailing these freedoms with respect to any other citizen.</p>
<p id="fbcab57c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we balance the Constitutional rights of owners of property against those of the people to enjoy freedom of press and religion, as we must here, we remain mindful of the fact that the latter occupy a preferred position. In our <span title="540" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-540">p. 540</span>view the circumstance that the property rights to the premises where the deprivation of liberty, here involved, took place, were held by others than the public, is not sufficient to justify the State’s permitting a corporation to govern a community of citizens so as to restrict their fundamental liberties and the enforcement of such restraint by the application of a State statute. Insofar as the State has attempted to impose criminal punishment on appellant for undertaking to distribute religious literature in a company town, its action cannot stand.</p>

<p id="fbcadc92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbcadc93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent Metropolitan Edison Co. is a privately owned and operated Pennsylvania corporation which holds a certificate of public convenience issued by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission empowering it to deliver electricity to a service area which includes the city of York, Pa. As a condition of holding its certificate, it is subject to extensive regulation by the Commission. Under a provision of its general tariff filed with the Commission, it has the right to discontinue service to any customer on reasonable notice of nonpayment of bills.</p>
<p id="fbcadc94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Catherine Jackson is a resident of York, who has received electricity in the past from respondent. Until September 1970, petitioner received electric service to her home in York under an account with respondent in her own name. When her account was terminated because of asserted delinquency in payments due for service, a new account with respondent was opened in the name of one James Dodson, another occupant of the residence, and service to the residence was resumed. There is a dispute as to whether payments due under the Dodson account for services provided during this period were ever made. In August 1971, Dodson left the residence. Service continued thereafter but concededly no payments were made. Petitioner states that no bills were received during this period.</p>
<p id="fbcadc95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 6, 1971, employees of Metropolitan came to the residence and inquired as to Dodson’s present address. Petitioner stated that it was unknown to her. On the following day, another employee visited the residence and informed petitioner that the meter had been tampered with so as not to register amounts used. She disclaimed knowledge of this and requested that the service account for her home be shifted from Dodson’s name to that of Robert Jackson, later identified as her 12-year-old son. Four days later on October 11, 1971, without further notice to petitioner, Metropolitan employees disconnected her service.</p>
<p id="fbcadc96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Jackson argues that under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment she cannot be deprived of this entitlement to utility service without adequate notice and a hearing before an impartial body: until these are completed, her service must continue. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: “(N)or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In 1883, this Court in the Civil Rights Cases (1883) affirmed the essential dichotomy set forth in that Amendment between deprivation by the State, subject to scrutiny under its provisions, and private conduct, “however discriminatory or wrongful,” against which the Fourteenth Amendment offers no shield.</p>
<p id="fbcadc97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-541">p. 541</span>While the principle that private action is immune from the restrictions of the Fourteenth Amendment is well established and easily stated, the question whether particular conduct is “private,” on the one hand, or “state action,” on the other, frequently admits of no easy answer.</p>
<p id="fbcadc98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here the action complained of was taken by a utility company which is privately owned and operated, but which in many particulars of its business is subject to extensive state regulation. The mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor does the fact that the regulation is extensive and detailed, as in the case of most public utilities, do so. It may well be that acts of a heavily regulated utility with at least something of a governmentally protected monopoly will more readily be found to be “state” acts than will the acts of an entity lacking these characteristics. But the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.</p>
<p id="fbcadc99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner first argues that “state action” is present because of the monopoly status allegedly conferred upon Metropolitan by the State of Pennsylvania. As a factual matter, it may well be doubted that the State ever granted or guaranteed Metropolitan a monopoly. But assuming that it had, this fact is not determinative in considering whether Metropolitan’s termination of service to petitioner was “state action” for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcadc9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-542">p. 542</span>Petitioner next urges that state action is present because respondent provides an essential public service required to be supplied on a reasonably continuous basis by [Pennsylvania law] and hence performs a “public function.” We have, of course, found state action present in the exercise by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Nixon v. Condon (1932) (election); Terry v. Adams (1953) (election); Marsh v. Alabama (1946) (company town); Evans v. Newton (1966) (municipal park). If we were dealing with the exercise by Metropolitan of some power delegated to it by the State which is traditionally associated with sovereignty, such as eminent domain, our case would be quite a different one. But while the Pennsylvania statute imposes an obligation to furnish service on regulated utilities, it imposes no such obligation on the State. The Pennsylvania courts have rejected the contention that the furnishing of utility services is either a state function or a municipal duty.</p>
<p id="fbcadc9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps in recognition of the fact that the supplying of utility service is not traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State, petitioner invites the expansion of the doctrine of this limited line of cases into a broad principle that all businesses “affected with the public interest” are state actors in all their actions. We decline the invitation. Doctors, optometrists, lawyers, and grocery selling a quart of milk are all in regulated businesses, providing arguably essential goods and services, “affected with a public interest.” We do not believe that such a status converts their every action, absent more, into that of the State.</p>
<p id="fbcadc9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of petitioner’s arguments taken together show no more than that Metropolitan was a heavily regulated, privately owned utility, enjoying at least a partial monopoly in the providing of electrical service within its territory, and that it elected to terminate service to petitioner in a manner which the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission found permissible under state law. Under our decision this is not sufficient to connect the State of Pennsylvania with respondent’s action so as to make the latter’s conduct attributable to the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcadc9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the State of Pennsylvania is not sufficiently connected with respondent’s action in terminating petitioner’s service so as to make respondent’s conduct in so doing attributable to the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcb03ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Marshall,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbcb03af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Metropolitan Edison Co. provides an essential public service to the people of York, Pa. It is the only entity, public or private, that is authorized to supply electric service to most of the community. As a part of its charter to the company, the State imposes extensive regulations, and it cooperates with the company in myriad ways. Additionally, the State has granted its approval to the company’s mode of service termination—the very conduct that is challenged here. Taking these factors together, I have no difficulty finding state action in this case. As the Court concluded in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority (1961), the State has sufficiently “insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with (the company) that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.”</p>
<p id="fbcb03b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our state-action cases have repeatedly relied on several factors clearly presented by this case: a state-sanctioned monopoly; an extensive pattern of cooperation between the “private” entity and the State; and a service uniquely public in nature. Today the Court takes a major step in repudiating this line of authority and adopts a stance that is bound to lead to mischief when applied to problems beyond the narrow sphere of due process objections to utility terminations.</p>
<p id="fbcb03b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I disagree with the majority’s position on three separate grounds. First, the suggestion that the State would have to “put its own weight on the side of the proposed practice by ordering it” seems to me to mark a sharp departure from our previous state-action cases. [W]e have consistently indicated that state authorization and approval of “private” conduct would support a finding of state action. Second, I question the wisdom of giving such short shrift to the extensive interaction between the company and the State, and focusing solely on the extent of state support for the particular activity under challenge. Finally, it seems to me in any event that the State has given its approval to Metropolitan Edison’s termination procedures. The State Utility Commission approved a tariff provision under which the company reserved the right to discontinue its service on reasonable notice for nonpayment of bills.</p>
<p id="fbcb03b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that the Metropolitan Edison Co. supplies an essential public service that is in many communities supplied by the government weighs more heavily for me than for the majority. The Court concedes that state action might be present if the activity in question were “traditionally associated with sovereignty,” but it then undercuts that point by suggesting that a particular service is not a public function if the State in question has not required that it be governmentally operated. This reads the “public function” argument too narrowly. The whole point of the “public function” cases is to look behind the State’s decision to provide public services through private parties. In my view, utility service is traditionally identified with the State through universal public regulation or ownership to a degree sufficient to render it a “public function.”</p><span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-543">p. 543</span>

<p id="fbcb03b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Marsh</i> and <i>Jackson</i> use very different tests for the public function test. <i>Marsh</i> uses a balancing test and looks to whether the private property is used for a public purpose. <i>Jackson</i> focuses on whether it is an activity that has been traditionally, exclusively done by the government. Cases involving three different areas in which the Court has applied the public functions test follow: one dealing with elections (Terry v. Adams), one dealing with private property used for public purposes (Evans v. Newton), and one dealing with a public access cable channel. In examining these cases, consider the approach to the public functions doctrine used in each.</p>

<p id="fbcb2ac9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Black</span> announced the judgment of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbcb2aca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Smith v. Allwright (1944), we held that rules of the Democratic Party of Texas excluding Negroes from voting in the party’s primaries violated the Fifteenth Amendment. This case raises questions concerning the constitutional power of a Texas county political organization called the Jaybird Democratic Association or Jaybird Party to exclude Negroes from its primaries on racial grounds. The Jaybirds deny that their racial exclusions violate the Fifteenth Amendment. They contend that the Amendment applies only to elections or primaries held under state regulation, that their association is not regulated by the state at all, and that it is not a political party but a self-governing voluntary club.</p>
<p id="fbcb2acb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Jaybird Association or Party was organized in 1889. Its membership was then and always has been limited to white people; they are automatically members if their names appear on the official list of county voters. It has been run like other political parties with an executive committee named from the county’s voting precincts. Expenses of the party are paid by the assessment of candidates for office in its primaries. Candidates for county offices submit their names to the Jaybird Committee in accordance with the normal practice followed by regular political parties all over the country. Advertisements and posters proclaim that these candidates are running subject to the action of the Jaybird primary. While there is no legal compulsion on successful Jaybird candidates to enter Democratic primaries they have nearly always done so and with few exceptions since 1889 have run and won without opposition in the Democratic primaries and the general elections that followed. Thus the party has been the dominant political group in the county since organization, having endorsed every county-wide official elected since 1889.</p>
<p id="fbcb2acc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is apparent that Jaybird activities follow a plan purposefully designed to exclude Negroes from voting and at the same time to escape the Fifteenth Amendment’s command that the right of citizens to vote shall neither be denied nor abridged on account of race. These were the admitted party purposes according to the testimony of the Jaybird’s president.</p>
<p id="fbcb2acd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifteenth Amendment provides as follows: “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” The Amendment bans racial discrimination in voting by both state and nation. It thus establishes a national policy, obviously applicable to the right of Negroes not to be discriminated against as voters in elections to determine public governmental policies or to select public officials, national, state, or local.</p>
<p id="fbcb2ace-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="544" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-544">p. 544</span>It is significant that precisely the same qualifications as those prescribed by Texas entitling electors to vote at county-operated primaries are adopted as the sole qualifications entitling electors to vote at the county-wide Jaybird primaries with a single proviso—Negroes are excluded. Everyone concedes that such a proviso in the county-operated primaries would be unconstitutional. The Jaybird Party thus brings into being and holds precisely the kind of election that the Fifteenth Amendment seeks to prevent. When it produces the equivalent of the prohibited election, the damage has been done.</p>
<p id="fbcb2acf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a state to permit such a duplication of its election processes is to permit a flagrant abuse of those processes to defeat the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. The use of the county-operated primary to ratify the result of the prohibited election merely compounds the offense. It violates the Fifteenth Amendment for a state, by such circumvention, to permit within its borders the use of any device that produces an equivalent of the prohibited election.</p>
<p id="fbcb2ad0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only election that has counted in this Texas county for more than fifty years has been that held by the Jaybirds from which Negroes were excluded. The Democratic primary and the general election have become no more than the perfunctory ratifiers of the choice that has already been made in Jaybird elections from which Negroes have been excluded. It is immaterial that the state does not control that part of this elective process which it leaves for the Jaybirds to manage. The Jaybird primary has become an integral part, indeed the only effective part, of the elective process that determines who shall rule and govern in the county. The effect of the whole procedure, Jaybird primary plus Democratic primary plus general election, is to do precisely that which the Fifteenth Amendment forbids—strip Negroes of every vestige of influence in selecting the officials who control the local county matters that intimately touch the daily lives of citizens.</p>

The city kept the park segregated for some years but in time let Negroes use it, taking the position that the park was a public facility which it could not constitutionally manage and maintain on a segregated basis.</p>
<p id="fbcb50e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereupon, individual members of the Board of Managers of the park brought this suit in a state court against the City of Macon and the trustees of certain residuary beneficiaries of Senator Bacon’s estate, asking that the city be removed as trustee and that the court appoint new trustees, to whom title to the park would be transferred. The city answered, alleging it could not legally enforce racial segregation in the park. The other defendants admitted <span title="545" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-545">p. 545</span>the allegation and requested that the city be removed as trustee. Several Negro citizens of Macon intervened, alleging that the racial limitation was contrary to the laws and public policy of the United States, and asking that the court refuse to appoint private trustees. Moreover, other heirs of Senator Bacon intervened and they and the defendants other than the city asked for reversion of the trust property to the Bacon estate in the event that the prayer of the petition were denied. Thereafter the city resigned as trustee and amended its answer accordingly.</p>
<p id="fbcb50e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Georgia court accepted the resignation of the city as trustee and appointed three individuals as new trustees, finding it unnecessary to pass on the other claims of the heirs. On appeal by the Negro intervenors, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, holding that Senator Bacon had the right to give and bequeath his property to a limited class, that charitable trusts are subject to supervision of a court of equity, and that the power to appoint new trustees so that the purpose of the trust would not fail was clear.</p>
<p id="fbcb50ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two complementary principles to be reconciled in this case. One is the right of the individual to pick his own associates so as to express his preferences and dislikes, and to fashion his private life by joining such clubs and groups as he chooses. The other is the constitutional ban in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against state-sponsored racial inequality, which of course bars a city from acting as trustee under a private will that serves the racial segregation cause. A private golf club, however, restricted to either Negro or white membership is one expression of freedom of association. But a municipal golf course that serves only one race is state activity indicating a preference on a matter as to which the State must be neutral.</p>
<p id="fbcb50eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is “private” action and what is “state” action is not always easy to determine. “Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances” can we determine whether the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment extends to a particular case. The range of government activities is broad and varied, and the fact that government has engaged in a particular activity does not necessarily mean that an individual entrepreneur or manager of the same kind of undertaking suffers the same constitutional inhibitions.</p>
<p id="fbcb50ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a testator wanted to leave a school or center for the use of one race only and in no way implicated the State in the supervision, control, or management of that facility, we assume arguendo that no constitutional difficulty would be encountered. This park, however, is in a different posture. For years it was an integral part of the City of Macon’s activities. From the pleadings we assume it was swept, manicured, watered, patrolled, and maintained by the city as a public facility for whites only, as well as granted tax exemption. The momentum it acquired as a public facility is certainly not dissipated ipso facto by the appointment of “private” trustees. So far as this record shows, there has been no change in municipal maintenance and concern over this facility. Whether these public characteristics will in time be dissipated is wholly conjectural. If the municipality remains entwined in the management or control of the park, it remains subject to the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment. We only hold that where the tradition of municipal control had become firmly established, we cannot take judicial notice that the mere substitution of trustees instantly transferred this park from the public to the private sector.</p>
<p id="fbcb50ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion is buttressed by the nature of the service rendered the community by a park. The service rendered even by a private park of this character <span title="546" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-546">p. 546</span>is municipal in nature. It is open to every white person, there being no selective element other than race. Golf clubs, social centers, luncheon clubs, schools such as Tuskegee was at least in origin, and other like organizations in the private sector are often racially oriented. A park, on the other hand, is more like a fire department or police department that traditionally serves the community. Mass recreation through the use of parks is plainly in the public domain; and state courts that aid private parties to perform that public function on a segregated basis implicate the State in conduct proscribed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Like the streets of the company town in Marsh v. State of Alabama, and the elective process of Terry v. Adams, the predominant character and purpose of this park are municipal.</p>
<p id="fbcb50ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot but conclude that the public character of this park requires that it be treated as a public institution subject to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of who now has title under state law.</p>

<p id="fbcb7805-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment constrains governmental actors and protects private actors. To draw the line between governmental and private, this Court applies what is known as the state-action doctrine. Under that doctrine, as relevant here, a private entity may be considered a state actor when it exercises a function “traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.” Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. (1974).</p>
<p id="fbcb7806-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This state-action case concerns the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system in Manhattan. Public access channels are available for private citizens to use. The public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system in Manhattan are operated by a private nonprofit corporation known as MNN. The question here is whether MNN—even though it is a private entity—nonetheless is a state actor when it operates the public access channels. In other words, is operation of public access channels on a cable system a traditional, exclusive public function? If so, then the First Amendment would restrict MNN’s exercise of editorial discretion over the speech and speakers on the public access channels.</p>
<p id="fbcb7807-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the state-action doctrine as it has been articulated and applied by our precedents, we conclude that operation of public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function. Moreover, a private entity such as MNN who opens its property for speech by others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor. In operating the public access channels, MNN is a private actor, not a state actor, and MNN therefore is not subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial discretion.</p>

<p id="fbcb7809-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the 1970s, public access channels have been a regular feature on cable television systems throughout the United States. In the 1970s, Federal Communications Commission regulations required certain cable operators to set aside channels <span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-547">p. 547</span>on their cable systems for public access. In 1979, however, this Court ruled that the FCC lacked statutory authority to impose that mandate. A few years later, Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. The Act authorized state and local governments to require cable operators to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access.</p>
<p id="fbcb780a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York State Public Service Commission regulates cable franchising in New York State and requires cable operators in the State to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access. State law requires that use of the public access channels be free of charge and first-come, first-served. Under state law, the cable operator operates the public access channels unless the local government in the area chooses to itself operate the channels or designates a private entity to operate the channels.</p>
<p id="fbcb780b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Time Warner (now known as Charter) operates a cable system in Manhattan. Under state law, Time Warner must set aside some channels on its cable system for public access. New York City (the City) has designated a private nonprofit corporation named Manhattan Neighborhood Network, commonly referred to as MNN, to operate Time Warner’s public access channels in Manhattan. This case involves a complaint against MNN regarding its management of the public access channels.</p>
<p id="fbcb780c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss, we accept the allegations in the complaint as true. DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez produced public access programming in Manhattan. They made a film about MNN’s alleged neglect of the East Harlem community. Halleck submitted the film to MNN for airing on MNN’s public access channels, and MNN later televised the film. Afterwards, MNN fielded multiple complaints about the film’s content. In response, MNN temporarily suspended Halleck from using the public access channels. Halleck and Melendez soon became embroiled in another dispute with MNN staff. In the wake of that dispute, MNN ultimately suspended Halleck and Melendez from all MNN services and facilities.</p>
<p id="fbcb780d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Halleck and Melendez then sued MNN, among other parties, in Federal District Court. The two producers claimed that MNN violated their First Amendment free-speech rights when MNN restricted their access to the public access channels because of the content of their film.</p>
<p id="fbcb780e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MNN moved to dismiss the producers’ First Amendment claim on the ground that MNN is not a state actor and therefore is not subject to First Amendment restrictions on its editorial discretion.</p>

<p id="fbcb9f20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text and original meaning of [the First and Fourteenth] Amendments, as well as this Court’s longstanding precedents, establish that the Free Speech Clause prohibits only <i>governmental</i> abridgment of speech. The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit <i>private</i> abridgment of speech. In accord with the text and structure of the Constitution, this Court’s state-action doctrine distinguishes the government from individuals and private entities. By enforcing that constitutional boundary between the governmental and the private, the state-action doctrine protects a robust sphere of individual liberty.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the producers claim that MNN, a private entity, restricted their access to MNN’s public access channels because of the content of the producers’ <span title="548" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-548">p. 548</span>film. The producers have advanced a First Amendment claim against MNN. The threshold problem with that First Amendment claim is a fundamental one: MNN is a private entity.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying on this Court’s state-action precedents, the producers assert that MNN is nonetheless a state actor subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial discretion. Under this Court’s cases, a private entity can qualify as a state actor in a few limited circumstances—including, for example, (i) when the private entity performs a traditional, exclusive public function; (ii) when the government compels the private entity to take a particular action; or (iii) when the government acts jointly with the private entity.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The producers’ primary argument here falls into the first category: The producers contend that MNN exercises a traditional, exclusive public function when it operates the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system in Manhattan. We disagree.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Court’s cases, a private entity may qualify as a state actor when it exercises “powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.” It is not enough that the federal, state, or local government exercised the function in the past, or still does. And it is not enough that the function serves the public good or the public interest in some way. Rather, to qualify as a traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning of our state-action precedents, the government must have traditionally <i>and</i> exclusively performed the function.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has stressed that “very few” functions fall into that category. Under the Court’s cases, those functions include, for example, running elections and operating a company town. The Court has ruled that a variety of functions do not fall into that category, including, for example: running sports associations and leagues, administering insurance payments, operating nursing homes, providing special education, representing indigent criminal defendants, resolving private disputes, and supplying electricity.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relevant function in this case is operation of public access channels on a cable system. That function has not traditionally and exclusively been performed by government.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the 1970s, when public access channels became a regular feature on cable systems, a variety of private and public actors have operated public access channels, including: private cable operators; private nonprofit organizations; municipalities; and other public and private community organizations such as churches, schools, and libraries.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of public access channels in Manhattan further illustrates the point. In 1971, public access channels first started operating in Manhattan. Those early Manhattan public access channels were operated in large part by private cable operators, with some help from private nonprofit organizations. Those private cable operators continued to operate the public access channels until the early 1990s, when MNN (also a private entity) began to operate the public access channels.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, operating public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning of this Court’s cases.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kagan</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f2b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court tells a very reasonable story about a case that is not before us. I write to address the one that is. This is a case about an organization appointed <span title="549" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-549">p. 549</span>by the government to administer a constitutional public forum. (It is not, as the Court suggests, about a private property owner that simply opened up its property to others.) New York City (the City) secured a property interest in public-access television channels when it granted a cable franchise to a cable company. State regulations require those public-access channels to be made open to the public on terms that render them a public forum. The City contracted out the administration of that forum to a private organization, petitioner Manhattan Community Access Corporation (MNN). By accepting that agency relationship, MNN stepped into the City’s shoes and thus qualifies as a state actor, subject to the First Amendment like any other.</p>

<p id="fbcb9f2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A cable-television franchise is, essentially, a license to create a system for distributing cable TV in a certain area. It is a valuable right, usually conferred on a private company by a local government. A private company cannot enter a local cable market without one.</p>
<p id="fbcb9f2e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cable companies transmit content through wires that stretch “between a transmission facility and the television sets of individual subscribers.” Creating this network of wires is a disruptive undertaking that “entails the use of public rights-of-way and easements.”</p>
<p id="fbcb9f2f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York State authorizes municipalities to grant cable franchises to cable companies of a certain size only if those companies agree to set aside at least one public access channel. New York then requires that those public-access channels be open to all comers on “a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.” Likewise, the State prohibits both cable franchisees and local governments from “exercis[ing] any editorial control” over the channels, aside from regulating obscenity and other unprotected content.</p>

<p id="fbcbc641-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would affirm the judgment below. The channels are clearly a public forum: The City has a property interest in them, and New York regulations require that access to those channels be kept open to all. And because the City (1) had a duty to provide that public forum once it granted a cable franchise and (2) had a duty to abide by the First Amendment once it provided that forum, those obligations did not evaporate when the City delegated the administration of that forum to a private entity. Just as the City would have been subject to the First Amendment had it chosen to run the forum itself, MNN assumed the same responsibility when it accepted the delegation.</p>
<p id="fbcbc642-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, respondents alleged viewpoint discrimination. So a key question in this case concerns what the Manhattan public-access channels are: a public forum of some kind, in which a claim alleging viewpoint discrimination would be cognizable, or something else, such as government speech or purely private property, where picking favored viewpoints is appropriately commonplace. Neither MNN nor the majority suggests that this is an instance of government speech. This case thus turns first and foremost on whether the public-access channels are or are not purely private property.</p>
<p id="fbcbc643-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>This Court has not defined precisely what kind of governmental property interest (if any) is necessary for a public forum to exist. I assume for the sake of argument in this case that public-forum analysis is inappropriate where the government lacks a “significant property interest consistent with the communicative purpose of the forum.”</p>
<p id="fbcbc644-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such an interest is present here. As described above, New York State required the City to obtain public-access channels from Time Warner in exchange for awarding a cable franchise. The exclusive right to use these channels (and, as necessary, Time Warner’s infrastructure) qualifies as a property interest, akin at the very least to an easement.</p>
<p id="fbcbc645-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, there is no disputing that Time Warner owns the wires themselves. If the wires were a road, it would be easy to define the public’s right to walk on it as an easement. Similarly, if the wires were a theater, there would be no question that a government’s long-term lease to use it would be sufficient for public-forum purposes. But some may find this case more complicated because the wires are not a road or a theater that one can physically occupy; they are a conduit for transmitting signals that appear as television channels. In other words, the question is how to understand the right to place content on those channels using those wires.</p>
<p id="fbcbc646-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to convey expressive content using someone else’s physical infrastructure is not new. To give another low-tech example, imagine that one company owns a billboard and another rents space on that billboard. The renter can have a property interest in placing content on the billboard for the lease term even though it does not own the billboard itself.</p>
<p id="fbcbc647-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same principle should operate in this higher tech realm. Just as if the channels were a billboard, the City obtained rights for exclusive use of the channels by the public for the foreseeable future; no one is free to take the channels away, short of a contract renegotiation. The City also obtained the right to administer, or delegate the administration of, the channels. The channels are more intangible than a billboard, but no one believes that a right must be tangible to qualify as a property interest. And it is hardly unprecedented for a government to receive a right to transmit something over a private entity’s infrastructure in exchange for conferring something of value on that private entity; examples go back at least as far as the 1800s.</p>
<p id="fbcbc648-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not suggest that the government always obtains a property interest in public-access channels created by franchise agreements. But the arrangement here is consistent with what the Court would treat as a governmental property interest in other contexts. New York City gave Time Warner the right to lay wires and sell cable TV. In exchange, the City received an exclusive right to send its own signal over Time Warner’s infrastructure—no different than receiving a right to place ads on another’s billboards. Those rights amount to a governmental property interest in the channels, and that property interest is clearly “consistent with the communicative purpose of the forum.” Indeed, it is the right to transmit the very content to which New York law grants the public open and equal access.</p>

The majority swings hard at the wrong pitch. The majority focuses on Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. (1974), which is a paradigmatic example of a line of cases that reject §1983 liability for private actors that simply operate against a regulatory backdrop.</p>
<p id="fbcbc64b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Jackson</i> line of cases is inapposite here. MNN is not a private entity that simply ventured into the marketplace. It occupies its role because it was asked to do so by the City, which secured the public-access channels in exchange for giving up public rights of way, opened those channels up (as required by the State) as a public forum, and then deputized MNN to administer them. That distinguishes MNN from a private entity that simply sets up shop against a regulatory backdrop. To say that MNN is nothing more than a private organization regulated by the government is like saying that a waiter at a restaurant is an independent food seller who just happens to be highly regulated by the restaurant’s owners.</p>

New York City opened up a public forum on public-access channels in which it has a property interest. It asked MNN to run that public forum, and MNN accepted the job. That makes MNN subject to the First Amendment, just as if the City had decided to run the public forum itself.</p>

It is crucial that the Court does not continue to ignore the reality, fully recognized by our precedents, that private actors who have been delegated constitutional responsibilities like this one should be accountable to the Constitution’s demands.</p>

<p id="fbcbed5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court also has considered the application of the public function doctrine in deciding whether there is a First Amendment right to use privately owned shopping centers for speech purposes. The Court initially analogized shopping centers to the company town in Marsh v. Alabama and concluded that there is a First Amendment right of access. The Court then qualified this right and finally it overturned its initial ruling and held that there is no First Amendment right to use private shopping centers for speech purposes.</p>
<p id="fbcbed60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U.S. 308 (1968), the Supreme Court held that a privately owned shopping center could not exclude striking laborers from picketing a store within it. The Court expressly analogized to <i>Marsh</i> and said that “[t]he similarities between the business block in <i>Marsh</i> and the shopping center . . . are striking. . . . The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in <i>Marsh</i>.” The Court emphasized that the shopping center was open to the public and functionally was the same as the commercial center of a town.</p>
<p id="fbcbed61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just four years later, in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 391 U.S. 308 (1968), the Supreme Court held that a privately owned shopping center could exclude anti–Vietnam War protestors from distributing literature on its premises. The <span title="552" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-552">p. 552</span>Court distinguished <i>Logan Valley</i> on the ground that it involved a labor protest related to the functioning of a store in the shopping center, whereas the speech in <i>Lloyd</i> was an antiwar protest unrelated to the conduct of the business.</p>
<p id="fbcbed62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there is a common-sense basis for this distinction, constitutionally it is difficult to defend. The Supreme Court long has held that the core of the First Amendment is that the government cannot regulate speech based on its content. Yet <i>Lloyd</i> makes the content of the speech decisive in determining whether it will be allowed. Under <i>Lloyd,</i> speech in shopping centers is constitutionally protected and can be the basis for a trespassing conviction only if its content concerns the functioning of the shopping centers. Also, it is difficult to explain why the determination of whether a private shopping center is a state actor for First Amendment purposes should turn on the message being expressed.</p>

<p id="fbcc1478-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Stewart</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbcc1479-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A group of labor union members who engaged in peaceful primary picketing within the confines of a privately owned shopping center were threatened by an agent of the owner with arrest for criminal trespass if they did not depart. The petitioner, Scott Hudgens, is the owner of the North DeKalb Shopping Center, located in suburban Atlanta, Ga. The center consists of a single large building with an enclosed mall. Surrounding the building is a parking area which can accommodate 2,640 automobiles. The shopping center houses 60 retail stores leased to various businesses. One of the lessees is the Butler Shoe Co. Most of the stores, including Butler’s, can be entered only from the interior mall.</p>
<p id="fbcc147a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1971, warehouse employees of the Butler Shoe Co. went on strike to protest the company’s failure to agree to demands made by their union in contract negotiations. The strikers decided to picket not only Butler’s warehouse but its nine retail stores in the Atlanta area as well, including the store in the North DeKalb Shopping Center. On January 22, 1971, four of the striking warehouse employees entered the center’s enclosed mall carrying placards which read: “Butler Shoe Warehouse on Strike, AFL-CIO, Local 315.” The general manager of the shopping center informed the employees that they could not picket within the mall or on the parking lot and threatened them with arrest if they did not leave. The employees departed but returned a short time later and began picketing in an area of the mall immediately adjacent to the entrances of the Butler store. After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing. The pickets departed.</p>
<p id="fbcc147b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state. Thus, while statutory or common law may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others, no such protection or redress is provided by the Constitution itself. This elementary proposition is little more than a truism.</p>
<p id="fbcc147c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It matters not that some Members of the Court may continue to believe that the <i>Logan Valley</i> case was rightly decided. Our institutional duty is to follow until changed the law as it now is, not as some Members of the Court might wish it to be. And in the performance of that duty we make clear now, if it was not clear <span title="553" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-553">p. 553</span>before, that the rationale of <i>Logan Valley</i> did not survive the Court’s decision in the <i>Lloyd</i> case. [T]he ultimate holding in <i>Lloyd</i> amounted to a total rejection of the holding in <i>Logan Valley.</i></p>
<p id="fbcc147d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a large self-contained shopping center is the functional equivalent of a municipality, as <i>Logan Valley</i> held, then the First and Fourteenth Amendments would not permit control of speech within such a center to depend upon the speech’s content. For while a municipality may constitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the use of its streets and sidewalks for First Amendment purposes, and may even forbid altogether such use of some of its facilities, what a municipality may not do under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is to discriminate in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression. “[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley. It conversely follows, therefore, that if the respondents in the <i>Lloyd</i> case did not have a First Amendment right to enter that shopping center to distribute handbills concerning Vietnam, then the pickets in the present case did not have a First Amendment right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against the Butler Shoe Co. We conclude, in short, that under the present state of the law the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this.</p>

<p id="fbcc3b90-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other major exception to the state action doctrine is termed the “entanglement exception.” Under this exception, the Constitution applies if the government affirmatively authorizes, encourages, or facilitates private conduct that violates the Constitution. Either the government must cease its involvement with the private actor or the private entity must comply with the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fbcc3b91-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key question, then, is what degree of government involvement is sufficient to make the Constitution applicable? What types of government encouragement are sufficient for state action? Unfortunately, the entanglement exception cases are even more inconsistent than those concerning the public function exception.</p>
<p id="fbcc3b92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The entanglement exception cases have arisen primarily in four areas: judicial and law enforcement actions, government licensing and regulation, government subsidies, and voter initiatives permitting discrimination. These categories are admittedly arbitrary in that many cases involve all or most of these government activities, just as cases often involve both the public functions and the entanglement exception. Nonetheless, the categories at least provide useful groupings for considering the cases.</p>

<p id="fbcc3b9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Vinson</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbcc62ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases present for our consideration questions relating to the validity of court enforcement of private agreements, generally described as restrictive <span title="554" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-554">p. 554</span>covenants, which have as their purpose the exclusion of persons of designated race or color.</p>
<p id="fbcc62ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 16, 1911, thirty out of a total of thirty-nine owners of property fronting both sides of Labadie Avenue between Taylor Avenue and Cora Avenue in the city of St. Louis, signed an agreement, which was subsequently recorded, providing in part: . . . “the said property is hereby restricted to the use and occupancy for the term of Fifty (50) years from this date, so that it shall be a condition all the time and whether recited and referred to as [sic] not in subsequent conveyances and shall attach to the land, as a condition precedent to the sale of the same, that hereafter no part of said property or any portion thereof shall be, for said term of Fifty-years, occupied by any person not of the Caucasian race, it being intended hereby to restrict the use of said property for said period of time against the occupancy as owners or tenants of any portion of said property for resident or other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.”</p>
<p id="fbcc62ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The entire district described in the agreement included fifty-seven parcels of land. The thirty owners who signed the agreement held title to forty-seven parcels, including the particular parcel involved in this case. At the time the agreement was signed, five of the parcels in the district were owned by Negroes. One of those had been occupied by Negro families since 1882, nearly thirty years before the restrictive agreement was executed.</p>
<p id="fbcc62ae-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 11, 1945, pursuant to a contract of sale, petitioners Shelley, who are Negroes, for valuable consideration received from one Fitzgerald a warranty deed to the parcel in question. The trial court found that petitioners had no actual knowledge of the restrictive agreement at the time of the purchase. On October 9, 1945, respondents, as owners of other property subject to the terms of the restrictive covenant, brought suit in Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis praying that petitioners Shelley be restrained from taking possession of the property and that judgment be entered divesting title out of petitioners Shelley and revesting title in the immediate grantor or in such other person as the court should direct.</p>
<p id="fbcc62af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be doubted that among the civil rights intended to be protected from discriminatory state action by the Fourteenth Amendment are the rights to acquire, enjoy, own and dispose of property. Equality in the enjoyment of property rights was regarded by the framers of that Amendment as an essential pre-condition to the realization of other basic civil rights and liberties which the Amendment was intended to guarantee. It is clear that restrictions on the right of occupancy of the sort sought to be created by the private agreements in these cases could not be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment if imposed by state statute or local ordinance.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the present cases do not involve action by state legislatures or city councils. Here the particular patterns of discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are to operate, are determined, in the first instance, by the terms of agreements among private individuals. Participation of the State consists in the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we are here confronted is whether this distinction removes these cases from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may <span title="555" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-555">p. 555</span>fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the agreements. The respondents urge that judicial enforcement of private agreements does not amount to state action; or, in any event, the participation of the State is so attenuated in character as not to amount to state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the action of state courts and of judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, is a proposition which has long been established by decisions of this Court. That principle was given expression in the earliest cases involving the construction of the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, in Commonwealth of Virginia v. Rives (1880) this Court stated: “It is doubtless true that a State may act through different agencies,—either by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities; and the prohibitions of the amendment extend to all action of the State denying equal protection of the laws, whether it be action by one of these agencies or by another.” Similar expressions, giving specific recognition to the fact that judicial action is to be regarded as action on the State for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, are to be found in numerous cases which have been more recently decided.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the examples of state judicial action which have been held by this Court to violate the Amendment’s commands are not restricted to situations in which the judicial proceedings were found in some manner to be procedurally unfair. It has been recognized that the action of state courts in enforcing a substantive common-law rule formulated by those courts, may result in the denial of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even though the judicial proceedings in such cases may have been in complete accord with the most rigorous conceptions of procedural due process.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The short of the matter is that from the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment until the present, it has been the consistent ruling of this Court that the action of the States to which the Amendment has reference, includes action of state courts and state judicial officials. Although, in construing the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, differences have from time to time been expressed as to whether particular types of state action may be said to offend the Amendment’s prohibitory provisions, it has never been suggested that state court action is immunized from the operation of those provisions simply because the act is that of the judicial branch of the state government.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this background of judicial construction, extending over a period of some three-quarters of a century, we are called upon to consider whether enforcement by state courts of the restrictive agreements in these cases may be deemed to be the acts of those States; and, if so, whether that action has denied these petitioners the equal protection of the laws which the Amendment was intended to insure. We have no doubt that there has been state action in these cases in the full and complete sense of the phrase.</p>
<p id="fbcc62b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are not cases, as has been suggested, in which the States have merely abstained from action, leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as they see fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full coercive power of government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of race or color, the enjoyment of property <span title="556" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-556">p. 556</span>rights in premises which petitioners are willing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors are willing to sell. The difference between judicial enforcement and nonenforcement of the restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners between being denied rights of property available to other members of the community and being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing. We hold that in granting judicial enforcement of the restrictive agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the equal protection of the laws and that, therefore, the action of the state courts cannot stand.</p>

<p id="fbcc89c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Shelley</i> long has been controversial, there seems little doubt that judges are government actors and that judicial remedies are state action. It was also not controversial when the Supreme Court held in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), 15 years after <i>Shelley</i>, that the common law of libel is state action that must comply with the First Amendment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A35_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A35_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">36</a></span> The Court said that although the defamation action was a “civil lawsuit between private parties, the Alabama courts have applied a state rule of law which [allegedly] . . . impose[s] invalid restrictions on their constitutional freedoms. . . . It matters not that the law has been applied in a civil action and that it is common law only. . . . The test is not the form in which state power has been applied but, whatever the form, whether such power has in fact been exercised.”</p>
<p id="fbcc89ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From this perspective, <i>Shelley</i> seems unremarkable: A branch of the government, the judiciary, was enforcing the law of the state, albeit the common law, to enforce racial discrimination by enforcing the discriminatory covenants.</p>
<p id="fbcc89cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet <i>Shelley</i> remains controversial because ultimately everything can be made state action under it. If any decision by a state court represents state action, then ultimately all private actions must comply with the Constitution. Anyone who believes that his or her rights have been violated can sue in state court. If the court dismisses the case because the state law does not forbid the violation, there is state action sustaining the infringement of the right, just as there would have been state action had the court dismissed the case in <i>Shelley.</i> All private violations of rights exist because state law allows them. It is difficult to imagine anything that cannot potentially be transformed into state action under this reasoning.</p>
<p id="fbcc89cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, of course, never has taken <i>Shelley</i> this far; nor has it articulated any clear limiting principles. In fact, the Court only rarely has applied <i>Shelley</i> as a basis for finding state action.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A56_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10A56_ef81049d-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">37</a></span> There are two major areas in which the Court has considered judicial enforcement as state action: use of courts for prejudgment attachment and the use of peremptory challenges at trials.</p>

<p id="fbccb0e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1977, petitioner, a lessee-operator of a truckstop in Virginia, was indebted to his supplier, Edmondson Oil Co., Inc. Edmondson sued on the debt in Virginia state court. Ancillary to that action and pursuant to state law, Edmondson sought prejudgment attachment of certain of petitioner’s property. The procedure required only that Edmondson allege, in an ex parte petition, a belief that petitioner was disposing of or might dispose of his property in order to defeat his creditors. Acting upon that petition, a Clerk of the state court issued a writ of attachment, which was then executed by the County Sheriff. This effectively sequestered petitioner’s property, although it was left in his possession. Pursuant to the statute, a hearing on the propriety of the attachment and levy was later conducted. Thirty-four days after the levy, a state trial judge ordered the attachment dismissed because Edmondson had failed to establish the statutory grounds for attachment alleged in the petition.</p>

<p id="fbccb0e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a defendant debtor in state-court debt collection proceedings can successfully challenge, on federal due process grounds, the plaintiff creditor’s resort to the procedures authorized by a state statute, it is difficult to understand why that same behavior by the state-court plaintiff should not provide a cause of action under §1983. If the creditor-plaintiff violates the debtor-defendant’s due process rights by seizing his property in accordance with statutory procedures, there is little or no reason to deny to the latter a cause of action under the federal statute, §1983, designed to provide judicial redress for just such constitutional violations.</p>
<p id="fbccb0e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of substantive constitutional law the state-action requirement reflects judicial recognition of the fact that most rights secured by the Constitution are protected only against infringement by governments. Careful adherence to the “state action” requirement preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power. It also avoids imposing on the State, its agencies or officials, responsibility for conduct for which they cannot fairly be blamed. A major consequence is to require the courts to respect the limits of their own power as directed against state governments and private interests. Whether this is good or bad policy, it is a fundamental fact of our political order.</p>
<p id="fbccb0e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases have accordingly insisted that the conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right be fairly attributable to the State. These cases reflect a two-part approach to this question of “fair attribution.” First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the State is responsible. Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor. This may be because he is a <span title="558" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-558">p. 558</span>state official, because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the State. Without a limit such as this, private parties could face constitutional litigation whenever they seek to rely on some state rule governing their interactions with the community surrounding them.</p>
<p id="fbccb0ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to this case, the first question is whether the claimed deprivation has resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority. The second question is whether, under the facts of this case, respondents, who are private parties, may be appropriately characterized as “state actors.” While private misuse of a state statute does not describe conduct that can be attributed to the State, the procedural scheme created by the statute obviously is the product of state action. This is subject to constitutional restraints and properly may be addressed in a §1983 action, if the second element of the state-action requirement is met as well. [W]e have consistently held that a private party’s joint participation with state officials in the seizure of disputed property is sufficient to characterize that party as a “state actor” for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbccb0eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals erred in holding that in this context “joint participation” required something more than invoking the aid of state officials to take advantage of state-created attachment procedures. That holding is contrary to the conclusions we have reached as to the applicability of due process standards to such procedures. Whatever may be true in other contexts, this is sufficient when the State has created a system whereby state officials will attach property on the ex parte application of one party to a private dispute. In summary, petitioner was deprived of his property through state action; respondents were, therefore, acting under color of state law in participating in that deprivation.</p>

<p id="fbccb0ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lugar</i> can be contrasted to the Supreme Court’s earlier decision in Flagg Brothers v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978). In <i>Flagg Brothers</i>, the Supreme Court held that a private creditor’s self-help repossession did not constitute state action and thus due process was not required prior to the sale of her belongings. After an individual was evicted from her home, the sheriff arranged for storage of her possessions at a warehouse. The warehouse demanded that she pay the storage fees or it would sell her property. The customer claimed a right to due process before the sale, but the Supreme Court concluded that since the warehouse company was privately owned the Constitution did not apply.</p>
<p id="fbccb0ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The customer’s primary contention was that the State of New York “delegated” to the company “a power ‘traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.’” The customer argued that resolving disputes is a traditional function of government and that the government had delegated this task to the creditor by giving it the authority to sell the goods to pay the debt. The Supreme Court expressly rejected this argument and said that there were many ways in which the dispute could have been resolved: The debtor could have sought a waiver of the creditor’s rights to sell her goods, the debtor could have sought to replevy her goods under state law, and the debtor had a statutory damages action available for violations of the law. The Supreme Court said that in light of all these options, it could not be said that the government delegated to the creditor “an exclusive prerogative of the sovereign.”</p>

Yet, in both cases, state law provided the procedures for the debtors’ action. In <i>Lugar</i>, state law provided the procedure for prejudgment attachment; in <i>Flagg Brothers</i>, state law provided for the self-help action. In fact, in <i>Flagg Brothers</i> involvement of the sheriff was unnecessary precisely because the state’s law allowed the repossession action without assistance of the sheriff.</p>

Edmonson sued Leesville Concrete Company for negligence in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, claiming that a Leesville employee permitted one of the company’s trucks to roll backward and pin him against some construction equipment. Edmonson invoked his Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury.</p>
<p id="fbccd80a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During voir dire, Leesville used two of its three peremptory challenges authorized by statute to remove black persons from the prospective jury. Citing our decision in Batson v.

The District Court denied the request on the ground that <i>Batson</i> does not apply in civil proceedings. As empaneled, the jury included 11 white persons and 1 black person. The jury rendered a verdict for Edmonson, assessing his total damages at $90,000. It also attributed 80% of the fault to Edmonson’s contributory negligence, however, and awarded him the sum of $18,000.</p>

<p id="fbccff1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That an act violates the Constitution when committed by a government official, however, does not answer the question whether the same act offends constitutional guarantees if committed by a private litigant or his attorney. The Constitution’s protections of individual liberty and equal protection apply in general only to action by the government.</p>
<p id="fbccff1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin our discussion within the framework for state-action analysis set forth in <i>Lugar.</i> There we considered the state-action question in the context of a due process challenge to a State’s procedure allowing private parties to obtain prejudgment attachments. We asked first whether the claimed constitutional deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority, and second, whether the private party charged with the deprivation could be described in all fairness as a state actor.</p>
<p id="fbccff1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no question that the first part of the <i>Lugar</i> inquiry is satisfied here. By their very nature, peremptory challenges have no significance outside a court of law. Their sole purpose is to permit litigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact. While we have recognized the value of peremptory challenges in this regard, particularly in the criminal context, there is no constitutional obligation to allow them. Peremptory challenges are permitted only when the government, by statute or decisional law, deems it appropriate to allow parties to exclude a given number of persons who otherwise would satisfy the requirements for service on the petit jury. Legislative authorizations, as well as limitations, for the use of peremptory challenges date as far back as the founding of the Republic; and the common-law origins of peremptories predate that.</p>
<p id="fbccff20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today in most jurisdictions, statutes or rules make a limited number of peremptory challenges available to parties in both civil and criminal proceedings. In the case before us, the challenges were exercised under a federal statute that provides, “In civil cases, each party shall be entitled to three peremptory challenges.” 28 U.S.C. §1870. Without this authorization, granted by an Act of Congress itself, Leesville would not have been able to engage in the alleged discriminatory acts.</p>
<p id="fbccff21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that the statutory authorization for the challenges exercised in this case is clear, the remainder of our state-action analysis centers around the second part of the <i>Lugar</i> test, whether a private litigant in all fairness must be deemed a government actor in the use of peremptory challenges. Our precedents establish that, in determining whether a particular action or course of conduct is governmental in character, it is relevant to examine the following: the extent to which the actor relies on governmental assistance and benefits, whether the actor is performing a traditional governmental function, and whether the injury caused is aggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority. Based on our application of these three principles to the circumstances here, we hold that the exercise of peremptory challenges by the defendant in the District Court was pursuant to a course of state action.</p>
<p id="fbccff22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although private use of state-sanctioned private remedies or procedures does not rise, by itself, to the level of state action, our cases have found state action when private parties make extensive use of state procedures with “the overt, significant assistance of state officials.” It cannot be disputed that, without the <span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-561">p. 561</span>overt, significant participation of the government, the peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury trial system of which it is a part, simply could not exist.</p>
<p id="fbccff23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A private party could not exercise its peremptory challenges absent the overt, significant assistance of the court. The government summons jurors, constrains their freedom of movement, and subjects them to public scrutiny and examination. The party who exercises a challenge invokes the formal authority of the court, which must discharge the prospective juror, thus effecting the “final and practical denial” of the excluded individual’s opportunity to serve on the petit jury. Without the direct and indispensable participation of the judge, who beyond all question is a state actor, the peremptory challenge system would serve no purpose. By enforcing a discriminatory peremptory challenge, the court “has not only made itself a party to the [biased act], but has elected to place its power, property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination.” Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority (1961). In so doing, the government has “create[d] the legal framework governing the [challenged] conduct,” National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian (1988), and in a significant way has involved itself with invidious discrimination.</p>

<p id="fbccff24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992), the Court considered “whether a criminal defendant’s exercise of a peremptory challenge constitutes state action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.” If any one is the antithesis of the government, it is a criminal defendant who is being prosecuted. Yet, for purposes of jury selection, the Court found that a criminal defendant is a state actor in exercising peremptory challenges. The Court followed exactly the same reasoning as in <i>Edmonson</i>: Laws create peremptory challenges and jury selection is a government function accomplished through the power of the state and overseen by a judge.</p>

<p id="fbcd263f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief it is admitted that the Eagle Coffee Shoppe, Inc., a restaurant located within an off-street automobile <span title="562" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-562">p. 562</span>parking building in Wilmington, Delaware, has refused to serve appellant food or drink solely because he is a Negro. The parking building is owned and operated by the Wilmington Parking Authority, an agency of the State of Delaware, and the restaurant is the Authority’s lessee. On the merits we have concluded that the exclusion of appellant under the circumstances shown to be present here was discriminatory state action in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcd2640-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Authority was created by the City of Wilmington pursuant to the Delaware Code. It is “a public body corporate and politic, exercising public powers of the State as an agency thereof.” Its statutory purpose is to provide adequate parking facilities for the convenience of the public and thereby relieve the “parking crisis, which threatens the welfare of the community.” To this end the Authority is granted wide powers including that of constructing or acquiring by lease, purchase or condemnation, lands and facilities, and that of leasing “portions of any of its garage buildings or structures for commercial uses by the lessee, where, in the opinion of the Authority, such leasing is necessary and feasible for the financing and operation of such facilities.”</p>
<p id="fbcd2641-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first project undertaken by the Authority was the erection of a parking facility on Ninth Street in downtown Wilmington. Before it began actual construction of the facility, the Authority was advised by its retained experts that the anticipated revenue from the parking of cars and proceeds from sale of its bonds would not be sufficient to finance the construction costs of the facility. Moreover, the bonds were not expected to be marketable if payable solely out of parking revenues. To secure additional capital needed for its “debt-service” requirements, and thereby to make bond financing practicable, the Authority decided it was necessary to enter long-term leases with responsible tenants for commercial use of some of the space available in the projected “garage building.” The public was invited to bid for these leases. In April 1957 such a private lease, for 20 years and renewable for another 10 years, was made with Eagle Coffee Shoppe, Inc., for use as a “restaurant, dining room, banquet hall, cocktail lounge and bar and for no other use and purpose.”</p>
<p id="fbcd2642-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other portions of the structure were leased to other tenants, including a book-store, a retail jeweler, and a food store. Upon completion of the building, the Authority located at appropriate places thereon official signs indicating the public character of the building, and flew from mastheads on the roof both the state and national flags.</p>
<p id="fbcd2643-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August 1958 appellant parked his car in the building and walked around to enter the restaurant by its front door on Ninth Street. Having entered and sought service, he was refused it. Thereafter he filed this declaratory judgment action.</p>
<p id="fbcd2644-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Civil Rights Cases (1883) “embedded in our constitutional law” the principle “that the action inhibited by the first section (Equal Protection Clause) of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.” That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful. Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.</p>
<p id="fbcd2645-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The land and building were publicly owned. As an entity, the building was dedicated to “public uses” in performance of the Authority’s “essential governmental functions.” The costs of land acquisition, construction, and maintenance <span title="563" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-563">p. 563</span>are defrayed entirely from donations by the City of Wilmington, from loans and revenue bonds and from the proceeds of rentals and parking services out of which the loans and bonds were payable. Upkeep and maintenance of the building, including necessary repairs, were responsibilities of the Authority and were payable out of public funds. It cannot be doubted that the peculiar relationship of the restaurant to the parking facility in which it is located confers on each an incidental variety of mutual benefits. Guests of the restaurant are afforded a convenient place to park their automobiles, even if they cannot enter the restaurant directly from the parking area. Similarly, its convenience for diners may well provide additional demand for the Authority’s parking facilities. Neither can it be ignored, especially in view of Eagle’s affirmative allegation that for it to serve Negroes would injure its business, that profits earned by discrimination not only contribute to, but also are indispensable elements in, the financial success of a governmental agency.</p>
<p id="fbcd2646-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Addition of all these activities, obligations and responsibilities of the Authority, the benefits mutually conferred, together with the obvious fact that the restaurant is operated as an integral part of a public building devoted to a public parking service, indicates that degree of state participation and involvement in discriminatory action which it was the design of the Fourteenth Amendment to condemn. It is irony amounting to grave injustice that in one part of a single building, erected and maintained with public funds by an agency of the State to serve a public purpose, all persons have equal rights, while in another portion, also serving the public, a Negro is a second-class citizen, offensive because of his race, without rights and unentitled to service, but at the same time fully enjoys equal access to nearby restaurants in wholly privately owned buildings.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d57-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]n its lease with Eagle the Authority could have affirmatively required Eagle to discharge the responsibilities under the Fourteenth Amendment imposed upon the private enterprise as a consequence of state participation. But no State may effectively abdicate its responsibilities by either ignoring them or by merely failing to discharge them whatever the motive may be. By its inaction, the Authority, and through it the State, has not only made itself a party to the refusal of service, but has elected to place its power, property and prestige behind the admitted discrimination. The State has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with Eagle that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity, which, on that account, cannot be considered to have been so “purely private” as to fall without the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d58-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specifically defining the limits of our inquiry, what we hold today is that when a State leases public property in the manner and for the purpose shown to have been the case here, the proscriptions of the Fourteenth Amendment must be complied with by the lessee as certainly as though they were binding covenants written into the agreement itself.</p>

<p id="fbcd4d5e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Irvis, a Negro (hereafter appellee), was refused service by appellant Moose Lodge, a local branch of the national fraternal organization located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Appellee then brought this action under 42 U.S.C. <span title="564" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-564">p. 564</span>§1983 for injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He claimed that because the Pennsylvania liquor board had issued appellant Moose Lodge a private club license that authorized the sale of alcoholic beverages on its premises, the refusal of service to him was “state action” for the purposes of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He named both Moose Lodge and the Pennsylvania Liquor Authority as defendants, seeking injunctive relief that would have required the defendant liquor board to revoke Moose Lodge’s license so long as it continued its discriminatory practices.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moose Lodge is a private club in the ordinary meaning of that term. It is a local chapter of a national fraternal organization having well-defined requirements for membership. It conducts all of its activities in a building that is owned by it. It is not publicly funded. Only members and guests are permitted in any lodge of the order; one may become a guest only by invitation of a member or upon invitation of the house committee.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee, while conceding the right of private clubs to choose members upon a discriminatory basis, asserts that the licensing of Moose Lodge to serve liquor by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board amounts to such state involvement with the club’s activities as to make its discriminatory practices forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has never held, of course, that discrimination by an otherwise private entity would be violative of the Equal Protection Clause if the private entity receives any sort of benefit or service at all from the State, or if it is subject to state regulation in any degree whatever. Since state-furnished services include such necessities of life as electricity, water, and police and fire protection, such a holding would utterly emasculate the distinction between private as distinguished from state conduct set forth in The Civil Rights Cases, and adhered to in subsequent decisions. Our holdings indicate that where the impetus for the discrimination is private, the State must have “significantly involved itself with invidious discriminations,” Reitman v. Mulkey (1967), in order for the discriminatory action to fall within the ambit of the constitutional prohibition.</p>
<p id="fbcd4d63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our prior decisions dealing with discriminatory refusal of service in public eating places are significantly different factually from the case now before us.</p>
<p id="fbcd7474-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here there is nothing approaching the symbiotic relationship between lessor and lessee that was present in <i>Burton</i>, where the private lessee obtained the benefit of locating in a building owned by the state-created parking authority, and the parking authority was enabled to carry out its primary public purpose of furnishing parking space by advantageously leasing portions of the building constructed for that purpose to commercial lessees such as the owner of the Eagle Restaurant. Unlike <i>Burton</i>, the Moose Lodge building is located on land owned by it, not by any public authority. Far from apparently holding itself out as a place of public accommodation, Moose Lodge quite ostentatiously proclaims the fact that it is not open to the public at large. Nor is it located and operated in such surroundings that although private in name, it discharges a function or performs a service that would otherwise in all likelihood be performed by the State. In short, while Eagle was a public restaurant in a public building, Moose Lodge is a private social club in a private building.</p>
<p id="fbcd7475-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the exception hereafter noted, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board plays absolutely no part in establishing or enforcing the membership or guest policies of the club that it licenses to serve liquor. There is no suggestion in <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>this record that Pennsylvania law, either as written or as applied, discriminates against minority groups either in their right to apply for club licenses themselves or in their right to purchase and be served liquor in places of public accommodation.</p>
<p id="fbcd7476-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However detailed the regulation may be in some particulars, it cannot be said to in any way foster or encourage racial discrimination. Nor can it be said to make the State in any realistic sense a partner or even a joint venturer in the club’s enterprise. We therefore hold that the operation of the regulatory scheme enforced by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board does not sufficiently implicate the State in the discriminatory guest policies of Moose Lodge to make the latter “state action” within the ambit of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbcd7478-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he fact that a private club gets some kind of permit from the State or municipality does not make it ipso facto a public enterprise or undertaking, any more than the grant to a householder of a permit to operate an incinerator puts the householder in the public domain. We must, therefore, examine whether there are special circumstances involved in the Pennsylvania scheme which differentiate the liquor license possessed by Moose Lodge from the incinerator permit.</p>
<p id="fbcd7479-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pennsylvania has a state store system of alcohol distribution. Resale is permitted by hotels, restaurants, and private clubs which all must obtain licenses from the Liquor Control Board. The scheme of regulation is complete and pervasive; and the state courts have sustained many restrictions on the licensees. Once a license is issued the licensee must comply with many detailed requirements or risk suspension or revocation of the license. Among these requirements is Regulation §113.09 which says: “Every club licensee shall adhere to all of the provisions of its Constitution and By-laws.” This regulation means, as applied to Moose Lodge, that it must adhere to the racially discriminatory provision of the Constitution of its Supreme Lodge that “[t]he membership of lodges shall be composed of male persons of the Caucasian or White race above the age of twenty-one years, and not married to someone of any other than the Caucasian or White race, who are of good moral character, physically and mentally normal, who shall profess a belief in a Supreme Being.”</p>
<p id="fbcd747a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have held that “a State is responsible for the discriminatory act of a private party when the State, by its law, has compelled the act.” It is irrelevant whether the law is statutory, or an administrative regulation. And it is irrelevant whether the discriminatory act was instigated by the regulation, or was independent of it. The result, as I see it, is the same as though Pennsylvania had put into its liquor licenses a provision that the license may not be used to dispense liquor to blacks, browns, yellows—or atheists or agnostics. Regulation §113.09 is thus an invidious form of state action.</p>
<p id="fbcd747b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were this regulation the only infirmity in Pennsylvania’s licensing scheme, I would perhaps agree with the majority that the appropriate relief would be a decree enjoining its enforcement. But there is another flaw in the scheme not so easily cured. Liquor licenses in Pennsylvania, unlike driver’s licenses, or marriage licenses, are not freely available to those who meet racially neutral qualifications. There is a complex quota system. What the majority neglects to say is that the quota for Harrisburg, where Moose Lodge No. 107 is located, has been full for many years. No more club licenses may be issued in that city.</p>
<p id="fbcd747c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="566" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-566">p. 566</span>This state-enforced scarcity of licenses restricts the ability of blacks to obtain liquor, for liquor is commercially available only at private clubs for a significant portion of each week. Access by blacks to places that serve liquor is further limited by the fact that the state quota is filled. A group desiring to form a nondiscriminatory club which would serve blacks must purchase a license held by an existing club, which can exact a monopoly price for the transfer. The availability of such a license is speculative at best, however, for, as Moose Lodge itself concedes, without a liquor license a fraternal organization would be hard pressed to survive. Thus, the State of Pennsylvania is putting the weight of its liquor license, concededly a valued and important adjunct to a private club, behind racial discrimination.</p>

<p id="fbcd9b95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A three-judge District Court sustained the validity of a Mississippi statutory program under which textbooks are purchased by the State and lent to students in both public and private schools, without reference to whether any participating private school has racially discriminatory policies.</p>
<p id="fbcd9b96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, who are parents of four schoolchildren in Tunica County, Mississippi, filed a class action on behalf of students throughout Mississippi to enjoin in part the enforcement of the Mississippi textbook lending program. The complaint alleged that certain of the private schools excluded students on the basis of race and that, by supplying textbooks to students attending such private schools, appellees, acting for the State, have provided direct state aid to racially segregated education. It was also alleged that the textbook aid program thereby impeded the process of fully desegregating public schools, in violation of appellants’ constitutional rights.</p>
<p id="fbcd9b97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Private schools in Mississippi have experienced a marked growth in recent years. As recently as the 1963-1964 school year, there were only 17 private schools other than Catholic schools; the total enrollment was 2,362 students. In these nonpublic schools 916 students were Negro, and 192 of these were enrolled in special schools for retarded, orphaned, or abandoned children. By September 1970, the number of private non-Catholic schools had increased to 155 with a student population estimated at 42,000, virtually all white. Appellees do not challenge the statement, which is fully documented in appellants’ brief, that “the creation and enlargement of these [private] academies occurred simultaneously with major events in the desegregation of public schools. . . .”</p>
<p id="fbcd9b98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case does not raise any question as to the right of citizens to maintain private schools with admission limited to students of particular national origins, race, or religion or of the authority of a State to allow such schools. See Pierce <span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>v. Society of Sisters (1925). The narrow issue before us, rather, is a particular form of tangible assistance the State provides to students in private schools in common with all other students by lending textbooks under the State’s 33-year-old program for providing free textbooks to all the children of the State. The program dates back to a 1940 appeal for improved educational facilities by the Governor of Mississippi to the state legislature.</p>
<p id="fbcd9b99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellees intimate that the State must provide assistance to private schools equivalent to that which it provides to public schools without regard to whether the private schools discriminate on racial grounds. Clearly, the State need not.</p>
<p id="fbcdc2aa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has consistently affirmed decisions enjoining state tuition grants to students attending racially discriminatory private schools. A textbook lending program is not legally distinguishable from the forms of state assistance foreclosed by the prior cases. Free textbooks, like tuition grants directed to private school students, are a form of financial assistance inuring to the benefit of the private schools themselves. An inescapable educational cost for students in both public and private schools is the expense of providing all necessary learning materials. When, as here, that necessary expense is borne by the State, the economic consequence is to give aid to the enterprise; if the school engages in discriminatory practices the State by tangible aid in the form of textbooks thereby gives support to such discrimination. Racial discrimination in state-operated schools is barred by the Constitution and it is also axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.</p>
<p id="fbcdc2ab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recurring theme of appellees’ argument is a sympathetic one—that the State’s textbook loan program is extended to students who attend racially segregated private schools only because the State sincerely wishes to foster quality education for all Mississippi children, and, to that end, has taken steps to insure that no sub-group of schoolchildren will be deprived of an important educational tool merely because their parents have chosen to enroll them in segregated private schools. We need not assume that the State’s textbook aid to private schools has been motivated by other than a sincere interest in the educational welfare of all Mississippi children. But good intentions as to one valid objective do not serve to negate the State’s involvement in violation of a constitutional duty. “The existence of a permissible purpose cannot sustain an action that has an impermissible effect.” The Equal Protection Clause would be a sterile promise if state involvement in possible private activity could be shielded altogether from constitutional scrutiny simply because its ultimate end was not discrimination but some higher goal. A State’s constitutional obligation requires it to steer clear, not only of operating the old dual system of racially segregated schools, but also of giving significant aid to institutions that practice racial or other invidious discrimination.</p>

<p id="fbcdc2ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, Alabama, 417 U.S. 556 (1974), the Supreme Court held that a city could not give racially segregated private schools exclusive use of public recreational facilities. Montgomery, Alabama, allowed segregated private schools to have exclusive possession of football stadiums, baseball diamonds, basketball courts, and tennis courts for athletic contests and <span title="568" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-568">p. 568</span>other school-sponsored events. The Court found state action because the “city’s actions significantly enhanced the attractiveness of segregated private schools, formed in reaction against the federal court school order, by enabling them to offer complete athletic programs.”</p>
<p id="fbcdc2ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Norwood</i> and <i>Gilmore</i> both involved challenges to state government assistance to segregated private schools in Mississippi and Alabama, states with a long history of school segregation. Outside this context, however, the Court has been unwilling to find government subsidy to be a basis for finding state action. Indeed, the following two more recent cases expressly reject the argument that government subsidy is sufficient for a finding of state action.</p>

<p id="fbcdc2b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent Kohn is the director of the New Perspectives School, a nonprofit institution located on privately owned property in Brookline, Massachusetts. The school was founded as a private institution and is operated by a board of directors, none of whom are public officials or are chosen by public officials. The school specializes in dealing with students who have experienced difficulty completing public high schools; many have drug, alcohol, or behavioral problems, or other special needs. In recent years, nearly all of the students at the school have been referred to it by the Brookline or Boston School Committees, or by the Drug Rehabilitation Division of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health. The school issues high school diplomas certified by the Brookline School Committee.</p>
<p id="fbcde9c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When students are referred to the school by Brookline or Boston under Chapter 766 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1972, the School Committees in those cities pay for the students’ education. The school also receives funds from a number of other state and federal agencies. In recent years, public funds have accounted for at least 90%, and in one year 99%, of respondent school’s operating budget. There were approximately 50 students at the school in those years and none paid tuition.</p>
<p id="fbcde9c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be eligible for tuition funding under Chapter 766, the school must comply with a variety of regulations, many of which are common to all schools. The State has issued detailed regulations concerning matters ranging from recordkeeping to student-teacher ratios. Concerning personnel policies, the Chapter 766 regulations require the school to maintain written job descriptions and written statements describing personnel standards and procedures, but they impose few specific requirements. The school is also regulated by Boston and Brookline as a result of its Chapter 766 funding.</p>
<p id="fbcde9c9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rendell-Baker was discharged by the school in January 1977, and the five other petitioners were discharged in June 1978.

A dispute arose when some students presented a petition to the school’s board of directors in December 1976, seeking greater responsibilities for the student-staff council. Director Kohn opposed the proposal, but Rendell-Baker supported it and so advised the board. On December 13, Kohn notified the State Committee on Criminal Justice, which funded Rendell-Baker’s position, that she intended to dismiss Rendell-Baker and employ someone else. Kohn notified Rendell-Baker of her dismissal in January 1977.</p>
<p id="fbcde9ca-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the spring of 1978, students and staff voiced objections to Kohn’s policies. The five petitioners other than Rendell-Baker, who were all teachers at the school, wrote a letter to the board of directors urging Kohn’s dismissal. When the board affirmed its confidence in Kohn, students from the school picketed the home of the president of the board. The students were threatened with suspension; a local newspaper then ran a story about the controversy at the school. In response to the story, the five petitioners wrote a letter to the editor in which they stated that they thought the prohibition of picketing was unconstitutional. On the day the letter to the editor appeared, the five teachers told the president of the board that they were forming a union. Kohn discharged the teachers the next day. They brought suit against the school and its directors in December 1978.</p>
<p id="fbcde9cb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners allege that respondents violated 42 U.S.C. §1983 by discharging them because of their exercise of their First Amendment right of free speech and without the process due them under the Fourteenth Amendment. The core issue presented in this case is not whether petitioners were discharged because of their speech or without adequate procedural protections, but whether the school’s action in discharging them can fairly be seen as state action. If the action of the respondent school is not state action, our inquiry ends.</p>
<p id="fbcde9cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school is not fundamentally different from many private corporations whose business depends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government. Acts of such private contractors do not become acts of the government by reason of their significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts.</p>
<p id="fbcde9cd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here the decisions to discharge the petitioners were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation. Indeed, in contrast to the extensive regulation of the school generally, the various regulators showed relatively little interest in the school’s personnel matters. The most intrusive personnel regulation promulgated by the various government agencies was the requirement that the Committee on Criminal Justice had the power to approve persons hired as vocational counselors. Such a regulation is not sufficient to make a decision to discharge, made by private management, state action.</p>
<p id="fbcde9ce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Petitioners] assert that the school is a state actor [in] that it performs a “public function.” However, our holdings have made clear that the relevant question is not simply whether a private group is serving a “public function.” We have held that the question is whether the function performed has been “traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.” Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. There can be no doubt that the education of maladjusted high school students is a public function, but that is only the beginning of the inquiry. Chapter 766 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1972 demonstrates that the State intends to provide services for such students at public expense. That legislative policy choice in no way makes these services the exclusive province of the State. Indeed, the Court of Appeals noted that until recently the State had not undertaken to provide <span title="570" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-570">p. 570</span>education for students who could not be served by traditional public schools.

The Court today holds that their suits must be dismissed because the school did not act “under color” of state law. According to the majority, the decision of the school to discharge petitioners cannot fairly be regarded as a decision of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In my view, this holding simply cannot be justified. The State has delegated to the New Perspectives School its statutory duty to educate children with special needs. The school receives almost all of its funds from the State, and is heavily regulated. This nexus between the school and the State is so substantial that the school’s action must be considered state action. I therefore dissent.</p>
<p id="fbcde9d1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decisions of this Court clearly establish that where there is a symbiotic relationship between the State and a privately owned enterprise, so that the State and a privately owned enterprise are participants in a joint venture, the actions of the private enterprise may be attributable to the State. “Conduct that is formally ‘private’ may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character” that it can be regarded as governmental action. Evans v. Newton.</p>
<p id="fbcde9d2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New Perspectives School receives virtually all of its funds from state sources. This financial dependence on the State is an important indicium of governmental involvement. The school’s very survival depends on the State. If the State chooses, it may exercise complete control over the school’s operations simply by threatening to withdraw financial support if the school takes action that it considers objectionable.</p>
<p id="fbcde9d3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school is heavily regulated and closely supervised by the State. This fact provides further support for the conclusion that its actions should be attributed to the State. When an entity is not only heavily regulated and funded by the State, but also provides a service that the State is required to provide, there is a very close nexus with the State. Under these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate to treat the entity as an arm of the State. Here, since the New Perspectives School exists solely to fulfill the State’s obligations under Chapter 766, I think it fully reasonable to conclude that the school is a state actor.</p>
<p id="fbcde9d4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority repeatedly compares the school to a private contractor that “depends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government.” The New Perspectives School can be readily distinguished, however. Although shipbuilders and dambuilders, like the school, may be dependent on government funds, they are not so closely supervised by the government. And unlike most private contractors, the school is performing a statutory duty of the State.</p>
<p id="fbce10e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though there are myriad indicia of state action in this case, the majority refuses to find that the school acted under color of state law when it discharged petitioners. The decision in this case marks a return to empty formalism in state action doctrine. Because I believe that the state action requirement must <span title="571" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-571">p. 571</span>be given a more sensitive and flexible interpretation than the majority offers, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbce10e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982), there was a strong argument that the government’s funding of Medicaid patients caused their transfer to other less well-equipped facilities. State policy required that private facilities receiving Medicaid funding create “utilization review committees” to determine the level of care needed. After a decision from a utilization review committee, the state would terminate its Medicaid payments for patients unless they were transferred from “skilled nursing facilities” to “health related facilities.” Because the state paid over 90 percent of the medical expenses for the patients, its decision clearly was responsible for the transfer decisions. The patients argued that they should be given due process with regard to their transfer.</p>
<p id="fbce10e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, however, ruled that there was not state action because it was the decision of the private nursing home to transfer the patients. The Court found neither the extent of state regulation nor the size of state funding to be a basis for finding state action. Furthermore, the Court found that the state financial incentives for the transfers were insufficient to constitute state action. The Court said that “a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.”</p>
<p id="fbce10e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Brennan wrote a dissent emphasizing the responsibility of the state in causing these decisions about patients:</p>

<p id="fbce10e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ignoring the State’s fiscal interest in the level-of-care determination, the Court proceeds to a cursory, and misleading, discussion of the State’s involvement in the assignment of residents to particular levels of care. In my view, an accurate and realistic appraisal of the procedures actually employed in the State of New York leaves no doubt that not only has the State established the system of treatment levels and utilization review in order to further its own fiscal goals, but that the State prescribes with as much precision as is possible the standards by which individual determinations are to be made. There can thus be little doubt that in the vast majority of cases, decisions as to “level of treatment” in the admission process are made according to the State’s specified criteria.</p>
<p id="fbce10ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The degree of interdependence between the State and the nursing home is far more pronounced than it was between the State and the private entity in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority (1961). The State subsidizes practically all of the operating and capital costs of the facility, and pays the medical expenses of more than 90% of its residents. And, in setting reimbursement rates, the State generally affords the nursing homes a profit as well. Even more striking is the fact that the residents of those homes are, by definition, utterly dependent on the State for their support and their placement.</p>

<p id="fbce10ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the preceding material indicates, the Supreme Court has recognized two narrow exceptions to the state action requirement: the public functions exception, which provides that private conduct must comply with the Constitution when it is performing a task that has traditionally been done exclusively by <span title="572" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-572">p. 572</span>the government; and the entanglement exception, in which the government affirmatively authorizes, encourages, or facilitates unconstitutional conduct. In Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., the Court finds that a private entity is a state actor based on its “entwinement” with the government. The key question, not answered by the Court, is how “entwinement” relates to “entanglement.” Is this a new exception to the state action requirement? If so, how is it different? Is it that entanglement requires government encouragement, but entwinement does not? None of these questions is addressed by the Court, but they will undoubtedly be litigated in the future and are thus ones to consider as you read this decision.</p>

<p id="fbce3804-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue is whether a statewide association incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private secondary schools may be regarded as engaging in state action when it enforces a rule against a member school. The association in question here includes most public schools located within the State, acts through their representatives, draws its officers from them, is largely funded by their dues and income received in their stead, and has historically been seen to regulate in lieu of the State Board of Education’s exercise of its own authority. We hold that the association’s regulatory activity may and should be treated as state action owing to the pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the structure of the association, there being no offsetting reason to see the association’s acts in any other way.</p>

<p id="fbce3806-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (Association) is a not-for-profit membership corporation organized to regulate interscholastic sport among the public and private high schools in Tennessee that belong to it. No school is forced to join, but without any other authority actually regulating interscholastic athletics, it enjoys the memberships of almost all the State’s public high schools (some 290 of them or 84% of the Association’s voting membership), far outnumbering the 55 private schools that belong. A member school’s team may play or scrimmage only against the team of another member, absent a dispensation.</p>
<p id="fbce3807-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Association’s rulemaking arm is its legislative council, while its board of control tends to administration. The voting membership of each of these nine-person committees is limited under the Association’s bylaws to high school principals, assistant principals, and superintendents elected by the member schools, and the public school administrators who so serve typically attend meetings during regular school hours. Although the Association’s staff members are not paid by the State, they are eligible to join the State’s public retirement system for its employees. Member schools pay dues to the Association, though the bulk of its revenue is gate receipts at member teams’ football and basketball tournaments, many of them held in public arenas rented by the Association.</p>
<p id="fbce3808-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="573" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-573">p. 573</span>The constitution, bylaws, and rules of the Association set standards of school membership and the eligibility of students to play in interscholastic games. Each school, for example, is regulated in awarding financial aid, most coaches must have a Tennessee state teaching license, and players must meet minimum academic standards and hew to limits on student employment. Under the bylaws, “in all matters pertaining to the athletic relations of his school,” the principal is responsible to the Association, which has the power “to suspend, to fine, or otherwise penalize any member school for the violation of any of the rules of the Association or for other just cause.”</p>
<p id="fbce3809-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ever since the Association was incorporated in 1925, Tennessee’s State Board of Education (State Board) has (to use its own words) acknowledged the corporation’s functions “in providing standards, rules and regulations for interscholastic competition in the public schools of Tennessee.” Specifically, in 1972, it went so far as to adopt a rule expressly “designat[ing]” the Association as “the organization to supervise and regulate the athletic activities in which the public junior and senior high schools in Tennessee participate on an interscholastic basis.” [O]n several occasions over the next 20 years, the State Board reviewed, approved, or reaffirmed its approval of the recruiting Rule at issue in this case. In 1996, however, the State Board dropped the original Rule expressly designating the Association as regulator; it substituted a statement “recogniz[ing] the value of participation in interscholastic athletics and the role of [the Association] in coordinating interscholastic athletic competition,” while “authoriz[ing] the public schools of the state to voluntarily maintain membership in [the Association].”</p>
<p id="fbce380a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The action before us responds to a 1997 regulatory enforcement proceeding brought against petitioner, Brentwood Academy, a private parochial high school member of the Association. The Association’s board of control found that Brentwood violated a rule prohibiting “undue influence” in recruiting athletes, when it wrote to incoming students and their parents about spring football practice. The Association accordingly placed Brentwood’s athletic program on probation for four years, declared its football and boys’ basketball teams ineligible to compete in playoffs for two years, and imposed a $3,000 fine. When these penalties were imposed, all the voting members of the board of control and legislative council were public school administrators.</p>
<p id="fbce380b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brentwood sued the Association and its executive director in federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, claiming that enforcement of the Rule was state action and a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

<p id="fbce380e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases try to plot a line between state action subject to Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny and private conduct (however exceptionable) that is not. The judicial obligation is not only to “‘preserv[e] an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law’ and avoi[d] the imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control,” but also to assure that constitutional standards are invoked “when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.” If the Fourteenth <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>Amendment is not to be displaced, therefore, its ambit cannot be a simple line between States and people operating outside formally governmental organizations, and the deed of an ostensibly private organization or individual is to be treated sometimes as if a State had caused it to be performed. Thus, we say that state action may be found if, though only if, there is such a “close nexus between the State and the challenged action” that seemingly private behavior “may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.”</p>
<p id="fbce5f1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is fairly attributable is a matter of normative judgment, and the criteria lack rigid simplicity. From the range of circumstances that could point toward the State behind an individual face, no one fact can function as a necessary condition across the board for finding state action; nor is any set of circumstances absolutely sufficient, for there may be some countervailing reason against attributing activity to the government.</p>
<p id="fbce5f20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases have identified a host of facts that can bear on the fairness of such an attribution. We have, for example, held that a challenged activity may be state action when it results from the State’s exercise of “coercive power,” when the State provides “significant encouragement, either overt or covert,” or when a private actor operates as a “willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents.” We have treated a nominally private entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an “agency of the State,” when it has been delegated a public function by the State, when it is “entwined with governmental policies” or when government is “entwined in [its] management or control.”</p>
<p id="fbce5f21-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Amidst such variety, examples may be the best teachers, and examples from our cases are unequivocal in showing that the character of a legal entity is determined neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law, nor by the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity’s inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies.</p>
<p id="fbce5f22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">NCAA v. Tarkanian (1988) arose when an undoubtedly state actor, the University of Nevada, suspended its basketball coach, Tarkanian, in order to comply with rules and recommendations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The coach charged the NCAA with state action, arguing that the state university had delegated its own functions to the NCAA, clothing the latter with authority to make and apply the university’s rules, the result being joint action making the NCAA a state actor.</p>
<p id="fbce5f23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, it is not the strict holding in <i>Tarkanian</i> that points to our view of this case, for we found no state action on the part of the NCAA. We could see, on the one hand, that the university had some part in setting the NCAA’s rules, and the Supreme Court of Nevada had gone so far as to hold that the NCAA had been delegated the university’s traditionally exclusive public authority over personnel. But on the other side, the NCAA’s policies were shaped not by the University of Nevada alone, but by several hundred member institutions, most of them having no connection with Nevada, and exhibiting no color of Nevada law. Since it was difficult to see the NCAA, not as a collective membership, but as surrogate for the one State, we held the organization’s connection with Nevada too insubstantial to ground a state action claim.</p>
<p id="fbce5f24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But dictum in <i>Tarkanian</i> pointed to a contrary result on facts like ours, with an organization whose member public schools are all within a single State. “The situation would, of course, be different if the [Association’s] membership consisted entirely of institutions located within the same State, many of them public institutions created by the same sovereign.”</p>

The nominally private character of the Association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.</p>
<p id="fbce5f27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Association is not an organization of natural persons acting on their own, but of schools, and of public schools to the extent of 84% of the total. Under the Association’s bylaws, each member school is represented by its principal or a faculty member, who has a vote in selecting members of the governing legislative council and board of control from eligible principals, assistant principals and superintendents.</p>
<p id="fbce5f28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, to the extent of 84% of its membership, the Association is an organization of public schools represented by their officials acting in their official capacity to provide an integral element of secondary public schooling. There would be no recognizable Association, legal or tangible, without the public school officials, who do not merely control but overwhelmingly perform all but the purely ministerial acts by which the Association exists and functions in practical terms. Only the 16% minority of private school memberships prevents this entwinement of the Association and the public school system from being total and their identities totally indistinguishable.</p>
<p id="fbce5f29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To complement the entwinement of public school officials with the Association from the bottom up, the State of Tennessee has provided for entwinement from top down. State Board members are assigned ex officio to serve as members of the board of control and legislative council, and the Association’s ministerial employees are treated as state employees to the extent of being eligible for membership in the state retirement system.</p>

The majority’s holding—that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association’s (TSSAA) enforcement of its recruiting rule is state action—not only extends state-action doctrine beyond its permissible limits but also encroaches upon the realm of individual freedom that the doctrine was meant to protect.

<p id="fbce5f2d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state-action element of 42 U.S.C. §1983 excludes from its coverage “merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.” “Careful adherence to the ‘state action’ requirement” thus “preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power.” The state-action doctrine also promotes important values of federalism, “avoid[ing] the imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control.” Although we have <span title="576" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-576">p. 576</span>used many different tests to identify state action, they all have a common purpose.

<p id="fbce853f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless of these various tests for state action, common sense dictates that the TSSAA’s actions cannot fairly be attributed to the State, and thus cannot constitute state action. The TSSAA was formed in 1925 as a private corporation to organize interscholastic athletics and to sponsor tournaments among its member schools. Any private or public secondary school may join the TSSAA by signing a contract agreeing to comply with its rules and decisions. Although public schools currently compose 84% of the TSSAA’s membership, the TSSAA does not require that public schools constitute a set percentage of its membership, and, indeed, no public school need join the TSSAA. The TSSAA’s rules are enforced not by a state agency but by its own board of control, which comprises high school principals, assistant principals, and superintendents, none of whom must work at a public school. Of course, at the time the recruiting rule was enforced in this case, all of the board members happened to be public school officials. However, each board member acts in a representative capacity on behalf of all the private and public schools in his region of Tennessee, and not simply his individual school.</p>
<p id="fbce8540-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Tennessee did not create the TSSAA. The State does not fund the TSSAA and does not pay its employees. In fact, only 4% of the TSSAA’s revenue comes from the dues paid by member schools; the bulk of its operating budget is derived from gate receipts at tournaments it sponsors. The State does not permit the TSSAA to use state-owned facilities for a discounted fee, and it does not exempt the TSSAA from state taxation. No Tennessee law authorizes the State to coordinate interscholastic athletics or empowers another entity to organize interscholastic athletics on behalf of the State. The only state pronouncement acknowledging the TSSAA’s existence is a rule providing that the State Board of Education permits public schools to maintain membership in the TSSAA if they so choose.</p>
<p id="fbce8541-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the State of Tennessee has never had any involvement in the particular action taken by the TSSAA in this case: the enforcement of the TSSAA’s recruiting rule prohibiting members from using “undue influence” on students or their parents or guardians “to secure or to retain a student for athletic purposes.” There is no indication that the State has ever had any interest in how schools choose to regulate recruiting. In fact, the TSSAA’s authority to enforce its recruiting rule arises solely from the voluntary membership contract that each member school signs, agreeing to conduct its athletics in accordance with the rules and decisions of the TSSAA.</p>

<p id="fbce8543-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even approaching the issue in terms of any of the Court’s specific state-action tests, the conclusion is the same: The TSSAA’s enforcement of its recruiting rule against Brentwood Academy is not state action. The TSSAA has not performed a function that has been “traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.” Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. (1974). The organization of interscholastic sports is neither a traditional nor an exclusive public function of the States. Widespread organization and administration of interscholastic contests by schools did not <span title="577" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-577">p. 577</span>begin until the 20th century. Indeed, no one claims that the State of Tennessee played any role in the creation of the TSSAA as a private corporation in 1925. The TSSAA was designed to fulfill an objective—the organization of interscholastic athletic tournaments—that the government had not contemplated, much less pursued. And although the board of control currently is composed of public school officials, and although public schools currently account for the majority of the TSSAA’s membership, this is not required by the TSSAA’s constitution.</p>
<p id="fbce8544-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the State of Tennessee has not “exercised coercive power or . . . provided such significant encouragement [to the TSSAA], either overt or covert,” that the TSSAA’s regulatory activities must in law be deemed to be those of the State. The State has not promulgated any regulations of interscholastic sports, and nothing in the record suggests that the State has encouraged or coerced the TSSAA in enforcing its recruiting rule. To be sure, public schools do provide a small portion of the TSSAA’s funding through their membership dues, but no one argues that these dues are somehow conditioned on the TSSAA’s enactment and enforcement of recruiting rules. Likewise, even if the TSSAA were dependent on state funding to the extent of 90%, instead of less than 4%, mere financial dependence on the State does not convert the TSSAA’s actions into acts of the State.</p>
<p id="fbce8545-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, there is no “symbiotic relationship” between the State and the TSSAA. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, the TSSAA’s “fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government.” The TSSAA provides a service—the organization of athletic tournaments—in exchange for membership dues and gate fees, just as a vendor could contract with public schools to sell refreshments at school events. Certainly the public school could sell its own refreshments, yet the existence of that option does not transform the service performed by the contractor into a state action. Also, there is no suggestion in this case that, as was the case in <i>Burton</i>, the State profits from the TSSAA’s decision to enforce its recruiting rule.</p>
<p id="fbce8546-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I do not believe that the TSSAA’s action of enforcing its recruiting rule is fairly attributable to the State of Tennessee, I would affirm.</p>

<p id="fbce8548-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the TSSAA’s enforcement activities cannot be considered state action as a matter of common sense or under any of this Court’s existing theories of state action, the majority presents a new theory. Under this theory, the majority holds that the combination of factors it identifies evidences “entwinement” of the State with the TSSAA, and that such entwinement converts private action into state action. The majority does not define “entwinement,” and the meaning of the term is not altogether clear. But whatever this new “entwinement” theory may entail, it lacks any support in our state-action jurisprudence. There is no case in which we have rested a finding of state action on entwinement alone.</p>
<p id="fbce8549-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the majority never defines “entwinement,” the scope of its holding is unclear. If we are fortunate, the majority’s fact-specific analysis will have little bearing beyond this case. But if the majority’s new entwinement test develops in future years, it could affect many organizations that foster activities, enforce rules, and sponsor extracurricular competition among high schools—not just in athletics, but in such diverse areas as agriculture, mathematics, music, marching <span title="578" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-578">p. 578</span>bands, forensics, and cheerleading. Indeed, this entwinement test may extend to other organizations that are composed of, or controlled by, public officials or public entities, such as firefighters, policemen, teachers, cities, or counties. I am not prepared to say that any private organization that permits public entities and public officials to participate acts as the State in anything or everything it does, and our state-action jurisprudence has never reached that far. The state-action doctrine was developed to reach only those actions that are truly attributable to the State, not to subject private citizens to the control of federal courts hearing §1983 actions. I respectfully dissent.</p>
