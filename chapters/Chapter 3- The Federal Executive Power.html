<p id="fba21ea7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter examines the powers of the presidency and the executive branch. It particularly focuses on the tensions between the executive and legislative powers. The previous chapter examines the federal legislative power in relationship to state governments. This chapter, in contrast, centers on the relationship between two branches of the federal government.</p>
<p id="fba21ea8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Six topics are examined. First, section A focuses on the issue of inherent presidential power and the question of when, if at all, the president may act without constitutional or statutory authority. The issue of executive privilege is considered as an example of this controversy.</p>
<p id="fba21ea9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, section B considers the constitutional problems posed by administrative agencies. The section begins by considering the nondelegation doctrine and its demise and then examines the legislative veto as a possible alternative check on administrative agencies. In light of the demise of the legislative veto, the chapter then considers other alternative checks on agencies, including the use of the removal power.</p>
<p id="fba21eaa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, section C looks at the allocation of decision-making authority in the area of foreign policy. In particular, responsibilities with regard to treaties and war powers are considered.</p>
<p id="fba21eab-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, section D examines executive power and the war on terrorism.</p>
<p id="fba21eac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fifth, section E looks at executive power with regard to immigration.</p>
<p id="fba21ead-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, section F concludes by examining checks on the executive, including civil suits for money damages and impeachment.</p>

<p id="fba21eb0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When, if ever, may the president act without express constitutional or statutory authorization? If the president has explicit constitutional authority for particular conduct, then the issues are solely whether the president is acting within the scope of the granted power and whether the president is violating some other constitutional provision. If there is a statute authorizing the president’s conduct, then the question is whether that law is constitutional. But what if there is neither constitutional nor statutory authority?</p>
<p id="fba245c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="276" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-276">p. 276</span>The debate over this question began in the earliest days of the nation and had impeccable authorities on each side of the dispute. Early in the presidency of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison clashed over this issue and whether the president could issue a neutrality proclamation as to a war occurring between England and France. Alexander Hamilton argued that the difference in the wording of Articles I and II reveals the framers’ intention to create inherent presidential powers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004F_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1004F_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">1</a></span> Article I initially states, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” Article II of the Constitution begins, “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” Because Article II does not limit the president to powers “herein granted,” Hamilton argued that the president has authority not specifically delineated in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fba245c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others, beginning with James Madison,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1005F_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1005F_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">2</a></span> have disputed this interpretation of Article II, contending that the opening language of Article II was “simply to settle the question whether the executive branch should be plural or single and to give the executive a title.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1006B_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N1006B_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">3</a></span> According to this position, the president has no powers that are not enumerated in Article II and, indeed, such unenumerated authority would be inconsistent with a Constitution creating a government of limited authority.</p>
<p id="fba245c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The leading Supreme Court decision concerning this issue is Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer.

<p id="fba245cc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Black</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fba26cdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are asked to decide whether the President was acting within his constitutional power when he issued an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the Nation’s steel mills. The mill owners argue that the President’s order amounts to lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. The Government’s position is that the order was made on findings of the President that his action was necessary to avert a national catastrophe which would inevitably result from a stoppage of steel production, and that in meeting this grave emergency the President was acting within the aggregate of his constitutional powers as the Nation’s Chief Executive and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. The issue emerges here from the following series of events:</p>
<p id="fba26cde-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-277">p. 277</span>In the latter part of 1951, a dispute arose between the steel companies and their employees over terms and conditions that should be included in new collective bargaining agreements. Long-continued conferences failed to resolve the dispute. On December 18, 1951, the employees’ representative, United Steelworkers of America, C.I.O., gave notice of an intention to strike when the existing bargaining agreements expired on December 31. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service then intervened in an effort to get labor and management to agree. This failing, the President on December 22, 1951, referred the dispute to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board to investigate and make recommendations for fair and equitable terms of settlement. This Board’s report resulted in no settlement. On April 4, 1952, the Union gave notice of a nationwide strike called to begin at 12:01 <span class="epub-small-caps">a.m.</span> April 9. The indispensability of steel as a component of substantially all weapons and other war materials led the President to believe that the proposed work stoppage would immediately jeopardize our national defense and that governmental seizure of the steel mills was necessary in order to assure the continued availability of steel. Reciting these considerations for his action, the President, a few hours before the strike was to begin, issued Executive Order 10340. The order directed the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running. The Secretary immediately issued his own possessory orders, calling upon the presidents of the various seized companies to serve as operating managers for the United States. They were directed to carry on their activities in accordance with regulations and directions of the Secretary. The next morning the President sent a message to Congress reporting his action. Twelve days later he sent a second message. Congress has taken no action.</p>
<p id="fba26cdf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obeying the Secretary’s orders under protest, the companies brought proceedings against him in the District Court. Their complaints charged that the seizure was not authorized by an act of Congress or by any constitutional provisions.</p>
<p id="fba26ce0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President’s power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself. There is no statute that expressly authorizes the President to take possession of property as he did here. Nor is there any act of Congress to which our attention has been directed from which such a power can fairly be implied. Indeed, we do not understand the Government to rely on statutory authorization for this seizure. There are two statutes which do authorize the President to take both personal and real property under certain conditions. However, the Government admits that these conditions were not met and that the President’s order was not rooted in either of the statutes.</p>
<p id="fba26ce1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the use of the seizure technique to solve labor disputes in order to prevent work stoppages was not only unauthorized by any congressional enactment; prior to this controversy, Congress had refused to adopt that method of settling labor disputes. When the Taft-Hartley Act was under consideration in 1947, Congress rejected an amendment which would have authorized such governmental seizures in cases of emergency. Apparently it was thought that the technique of seizure, like that of compulsory arbitration, would interfere with the process of collective bargaining. Consequently, the plan Congress adopted in that Act did not provide for seizure under any circumstances. Instead, the plan sought to bring about settlements by use of the customary devices of mediation, conciliation, investigation by boards of inquiry, and public reports. In some <span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>instances temporary injunctions were authorized to provide cooling-off periods. All this failing, unions were left free to strike after a secret vote by employees as to whether they wished to accept their employers’ final settlement offer.</p>
<p id="fba26ce2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it must be found in some provisions of the Constitution. And it is not claimed that express constitutional language grants this power to the President. The contention is that presidential power should be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Particular reliance is placed on provisions in Article II which say that “the executive Power shall be vested in a President . . .”; that “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”; and that he “shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fba26ce3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Government attempts to do so by citing a number of cases upholding broad powers in military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater of war. Such cases need not concern us here. Even though “theater of war” be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.</p>
<p id="fba26ce4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional provisions that grant executive power to the President. In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute.</p>
<p id="fba26ce5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the Congress alone in both good and bad times. It would do no good to recall the historical events, the fears of power and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their choice. Such a review would but confirm our holding that this seizure order cannot stand.</p>
<p id="fba26ce6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Jackson,</span> concurring in the judgment and opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="fba26ce7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That comprehensive and undefined presidential powers hold both practical advantages and grave dangers for the country will impress anyone who has served as legal adviser to a President in time of transition and public anxiety. A judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually present themselves. Just what our forefathers did envision, or would have envisioned had they foreseen modern conditions, must be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the dreams Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharaoh. A century and a half of partisan debate and scholarly speculation yields no net result but only supplies more or less apt quotations from respected sources on each side of any question. They largely cancel each other. And court decisions are indecisive because of the judicial practice of dealing with the largest questions in the most narrow way.</p>
<p id="fba26ce8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We may well begin by a somewhat over-simplified grouping of practical situations in which a President may doubt, or others may challenge, his powers, and by distinguishing roughly the legal consequences of this factor of relativity.</p>
<p id="fba26ce9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-279">p. 279</span>1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth), to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government as an undivided whole lacks power. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.</p>
<p id="fba26cea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not invite, measures of independent presidential responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law.</p>
<p id="fba26ceb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject. Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.</p>
<p id="fba293fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Into which of these classifications does this executive seizure of the steel industry fit? It is eliminated from the first by admission, for it is conceded that no congressional authorization exists for this seizure. That takes away also the support of the many precedents and declarations which were made in relation, and must be confined, to this category.</p>
<p id="fba293fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can it then be defended under flexible tests available to the second category? It seems clearly eliminated from that class because Congress has not left seizure of private property an open field but has covered it by three statutory policies inconsistent with this seizure.</p>
<p id="fba293fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This leaves the current seizure to be justified only by the severe tests under the third grouping, where it can be supported only by any remainder of executive power after subtraction of such powers as Congress may have over the subject. In short, we can sustain the President only by holding that seizure of such strike-bound industries is within his domain and beyond control by Congress. Thus, this Court’s first review of such seizures occurs under circumstances which leave Presidential power most vulnerable to attack and in the least favorable of possible constitutional postures.</p>
<p id="fba293ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The clause on which the Government relies is that “The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. . . .” These cryptic words have given rise to some of the most persistent controversies in our constitutional history. Assuming that we are in a war de facto, whether it is or is not a war de jure, does that empower the Commander-in-Chief to seize industries he thinks necessary to supply our army? The Constitution expressly places in Congress power “to raise and support Armies” and “to provide and maintain a Navy.” This certainly lays upon Congress primary responsibility for <span title="280" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-280">p. 280</span>supplying the armed forces. Congress alone controls the raising of revenues and their appropriation and may determine in what manner and by what means they shall be spent for military and naval procurement. I suppose no one would doubt that Congress can take over war supply as a Government enterprise. On the other hand, if Congress sees fit to rely on free private enterprise collectively bargaining with free labor for support and maintenance of our armed forces, can the Executive because of lawful disagreements incidental to that process, seize the facility for operation upon Government-imposed terms?</p>
<p id="fba29400-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are indications that the Constitution did not contemplate that the title Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy will constitute him also Commander-in-Chief of the country, its industries and its inhabitants. He has no monopoly of “war powers,” whatever they are. While Congress cannot deprive the President of the command of the army and navy, only Congress can provide him an army or navy to command. That military powers of the Commander-in-Chief were not to supersede representative government of internal affairs seems obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American history.</p>
<p id="fba29401-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The executive action we have here originates in the individual will of the President and represents an exercise of authority without law. No one, perhaps not even the President, knows the limits of the power he may seek to exert in this instance and the parties affected cannot learn the limit of their rights. We do not know today what powers over labor or property would be claimed to flow from Government possession if we should legalize it, what rights to compensation would be claimed or recognized, or on what contingency it would end. With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations. Such institutions may be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of the Court to be last, not first, to give them up.</p>

<p id="fba29403-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no doubt that the emergency which caused the President to seize these steel plants was one that bore heavily on the country. But the emergency did not create power; it merely marked an occasion when power should be exercised. And the fact that it was necessary that measures be taken to keep steel in production does not mean that the President, rather than the Congress, had the constitutional authority to act. The Congress, as well as the President, is trustee of the national welfare. The President can act more quickly than the Congress. The President with the armed services at his disposal can move with force as well as with speed. All executive power — from the reign of ancient kings to the rule of modern dictators — has the outward appearance of efficiency.</p>
<p id="fba29404-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legislative power, by contrast, is slower to exercise. There must be delay while the ponderous machinery of committees, hearings, and debates is put into motion. That takes time; and while the Congress slowly moves into action, the emergency may take its toll in wages, consumer goods, war production, the standard of living of the people, and perhaps even lives. Legislative action may indeed often be cumbersome, time-consuming, and apparently inefficient. But as Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his dissent in Myers v. United States:</p><span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-281">p. 281</span>

<p id="fba29405-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy.</p>
</div>
<p id="fba29406-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore cannot decide this case by determining which branch of government can deal most expeditiously with the present crisis. The answer must depend on the allocation of powers under the Constitution. That in turn requires an analysis of the conditions giving rise to the seizure and of the seizure itself.</p>
<p id="fba29407-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative nature of the action taken by the President seems to me to be clear. When the United States takes over an industrial plant to settle a labor controversy, it is condemning property. The seizure of the plant is a taking in the constitutional sense. A permanent taking would amount to the nationalization of the industry. A temporary taking falls short of that goal. But though the seizure is only for a week or a month, the condemnation is complete and the United States must pay compensation for the temporary possession.</p>
<p id="fba29408-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President has no power to raise revenues. That power is in the Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The President might seize and the Congress by subsequent action might ratify the seizure. But until and unless Congress acted, no condemnation would be lawful. The branch of government that has the power to pay compensation for a seizure is the only one able to authorize a seizure or make lawful one that the President had effected. That seems to me to be the necessary result of the condemnation provision in the Fifth Amendment. It squares with the theory of checks and balances expounded by Mr. Justice Black in the opinion of the Court in which I join.</p>
<p id="fba29409-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Frankfurter,</span> concurring.</p>
<p id="fba2940a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must therefore put to one side consideration of what powers the President would have had if there had been no legislation whatever bearing on the authority asserted by the seizure, or if the seizure had been only for a short, explicitly temporary period, to be terminated automatically unless Congressional approval were given. These and other questions, like or unlike, are not now here. I would exceed my authority were I to say anything about them.</p>
<p id="fba2940b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before the Court comes in this setting. Congress has frequently — at least 16 times since 1916 — specifically provided for executive seizure of production, transportation, communications, or storage facilities. In every case it has qualified this grant of power with limitations and safeguards. The power to seize has uniformly been given only for a limited period or for a defined emergency, or has been repealed after a short period. Its exercise has been restricted to particular circumstances such as “time of war or when war is imminent,” the needs of “public safety” or of “national security or defense,” or “urgent and impending need.” The period of governmental operation has been limited, as, for instance, to “sixty days after the restoration of productive efficiency.” Congress also has not left to implication that just compensation be paid: it has usually legislated in detail regarding enforcement of this litigation-breeding general requirement.</p>
<p id="fba2bb1c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress in 1947 was again called upon to consider whether governmental seizure should be used to avoid serious industrial shutdowns. Congress decided against conferring such power generally and in advance, without special congressional enactment to meet each particular need. Under the urgency of <span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>telephone and coal strikes in the winter of 1946, Congress addressed itself to the problems raised by “national emergency” strikes and lockouts. The termination of wartime seizure powers on December 31, 1946, brought these matters to the attention of Congress with vivid impact. A proposal that the President be given powers to seize plants to avert a shutdown where the “health or safety” of the nation was endangered, was thoroughly canvassed by Congress and rejected. No room for doubt remains that the proponents as well as the opponents of the bill which became the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 clearly understood that as a result of that legislation the only recourse for preventing a shutdown in any basic industry, after failure of mediation, was Congress. Authorization for seizure as an available remedy for potential dangers was unequivocally put aside. An amendment presented in the House providing that where necessary “to preserve and protect the public health and security” the President might seize any industry in which there is an impending curtailment of production, was voted down after debate, by a vote of more than three to one.</p>
<p id="fba2bb1d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[N]othing can be plainer than that Congress made a conscious choice of policy in a field full of perplexity and peculiarly within legislative responsibility for choice. In formulating legislation for dealing with industrial conflicts, Congress could not more clearly and emphatically have withheld authority than it did in 1947. Perhaps as much so as is true of any piece of modern legislation, Congress acted with full consciousness of what it was doing and in the light of much recent history. Previous seizure legislation had subjected the powers granted to the President to restrictions of varying degrees of stringency. Instead of giving him even limited powers, Congress in 1947 deemed it wise to require the President, upon failure of attempts to reach a voluntary settlement, to report to Congress if he deemed the power of seizure a needed shot for his locker. The President could not ignore the specific limitations of prior seizure statutes. No more could he act in disregard of the limitation put upon seizure by the 1947 Act.</p>
<p id="fba2bb1e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be contended that the President would have had power to issue this order had Congress explicitly negated such authority in formal legislation. Congress has expressed its will to withhold this power from the President as though it had said so in so many words.</p>
<p id="fba2bb1f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deeply embedded traditional ways of conducting government cannot supplant the Constitution or legislation, but they give meaning to the words of a text or supply them. It is an inadmissibly narrow conception of American constitutional law to confine it to the words of the Constitution and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon them. In short, a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the Constitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of the structure of our government, may be treated as a gloss on “executive Power” vested in the President by §1 of Art. II. Down to the World War II period, then, the record is barren of instances comparable to the one before us.</p>
<p id="fba2bb20-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A scheme of government like ours no doubt at times feels the lack of power to act with complete, all-embracing, swiftly moving authority. No doubt a government with distributed authority, subject to be challenged in the courts of law, at least long enough to consider and adjudicate the challenge, labors under restrictions from which other governments are free. It has not been our tradition to envy such governments. In any event our government was designed to <span title="283" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-283">p. 283</span>have such restrictions.

<p id="fba2bb22-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President of the United States directed the Secretary of Commerce to take temporary possession of the Nation’s steel mills during the existing emergency because “a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense and the defense of those joined with us in resisting aggression, and would add to the continuing danger of our soldiers, sailors and airmen engaged in combat in the field.”</p>
<p id="fba2bb23-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In passing upon the question of Presidential powers in this case, we must first consider the context in which those powers were exercised. Those who suggest that this is a case involving extraordinary powers should be mindful that these are extraordinary times. A world not yet recovered from the devastation of World War II has been forced to face the threat of another and more terrifying global conflict.</p>
<p id="fba2bb24-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1950, when the United Nations called upon member nations “to render every assistance” to repel aggression in Korea, the United States furnished its vigorous support. For almost two full years, our armed forces have been fighting in Korea, suffering casualties of over 108,000 men. Hostilities have not abated. The “determination of the United Nations to continue its action in Korea to meet the aggression” has been reaffirmed. Congressional support of the action in Korea has been manifested by provisions for increased military manpower and equipment and for economic stabilization, as hereinafter described. Alert to our responsibilities, which coincide with our own self preservation through mutual security, Congress has enacted a large body of implementing legislation. As an illustration of the magnitude of the over-all program, Congress has appropriated $130 billion for our own defense and for military assistance to our allies since the June, 1950, attack in Korea.</p>
<p id="fba2bb25-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President has the duty to execute the foregoing legislative programs. Their successful execution depends upon continued production of steel and stabilized prices for steel. Accordingly, when the collective bargaining agreements between the Nation’s steel producers and their employees, represented by the United Steel Workers, were due to expire on December 31, 1951, and a strike shutting down the entire basic steel industry was threatened, the President acted to avert a complete shutdown of steel production.</p>
<p id="fba2bb26-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One is not here called upon even to consider the possibility of executive seizure of a farm, a corner grocery store or even a single industrial plant. Such considerations arise only when one ignores the central fact of this case — that the Nation’s entire basic steel production would have shut down completely if there had been no Government seizure. Even ignoring for the moment whatever confidential information the President may possess as “the Nation’s organ for foreign affairs,” the uncontroverted affidavits in this record amply support the finding that “a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense.”</p>
<p id="fba2bb27-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs do not remotely suggest any basis for rejecting the President’s finding that any stoppage of steel production would immediately place the Nation in peril. At the time of seizure there was not, and there is not now, the slightest evidence to justify the belief that any strike will be of short duration. The Union <span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>and the steel companies may well engage in a lengthy struggle. Plaintiff’s counsel tells us that “sooner or later” the mills will operate again. That may satisfy the steel companies and, perhaps, the Union. But our soldiers and our allies will hardly be cheered with the assurance that the ammunition upon which their lives depend will be forthcoming — “sooner or later,” or, in other words, “too little and too late.”</p>
<p id="fba2bb28-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, if the President has any power under the Constitution to meet a critical situation in the absence of express statutory authorization, there is no basis whatever for criticizing the exercise of such power in this case.</p>
<p id="fba2bb29-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A review of executive action demonstrates that our Presidents have on many occasions exhibited the leadership contemplated by the framers when they made the President Commander in Chief, and imposed upon him the trust to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” With or without explicit statutory authorization, Presidents have at such times dealt with national emergencies by acting promptly and resolutely to enforce legislative programs, at least to save those programs until Congress could act. Congress and the courts have responded to such executive initiative with consistent approval.</p>
<p id="fba2bb2a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing now on the situation confronting the President on the night of April 8, 1952, we cannot but conclude that the President was performing his duty under the Constitution to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” — a duty described by President Benjamin Harrison as “the central idea of the office.” The President reported to Congress the morning after the seizure that he acted because a work stoppage in steel production would immediately imperil the safety of the Nation by preventing execution of the legislative programs for procurement of military equipment. And, while a shutdown could be averted by granting the price concessions requested by plaintiffs, granting such concessions would disrupt the price stabilization program also enacted by Congress. Rather than fail to execute either legislative program, the President acted to execute both.</p>
<p id="fba2e23b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the argument in this case has been directed at straw men. We do not now have before us the case of a President acting solely on the basis of his own notions of the public welfare. Nor is there any question of unlimited executive power in this case. The President himself closed the door to any such claim when he sent his Message to Congress stating his purpose to abide by any action of Congress, whether approving or disapproving his seizure action. Here, the President immediately made sure that Congress was fully informed of the temporary action he had taken only to preserve the legislative programs from destruction until Congress could act.</p>
<p id="fba2e23c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Faced with the duty of executing the defense programs which Congress had enacted and the disastrous effects that any stoppage in steel production would have on those programs, the President acted to preserve those programs by seizing the steel mills. There is no question that the possession was other than temporary in character and subject to congressional direction — either approving, disapproving or regulating the manner in which the mills were to be administered and returned to the owners. The President immediately informed Congress of his action and clearly stated his intention to abide by the legislative will. No basis for claims of arbitrary action, unlimited powers or dictatorial usurpation of congressional power appears from the facts of this case. On the contrary, judicial, legislative and executive precedents throughout our history demonstrate that in this case the President acted in full conformity with his duties under the Constitution.</p><span title="285" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-285">p. 285</span>

<p id="fba2e23f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue of when the president may exercise inherent power arises in many contexts and is discussed throughout this chapter.</p>
<p id="fba2e240-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most important issues concerning the inherent power of the president is whether and under what circumstances the president can invoke executive privilege. Executive privilege refers to the ability of the president to keep secret conversations with or memoranda to or from advisors. The Constitution does not mention such authority, but presidents have claimed it throughout American history. Presidents have contended that executive privilege is necessary for them to receive candid advice. Also, executive privilege is defended as important to protect national security; diplomacy is regarded as requiring secrecy.</p>
<p id="fba2e241-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court did not expressly consider the constitutionality and scope of executive privilege until 1974 in the landmark case of United States v. Nixon. Some factual background will help in understanding the case that follows. On June 17, 1972, a burglary occurred at the Democratic National Headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. Over the course of the next year, it was discovered that the burglars were connected to the Committee for the Reelection of the President and that high-level White House officials were involved in a cover-up. The year was filled with reporters finding evidence linking the burglary and cover-up to high officials, the president and his aides angrily denying the evidence and attacking the media, and then reporters finding further evidence and making additional allegations against the White House.</p>
<p id="fba2e242-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the summer of 1973, Senator Sam Ervin from North Carolina chaired closely watched hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Watergate. One of the dramatic moments occurred when a presidential aide, Alexander Butterfield, revealed that there was a secret taping system in the Oval Office and that presidential conversations were routinely recorded.</p>
<p id="fba2e243-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because top Justice Department officials, including former Attorney General John Mitchell, were suspected of involvement in the cover-up, there was political pressure for an independent investigation. Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed Harvard law professor Archibald Cox to serve as a special prosecutor.</p>
<p id="fba2e244-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cox subpoenaed tapes of White House conversations, and the president challenged the subpoena in courts. On October 12, 1973, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the special prosecutor and gave the president one week to file an appeal. On October 19, the president announced that he would turn over edited transcripts of the tapes and that he would ask Senator John Stennis (who was reported to be quite hard of hearing) to listen to the tapes and verify their accuracy. President Nixon also announced that he would comply with no additional subpoenas and turn over no additional tapes.</p>
<p id="fba2e245-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Saturday, October 20, Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox declared Nixon’s position unacceptable; there was a court order to turn over tapes, not transcripts. More important, he would seek whatever tapes he needed. President Nixon ordered Attorney General Richardson to fire Cox; Richardson refused and resigned. Nixon then asked the Justice Department’s number-two official to fire Cox; William Ruckelshaus also refused and resigned. The request was then made to the number-three person in the Justice Department, Solicitor General <span title="286" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-286">p. 286</span>Robert Bork. Bork then fired Cox in what came to be known as the Saturday Night Massacre.</p>
<p id="fba2e246-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first resolutions calling for Richard Nixon’s impeachment were introduced into the House of Representatives and intense political pressure caused the appointment of a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski. On March 1, 1974, a grand jury for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted seven top officials of the Nixon administration and the Committee for the Reelection of the President for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud. President Nixon was named an “unindicted co-conspirator.” The grand jury said that it would have indicted him for being part of the conspiracy, but did not know if it had the authority to indict a sitting president.</p>
<p id="fba2e247-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 18, 1974, a subpoena duces tecum (a subpoena to produce documents) was issued, at the request of the special prosecutor, for the president to turn over tapes and other materials to use as possible evidence in the upcoming criminal trial. On April 30, President Nixon announced that he was disclosing edited transcripts of 43 conversations, including 20 that were the subject of the subpoena. On May 1, the president moved to quash the subpoena. On May 20, the U.S. District Court denied the motion to quash and directed the president to provide all of the items that had been subpoenaed. The Supreme Court granted review prior to consideration by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="fba2e248-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee was considering articles of impeachment against President Nixon. Impeachment hearings were held in July 1974, while the <i>Nixon</i> case was pending before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court announced its decision in <i>Nixon</i> on July 25, 1974, and unanimously ruled that Nixon had to comply with the subpoena. The House Judiciary Committee voted its first article of impeachment on July 25 for obstruction of justice in connection with the Watergate break-in and cover-up. On July 29 and 30, the Committee voted two additional articles of impeachment for abuse of power and for failure to comply with a judiciary committee subpoena.</p>
<p id="fba2e249-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 6, 1974, President Nixon complied with the subpoena and made the transcripts of the tapes available to the public. The tapes showed that President Nixon clearly had obstructed justice by ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation not to investigate the Watergate matter. Three days later, on Thursday, August 9, 1974, President Nixon became the only president in history to resign.</p>

<p id="fba30962-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e turn to the claim that the subpoena should be quashed because it demands “confidential conversations between a President and his close advisors that it <span title="287" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-287">p. 287</span>would be inconsistent with the public interest to produce.” The first contention is a broad claim that the separation of powers doctrine precludes judicial review of a President’s claim of privilege. The second contention is that if he does not prevail on the claim of absolute privilege, the court should hold as a matter of constitutional law that the privilege <span class="epub-small-caps">prevails</span> over the subpoena duces tecum.</p>
<p id="fba30963-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others. The President’s counsel, as we have noted, reads the Constitution as providing an absolute privilege of confidentiality for all Presidential communications. Many decisions of this Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury v. Madison (1803), that “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</p>
<p id="fba30964-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our system of government “requires that federal courts on occasion interpret the Constitution in a manner at variance with the construction given the document by another branch.” Powell v. McCormack. Notwithstanding the deference each branch must accord the others, the “judicial Power of the United States” vested in the federal courts by Art. III, §1, of the Constitution can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a Presidential veto. Any other conclusion would be contrary to the basic concept of separation of powers and the checks and balances that flow from the scheme of a tripartite government. We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and duty of this Court “to say what the law is” with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case. Marbury v. Madison.</p>

<p id="fba30966-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In support of his claim of absolute privilege, the President’s counsel urges two grounds, one of which is common to all governments and one of which is peculiar to our system of separation of powers. The first ground is the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion. Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process. Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.</p>
<p id="fba32f77-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second ground asserted by the President’s counsel in support of the claim of absolute privilege rests on the doctrine of separation of powers. Here it is argued that the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere, insulates a President from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution, and thereby protects confidential Presidential communications.</p>
<p id="fba32f78-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, neither the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, <span title="288" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-288">p. 288</span>unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances. The President’s need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts. However, when the privilege depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations, a confrontation with other values arises. Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of Presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of such material for in camera inspection with all the protection that a district court will be obliged to provide.</p>
<p id="fba32f79-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impediment that an absolute, unqualified privilege would place in the way of the primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under Art. III. In designing the structure of our Government and dividing and allocating the sovereign power among three co-equal branches, the framers of the Constitution sought to provide a comprehensive system, but the separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence.</p>
<p id="fba32f7a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To read the Art. II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and non-diplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of “a workable government” and gravely impair the role of the courts under Art. III.</p>

<p id="fba32f7c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since we conclude that the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential privilege, it is necessary to resolve those competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch.</p>
<p id="fba32f7d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the President challenges a subpoena served on him as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a criminal prosecution; he does so on the claim that he has a privilege against disclosure of confidential communications. He does not place his claim of privilege on the ground they are military or diplomatic secrets. As to these areas of Art. II duties the courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities.</p>
<p id="fba32f7e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No case of the Court, however, has extended this high degree of deference to a President’s generalized interest in confidentiality. Nowhere in the Constitution, as we have noted earlier, is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality, yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers, it is constitutionally based.</p>
<p id="fba32f7f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to the production of all evidence at a criminal trial similarly has constitutional dimensions. The Sixth Amendment explicitly confers upon every defendant in a criminal trial the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him” and “to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.” Moreover, the Fifth Amendment also guarantees that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law. It is the manifest duty of the courts to vindicate those guarantees, and to accomplish that it is essential that all relevant and admissible evidence be produced.</p>
<p id="fba32f80-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case we must weigh the importance of the general privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in performance of the President’s responsibilities against the inroads of such a privilege on the fair administration of criminal justice. The interest in preserving confidentiality is weighty indeed <span title="289" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-289">p. 289</span>and entitled to great respect. However, we cannot conclude that advisers will be moved to temper the candor of their remarks by the infrequent occasions of disclosure because of the possibility that such conversations will be called for in the context of a criminal prosecution.</p>
<p id="fba32f81-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the courts. A President’s acknowledged need for confidentiality in the communications of his office is general in nature, whereas the constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and central to the fair adjudication of a particular criminal case in the administration of justice. Without access to specific facts a criminal prosecution may be totally frustrated. The President’s broad interest in confidentiality of communications will not be vitiated by disclosure of a limited number of conversations preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending criminal cases.</p>
<p id="fba32f82-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.</p>

<p id="fba32f83-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the first time since United States v. Nixon, in Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367 (2004), the Supreme Court considered an issue of executive privilege. The case arose in an unusual procedural context. A lawsuit was filed claiming that an energy task force, chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney, violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act by holding secret meetings. The plaintiffs sought and received a discovery order. The defendants then sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals to stop enforcement of the discovery order. The Court of Appeals denied the writ of mandamus. In the context of considering whether the Court of Appeals should have issued a writ of mandamus, the Supreme Court discussed executive privilege and when it is to be considered. The Court did not resolve whether executive privilege applied here, or even whether mandamus should be issued. The Court remanded the case for further consideration. In discussing executive privilege, the Court, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy, distinguished United States v. Nixon, and stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba32f84-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]eparation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals’ evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President. The Court of Appeals dismissed these separation-of-powers concerns. Relying on United States v. Nixon, it held that even though respondents’ discovery requests are overbroad and “go well beyond FACA’s requirements,” the Vice President and his former colleagues on the NEPDG “shall bear the burden” of invoking privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with “detailed precision.”</p>

<p id="fba35695-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This analysis, however, overlooks fundamental differences in the two cases. <i>Nixon</i> cannot bear the weight the Court of Appeals puts upon it. First, unlike this case, which concerns respondents’ requests for information for use in a civil suit, <i>Nixon</i> involves the proper balance between the Executive’s interest in the <span title="290" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-290">p. 290</span>confidentiality of its communications and the “constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding.” The distinction <i>Nixon</i> drew between criminal and civil proceedings is not just a matter of formalism. As the Court explained, the need for information in the criminal context is much weightier because “our historic[al] commitment to the rule of law . . . is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that ‘the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.’” The need for information for use in civil cases, while far from negligible, does not share the urgency or significance of the criminal subpoena requests in <i>Nixon.</i> As <i>Nixon</i> recognized, the right to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have the same “constitutional dimensions.”</p>
<p id="fba35696-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the District Court’s and the Court of Appeals’ conclusions, <i>Nixon</i> does not leave them the sole option of inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege while remaining otherwise powerless to modify a party’s overly broad discovery requests. Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power “not to be lightly invoked.” Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced into the difficult task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and the Executive’s Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive’s claims of confidentiality and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers and checks and balances. These “occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two branches” should be avoided whenever possible.</p>
<p id="fba35697-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we discussed at the outset, under principles of mandamus jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may exercise its power to issue the writ only upon a finding of “exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial ‘usurpation of power,’” or “a clear abuse of discretion.” As this case implicates the separation of powers, the Court of Appeals must also ask, as part of this inquiry, whether the District Court’s actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.</p>
<p id="fba35698-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We decline petitioners’ invitation to direct the Court of Appeals to issue the writ against the District Court. [M]atters bearing on whether the writ of mandamus should issue should also be addressed, in the first instance, by the Court of Appeals after considering any additional briefs and arguments as it deems appropriate. We note only that all courts should be mindful of the burdens imposed on the Executive Branch in any future proceedings. Special considerations applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests by the Government for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, for example, whether the statute embodies the de facto membership doctrine.</p>

<div id="fba35699-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fba3569a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a"><i>THE AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS TO INCREASE EXECUTIVE POWER</i></p></h3></div>


<p id="fba3569b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The above discussion focused on the power of the president to act without express constitutional or statutory authority. But what about the power of Congress to enhance the powers of the president by conferring authority not contained in the Constitution? Underlying this issue are two different views of separation of powers. One approach sees separation of powers as appropriately resolved, whenever possible, between the president and Congress; if the two branches agree, the courts only rarely should invalidate their actions. The other view sees separation of powers as limits mandated by the Constitution and therefore envisions a crucial judicial role in enforcing its requirements.</p>
<p id="fba3569c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="291" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-291">p. 291</span>The issue of Congress’s authority to increase executive power arises again, importantly, in the next section, which focuses on the ability of Congress to delegate legislative power to administrative agencies. In Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a federal statute that created authority for a presidential line-item veto. The statute empowered the president to veto (or more precisely to “cancel”) particular parts of appropriation bills while allowing the rest to go into effect.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10290_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10290_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">4</a></span> Congress could overturn such a veto by a majority vote of both houses.</p>
<p id="fba3569e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, declared this statutory increase in presidential power unconstitutional. Justice Stevens explained that the president, by exercising the line-item veto, was changing a law adopted by Congress; the final version of the law is different after the veto than what Congress passed. The Court concluded that the Constitution does not allow such presidential authority. Justice Stevens wrote: “In both legal and practical effect, the President has amended two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each. ‘[R]epeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art. I.’ There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” The Court emphasized that the procedures for enacting and vetoing laws contained in the Constitution must be strictly adhered to and that any changes must come from a constitutional amendment, not legislative action.</p>
<p id="fba3569f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer, joined by Justices O’Connor and Scalia, dissented, and stressed the practical need for a line-item veto. He explained that when the Constitution was written, the national budget was $4 million and each appropriation could be in a separate bill. Today, though, with a federal budget of $1.5 trillion, “a typical budget appropriations bill may have a dozen titles, hundreds of sections, and spread across more than 500 pages of the Statutes at Large. Congress cannot divide such a bill into thousands, or tens of thousands, of separate appropriations bills, each one of which the President would have to sign, or to veto, separately.”</p>
<p id="fba356a0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the president was amending the law by exercising the line-item veto. Justice Breyer explained: “When the President ‘canceled’ the two appropriation measures now before us, he did not repeal any law nor did he amend any law. He simply followed the law, leaving the statutes, as they are literally written, intact.”</p>
<p id="fba356a1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In large part, the difference between the majority in Clinton v. City of New York is the difference between a formalist and a functional approach to separation of powers that reappears throughout the material in this chapter. Justice Stevens’s majority opinion was highly formalistic in stressing the procedures prescribed in the Constitution for enacting laws and eschewing any consideration of the practical benefits of a line-item veto. In contrast, Justice Breyer’s dissenting opinion emphasized the need for a line-item veto in light of the myriad ways in which the budget process has changed with the growth of government over 200 years.</p>

<p id="fba37db4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most dramatic changes in American government since the Constitution was written in 1787 has been the growth of administrative agencies. Although federal agencies and departments have existed in some form since the beginning of American history, it is only in the last century that Congress has routinely delegated its legislative power to executive agencies. The creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887 ushered in a new era for the federal government: the creation of federal administrative agencies with broad powers. Over the course of the next century, a vast array of federal agencies were created, such as the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and countless more.</p>
<p id="fba37db5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These agencies exercise all of the powers of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. Administrative agencies generally have legislative power, as they possess the authority to promulgate rules that have the force of law. Administrative agencies also have executive power, because they are responsible for bringing enforcement actions against those who violate the relevant federal laws and regulations. Finally, administrative agencies frequently have judicial power in that they employ administrative law judges who hear cases brought by agency officials against those accused of violating the agency’s regulations.</p>
<p id="fba37db6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The combination of legislative, executive, and judicial power in the same hands is troubling. James Madison wrote, “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” The Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). More generally, controlling and checking administrative agencies poses an important constitutional problem, unaddressed by the text or the framers’ intent.</p>
<p id="fba37db7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection 1 considers the nondelegation doctrine, the principle that Congress cannot delegate legislative power, and its demise. The existence of broad delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies is part of the constitutional problem posed by administrative agencies. One possible check on administrative agencies is the “legislative veto”: Congress, acting pursuant to statutory authorization, invalidates an agency’s action by a resolution that is not presented to the President for a possible veto. However, as presented in Subsection 2, the Supreme Court declared this tool unconstitutional. Subsection 3 then examines other checks on administrative agencies, including the appointment and removal power, judicial review, and Congress delegating authority to itself.</p>
<p id="fba37db8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tension explored throughout this section is on how to reconcile the practical need for administrative agencies in the complex, modern world with basic principles of separation of powers and checks and balances.</p>

<p id="fba37dbb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One solution to the constitutional problems posed by administrative agencies is the non-delegation doctrine: the principle that Congress may not delegate its legislative power to administrative agencies.

<p id="fba37dbc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The height of the Court’s enforcement of the nondelegation doctrine was in the mid-1930s in two decisions that invalidated New Deal legislation.

<p id="fba3a4d5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question, then, turns upon the authority which section 3 of the Recovery Act vests in the President to approve or prescribe. If the codes have standing as penal statutes, this must be due to the effect of the executive action. But Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President to exercise an unfettered discretion to make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable for the rehabilitation and expansion of trade or industry.</p>
<p id="fba3a4d6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly we turn to the Recovery Act to ascertain what limits have been set to the exercise of the President’s discretion: First, the President, as a condition of approval, is required to find that the trade or industrial associations or groups which propose a code “impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership” and are “truly representative.” That condition, however, relates only to the status of the initiators of the new laws and not to the permissible scope of such laws. Second, the President is required to find that the code is not “designed to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discriminate against them.” And to this is added a proviso that the code “shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices.” But these restrictions leave virtually untouched the field of policy envisaged by section 1, and, in that wide field of legislative possibilities, the proponents of a code, refraining from monopolistic designs, may roam at will, and the President may approve or disapprove their proposals as he may see fit. That is the precise effect of the further finding that the President is to make — that the code “will tend to effectuate the policy of this title.”</p>
<p id="fba3a4d7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3 of the Recovery Act is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe rules of <span title="294" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-294">p. 294</span>conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>

<p id="fba3a4df-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 11, 1933, the President, by Executive Order No. 6199 prohibited “the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum and the products thereof produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted to be produced or withdrawn from storage by any State law or valid regulation or order prescribed thereunder, by any board, commission, officer, or other duly authorized agency of a State.” This action was based on section 9(c) of title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933.</p>
<p id="fba3a4e0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The federal law] contains nothing as to the circumstances or conditions in which transportation of petroleum or petroleum products should be -prohibited — nothing as to the policy of prohibiting or not prohibiting the transportation of production exceeding what the states allow.</p>
<p id="fba3a4e1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no answer to insist that deleterious consequences follow the transportation of “hot oil” — oil exceeding state allowances. The Congress did not prohibit that transportation. The Congress did not undertake to say that transportation of “hot oil” was injurious. The Congress did not say that transportation of that oil was “unfair competition.” The Congress did not declare in what circumstances that transportation should be forbidden, or require the President to make any determination as to any facts or circumstances. Among the numerous and diverse objectives broadly stated, the President was not required to choose. The President was not required to ascertain and proclaim the conditions prevailing in the industry which made the prohibition necessary. The Congress left the matter to the President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.</p>
<p id="fba3cbf2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution provides that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” And the Congress is empowered “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” its general powers. The Congress manifestly is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested. Undoubtedly legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the national Legislature cannot deal directly. The Constitution has <span title="295" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-295">p. 295</span>never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function in laying down policies and establishing standards, while leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. Without capacity to give authorizations of that sort we should have the anomaly of a legislative power which in many circumstances calling for its exertion would be but a futility. But the constant recognition of the necessity and validity of such provisions and the wide range of administrative authority which has been developed by means of them cannot be allowed to obscure the limitations of the authority to delegate, if our constitutional system is to be maintained.</p>
<p id="fba3cbf3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If section 9(c) were held valid, it would be idle to pretend that anything would be left of limitations upon the power of the Congress to delegate its lawmaking function. The reasoning of the many decisions we have reviewed would be made vacuous and their distinctions nugatory. Instead of performing its lawmaking function, the Congress could at will and as to such subjects as it chooses transfer that function to the President or other officer or to an administrative body. The question is not of the intrinsic importance of the particular statute before us, but of the constitutional processes of legislation which are an essential part of our system of government.</p>

<p id="fba3cbf4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the more than 90 years since <i>Panama Oil</i> and <i>Schechter</i>, not a single federal law has been declared an impermissible delegation of legislative power by the Supreme Court. Although these decisions have not been expressly overruled, they never have been followed either. All delegations, no matter how broad, have been upheld. Although the Court says that when Congress delegates its legislative power it must provide criteria to guide the agency’s exercise of discretion,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10360_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10360_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">6</a></span> all delegations, even without any criteria, have been upheld. Undoubtedly, this reflects a judicial judgment that broad delegations were necessary in the complex world of the late twentieth century and that the judiciary is ill equipped to draw meaningful lines. For example, in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Sentencing Reform Act, which created the United States Sentencing Commission, an agency located in the judicial branch with broad discretion to promulgate sentencing guidelines to determine the punishments for those convicted of federal crimes.</p>
<p id="fba3cbf6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many have predicted a revival of the nondelegation doctrine, but it has not happened, as illustrated by the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Gundy v. United States<i>.</i> In <i>Gundy</i>, the Court again rejected a challenge to a federal law on this basis. But notice that the decision was 5-3 (Justice Kavanaugh had not been confirmed when the case was argued) and it is without a majority opinion. Although Justice Kagan’s plurality opinion would give little effect to the non-delegation doctrine, Justice Alito’s brief concurring opinion expresses a willingness to reconsider the law in this area. In light of the dissent and the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, there might be a majority willing to do so.</p>

<p id="fba3cbff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes and crimes against children through sex-offender registration schemes. In 1994, Congress first conditioned certain federal funds on States’ adoption of registration laws meeting prescribed minimum standards. Two years later, Congress strengthened those standards, most notably by insisting that States inform local communities of registrants’ addresses. By that time, every State and the District of Columbia had enacted a sex-offender registration law. But the state statutes varied along many dimensions, and Congress came to realize that their “loopholes and deficiencies” had allowed over 100,000 sex offenders (about 20% of the total) to escape registration. In 2006, to address those failings, Congress enacted SORNA.</p>
<p id="fba3cc00-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">SORNA makes “more uniform and effective” the prior “patchwork” of sex-offender registration systems. The Act’s express “purpose” is “to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children” by “establish[ing] a comprehensive national system for [their] registration.” To that end, SORNA covers more sex offenders, and imposes more onerous registration requirements, than most States had before. The Act also backs up those requirements with new criminal penalties. Any person required to register under SORNA who knowingly fails to do so (and who travels in interstate commerce) may be imprisoned for up to ten years.</p>
<p id="fba3cc01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 20913 — the disputed provision here — elaborates the “[i]nitial registration” requirements for sex offenders. Subsection (b) sets out the general rule: An offender must register “before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement” (or, if the offender is not sentenced to prison, “not later than [three] business days after being sentenced”). Two provisions down, subsection (d) addresses (in its title’s words) the “[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).” The provision states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba3cc02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter . . . and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).”</p>
</div>
<p id="fba3f313-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>Subsection (d), in other words, focuses on individuals convicted of a sex offense before SORNA’s enactment — a group we will call pre-Act offenders. Many of these individuals were unregistered at the time of SORNA’s enactment, either because pre-existing law did not cover them or because they had successfully evaded that law (so were “lost” to the system). And of those potential new registrants, many or most could not comply with subsection (b)’s registration rule because they had already completed their prison sentences. For the entire group of pre-Act offenders, once again, the Attorney General “shall have the authority” to “specify the applicability” of SORNA’s registration requirements and “to prescribe rules for [their] registration.”</p>
<p id="fba3f314-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued an interim rule in February 2007, specifying that SORNA’s registration requirements apply in full to “sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of that Act.” The final rule, issued in December 2010, reiterated that SORNA applies to all pre-Act offenders. That rule has remained the same to this day.</p>
<p id="fba3f315-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Herman Gundy is a pre-Act offender. The year before SORNA’s enactment, he pleaded guilty under Maryland law for sexually assaulting a minor. After his release from prison in 2012, Gundy came to live in New York. But he never registered there as a sex offender. A few years later, he was convicted for failing to register, in violation of §2250. He argued below (among other things) that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to “specify the applicability” of SORNA’s registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected that claim, as had every other court (including eleven Courts of Appeals) to consider the issue. Today, we join the consensus and affirm.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fba3f316-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">II</p></div>
<p id="fba3f317-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article I of the Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” Accompanying that assignment of power to Congress is a bar on its further delegation. Congress, this Court explained early on, may not transfer to another branch “powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.” But the Constitution does not “deny[ ] to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality [that enable it] to perform its function[s].” Congress may “obtain[ ] the assistance of its coordinate Branches” — and in particular, may confer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and enforce the laws. “[I]n our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems,” this Court has understood that “Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.” So we have held, time and again, that a statutory delegation is constitutional as long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.”</p>
<p id="fba3f318-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that standard, a nondelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation. The constitutional question is whether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion. So the answer requires construing the challenged statute to figure <span title="298" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-298">p. 298</span>out what task it delegates and what instructions it provides. Only after a court has determined a challenged statute’s meaning can it decide whether the law sufficiently guides executive discretion to accord with Article I. And indeed, once a court interprets the statute, it may find that the constitutional question all but answers itself.</p>
<p id="fba3f319-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is the case here, because §20913(d) does not give the Attorney General anything like the “unguided” and “unchecked” authority that Gundy says. The provision, in Gundy’s view, “grants the Attorney General plenary power to determine SORNA’s applicability to pre-Act offenders — to require them to register, or not, as she sees fit, and to change her policy for any reason and at any time.” If that were so, we would face a nondelegation question. But it is not. This Court has already interpreted §20913(d) to say something different — to require the Attorney General to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible. And revisiting that issue yet more fully today, we reach the same conclusion. The text, considered alongside its context, purpose, and history, makes clear that the Attorney General’s discretion extends only to considering and addressing feasibility issues. Given that statutory meaning, Gundy’s constitutional claim must fail. Section 20913(d)’s delegation falls well within permissible bounds.</p>
<p id="fba3f31a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall again the delegation provision at issue. Congress gave the Attorney General authority to “specify the applicability” of SORNA’s requirements to pre-Act offenders. §20913(d). And in the second half of the same sentence, Congress gave him authority to “prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders . . . who are unable to comply with” subsection (b)’s initial registration requirement. What does the delegation in §20913(d) allow the Attorney General to do?</p>
<p id="fba3f31b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The different answers on offer here reflect competing views of statutory interpretation. As noted above, Gundy urges us to read §20913(d) to empower the Attorney General to do whatever he wants as to pre-Act offenders: He may make them all register immediately or he may exempt them from registration forever (or he may do anything in between). Gundy bases that argument on the first half of §20913(d), isolated from everything else — from the second half of the same section, from surrounding provisions in SORNA, and from any conception of the statute’s history and purpose. Reynolds [v. United States (2012)] took a different approach (as does the Government here), understanding statutory interpretation as a “holistic endeavor” which determines meaning by looking not to isolated words, but to text in context, along with purpose and history.</p>
<p id="fba3f31c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has long refused to construe words “in a vacuum,” as Gundy attempts. “It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” And beyond context and structure, the Court often looks to “history [and] purpose” to divine the meaning of language. That non-blinkered brand of interpretation holds good for delegations, just as for other statutory provisions. To define the scope of delegated authority, we have looked to the text in “context” and in light of the statutory “purpose.” In keeping with that method, we again do so today.</p>
<p id="fba3f31d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So begin at the beginning, with the “[d]eclaration of purpose” that is SORNA’s first sentence. There, Congress announced that “to protect the public,” it was “establish[ing] a comprehensive national system for the registration” of “sex offenders and offenders against children.” The term “comprehensive” has a clear meaning — something that is all-encompassing or sweeping. That <span title="299" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-299">p. 299</span>description could not fit the system SORNA created if the Attorney General could decline, for any reason or no reason at all, to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders. After all, for many years after SORNA’s enactment, the great majority of sex offenders in the country would be pre-Act offenders. If Gundy were right, all of those offenders could be exempt from SORNA’s registration requirements. So the mismatch between SORNA’s statement of purpose and Gundy’s view of §20913(d) is as stark as stark comes.</p>
<p id="fba3f31e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act’s legislative history backs up everything said above by showing that the need to register pre-Act offenders was front and center in Congress’s thinking. Recall that Congress designed SORNA to address “loopholes and deficiencies” in existing registration laws.</p>
<p id="fba3f31f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now that we have determined what §20913(d) means, we can consider whether it violates the Constitution. The question becomes: Did Congress make an impermissible delegation when it instructed the Attorney General to apply SORNA’s registration requirements to pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible? Under this Court’s long-established law, that question is easy. Its answer is no.</p>
<p id="fba3f320-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted earlier, this Court has held that a delegation is constitutional so long as Congress has set out an “intelligible principle” to guide the delegee’s exercise of authority. Or in a related formulation, the Court has stated that a delegation is permissible if Congress has made clear to the delegee “the general policy” he must pursue and the “boundaries of [his] authority.” Those standards, the Court has made clear, are not demanding. “[W]e have ‘almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.’” Only twice in this country’s history (and that in a single year) have we found a delegation excessive — in each case because “Congress had failed to articulate <i>any</i> policy or standard” to confine discretion. See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan (1935). By contrast, we have over and over upheld even very broad delegations. Here is a sample: We have approved delegations to various agencies to regulate in the “public interest.” We have sustained authorizations for agencies to set “fair and equitable” prices and “just and reasonable” rates. We more recently affirmed a delegation to an agency to issue whatever air quality standards are “requisite to protect the public health.”</p>
<p id="fba3f321-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that context, the delegation in SORNA easily passes muster (as all eleven circuit courts to have considered the question found). The statute conveyed Congress’s policy that the Attorney General require pre-Act offenders to register as soon as feasible. Under the law, the feasibility issues he could address were administrative — and, more specifically, transitional — in nature.</p>
<p id="fba3f322-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, if SORNA’s delegation is unconstitutional, then most of Government is unconstitutional — dependent as Congress is on the need to give discretion to executive officials to implement its programs. Consider again this Court’s long-time recognition: “Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.” Among the judgments often left to executive officials are ones involving feasibility.</p>

Yet the statute before us scrambles that design. It purports to endow the nation’s chief prosecutor with the power to write his own criminal code governing the lives of a half-million citizens.

Working from an understanding of the Constitution at war with its text and history, the plurality reimagines the terms of the statute before us and insists there is nothing wrong with Congress handing off so much power to the Attorney General. But Justice Alito supplies the fifth vote for today’s judgment and he does not join either the plurality’s constitutional or statutory analysis, indicating instead that he remains willing, in a future case with a full Court, to revisit these matters. Respectfully, I would not wait.</p>

<p id="fba41a3c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For individuals convicted of sex offenses <i>after</i> Congress adopted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) in 2006, the statute offers detailed instructions.</p>
<p id="fba41a3d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But what about those convicted of sex offenses <i>before</i> the Act’s adoption? At the time of SORNA’s enactment, the nation’s population of sex offenders exceeded 500,000, and Congress concluded that something had to be done about these “pre-Act” offenders too. But it seems Congress couldn’t agree what that should be. The treatment of pre-Act offenders proved a “controversial issue with major policy significance and practical ramifications for states.” Among other things, applying SORNA immediately to this group threatened to impose unpopular and costly burdens on States and localities by forcing them to adopt or overhaul their own sex offender registration schemes. So Congress simply passed the problem to the Attorney General. For all half-million pre-Act offenders, the law says only this, in 34 U.S.C. §20913(d):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba41a3e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment <span title="301" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-301">p. 301</span>of this chapter . . . and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offender.”</p>
</div>
<p id="fba41a3f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yes, that’s it. The breadth of the authority Congress granted to the Attorney General in these few words can only be described as vast. As the Department of Justice itself has acknowledged, SORNA “does not require the Attorney General” to impose registration requirements on pre-Act offenders “within a certain time frame or by a date certain; it does not require him to act at all.” If the Attorney General does choose to act, he can require all pre-Act offenders to register, or he can “require some but not all to register.” For those he requires to register, the Attorney General may impose “some but not all of [SORNA’s] registration requirements,” as he pleases. And he is free to change his mind on any of these matters “at any given time or over the course of different [political] administrations.” Congress thus gave the Attorney General free rein to write the rules for virtually the entire existing sex offender population in this country — a situation that promised to persist for years or decades until pre-Act offenders passed away or fulfilled the terms of their registration obligations and post-Act offenders came to predominate.</p>
<p id="fba44150-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unsurprisingly, different Attorneys General have exercised their discretion in different ways. For six months after SORNA’s enactment, Attorney General Gonzales left past offenders alone. Then the pendulum swung the other direction when the Department of Justice issued an interim rule requiring pre-Act offenders to follow all the same rules as post-Act offenders. A year later, Attorney General Mukasey issued more new guidelines, this time directing the States to register some but not all past offenders. Three years after that, Attorney General Holder required the States to register only those pre-Act offenders convicted of a new felony after SORNA’s enactment. Various Attorneys General have also taken different positions on whether pre-Act offenders might be entitled to credit for time spent in the community before SORNA was enacted.</p>
<p id="fba44151-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These unbounded policy choices have profound consequences for the people they affect. Take our case. Before SORNA’s enactment, Herman Gundy pleaded guilty in 2005 to a sexual offense. After his release from prison five years later, he was arrested again, this time for failing to register as a sex offender according to the rules the Attorney General had then prescribed for pre-Act offenders. As a result, Mr. Gundy faced an additional 10-year prison term — 10 years more than if the Attorney General had, in his discretion, chosen to write the rules differently.</p>

<p id="fba44153-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The framers understood, too, that it would frustrate “the system of government ordained by the Constitution” if Congress could merely announce vague aspirations and then assign others the responsibility of adopting legislation to realize its goals. Through the Constitution, after all, the people had vested the power to prescribe rules limiting their liberties in Congress alone. No one, not even Congress, had the right to alter that arrangement. As Chief Justice Marshall explained, Congress may not “delegate . . . powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.”</p>
<p id="fba44154-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why did the framers insist on this particular arrangement? They believed the new federal government’s most dangerous power was the power to enact laws <span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>restricting the people’s liberty. An “excess of law-making” was, in their words, one of “the diseases to which our governments are most liable.” To address that tendency, the framers went to great lengths to make lawmaking difficult. Nor was the point only to limit the government’s capacity to restrict the people’s freedoms. Article I’s detailed processes for new laws were also designed to promote deliberation.</p>
<p id="fba44155-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other purposes animated the framers’ design as well. Because men are not angels and majorities can threaten minority rights, the framers insisted on a legislature composed of different bodies subject to different electorates as a means of ensuring that any new law would have to secure the approval of a supermajority of the people’s representatives. This, in turn, assured minorities that their votes would often decide the fate of proposed legislation.</p>
<p id="fba44156-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Congress could pass off its legislative power to the executive branch, the “[v]esting [c]lauses, and indeed the entire structure of the Constitution,” would “make no sense.” Without the involvement of representatives from across the country or the demands of bicameralism and presentment, legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President. And if laws could be simply declared by a single person, they would not be few in number, the product of widespread social consensus, likely to protect minority interests, or apt to provide stability and fair notice. Accountability would suffer too. Legislators might seek to take credit for addressing a pressing social problem by sending it to the executive for resolution, while at the same time blaming the executive for the problems that attend whatever measures he chooses to pursue. In turn, the executive might point to Congress as the source of the problem. These opportunities for finger-pointing might prove temptingly advantageous for the politicians involved, but they would also threaten to “‘disguise . . . responsibility for . . . the decisions.’”</p>
<p id="fba44157-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accepting, then, that we have an obligation to decide whether Congress has unconstitutionally divested itself of its legislative responsibilities, the question follows: What’s the test?</p>
<p id="fba44158-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we know that as long as Congress makes the policy decisions when regulating private conduct, it may authorize another branch to “fill up the details.” Second, once Congress prescribes the rule governing private conduct, it may make the application of that rule depend on executive fact-finding. Third, Congress may assign the executive and judicial branches certain non-legislative responsibilities.</p>
<p id="fba44159-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the 1930s, federal statutes granting authority to the executive were comparatively modest and usually easily upheld. But then the federal government began to grow explosively. And with the proliferation of new executive programs came new questions about the scope of congressional delegations. Twice the Court responded by striking down statutes for violating the separation of powers. (A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan.)</p>
<p id="fba4415a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Schechter Poultry</i> and <i>Panama Refining</i>, Congress responded by writing a second wave of New Deal legislation more “[c]arefully crafted” to avoid the kind of problems that sank these early statutes. And since that time the Court hasn’t held another statute to violate the separation of powers in the same way. Of course, no one thinks that the Court’s quiescence can be attributed to an <span title="303" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-303">p. 303</span>unwavering new tradition of more scrupulously drawn statutes. Some lament that the real cause may have to do with a mistaken “case of death by association” because <i>Schechter Poultry</i> and <i>Panama Refining</i> happened to be handed down during the same era as certain of the Court’s now-discredited substantive due process decisions. But maybe the most likely explanation of all lies in the story of the evolving “intelligible principle” doctrine.</p>
<p id="fba4415b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court first used that phrase in 1928 in J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, where it remarked that a statute “lay[ing] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the [executive official] is directed to conform” satisfies the separation of powers.</p>
<p id="fba4415c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still, it’s undeniable that the “intelligible principle” remark eventually began to take on a life of its own. This mutated version of the “intelligible principle” remark has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution, in history, or even in the decision from which it was plucked.</p>
<p id="fba4415d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To leave this aspect of the constitutional structure alone undefended would serve only to accelerate the flight of power from the legislative to the executive branch, turning the latter into a vortex of authority that was constitutionally reserved for the people’s representatives in order to protect their liberties.</p>

<p id="fba4686f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Returning to SORNA with this understanding of our charge in hand, problems quickly emerge. Start with this one: It’s hard to see how SORNA leaves the Attorney General with only details to fill up. As the government itself admitted in <i>Reynolds</i>, SORNA leaves the Attorney General free to impose on 500,000 pre-Act offenders all of the statute’s requirements, some of them, or none of them. The Attorney General may choose which pre-Act offenders to subject to the Act. And he is free to change his mind at any point or over the course of different political administrations. In the end, there isn’t a single policy decision concerning pre-Act offenders on which Congress even tried to speak, and not a single other case where we have upheld executive authority over matters like these on the ground they constitute mere “details.” This much appears to have been deliberate, too. Because members of Congress could not reach consensus on the treatment of pre-Act offenders, it seems this was one of those situations where they found it expedient to hand off the job to the executive and direct there the blame for any later problems that might emerge.</p>
<p id="fba46870-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be easy enough to let this case go. After all, sex offenders are one of the most disfavored groups in our society. But the rule that prevents Congress from giving the executive <i>carte blanche</i> to write laws for sex offenders is the same rule that protects everyone else. Nor is it hard to imagine how the power at issue in this case — the power of a prosecutor to require a group to register with the government on pain of weighty criminal penalties — could be abused in other settings. To allow the nation’s chief law enforcement officer to write the criminal laws he is charged with enforcing — to “‘unit[e]’” the “‘legislative and executive powers . . . in the same person’” — would be to mark the end of any meaningful enforcement of our separation of powers and invite the tyranny of <span title="304" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-304">p. 304</span>the majority that follows when lawmaking and law enforcement responsibilities are united in the same hands.</p>
<p id="fba46871-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor would enforcing the Constitution’s demands spell doom for what some call the “administrative state.” The separation of powers does not prohibit any particular policy outcome, let alone dictate any conclusion about the proper size and scope of government. Instead, it is a procedural guarantee that requires Congress to assemble a social consensus before choosing our nation’s course on policy questions like those implicated by SORNA. What is more, Congress is hardly bereft of options to accomplish all it might wish to achieve. It may always authorize executive branch officials to fill in even a large number of details, to find facts that trigger the generally applicable rule of conduct specified in a statute, or to exercise non-legislative powers. Congress can also commission agencies or other experts to study and recommend legislative language. Respecting the separation of powers forecloses no substantive outcomes. It only requires us to respect along the way one of the most vital of the procedural protections of individual liberty found in our Constitution.</p>
<p id="fba46872-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only real surprise is that the Court fails to make good on the consequences the government invited, resolving nothing and deferring everything. In a future case with a full panel, I remain hopeful that the Court may yet recognize that, while Congress can enlist considerable assistance from the executive branch in filling up details and finding facts, it may never hand off to the nation’s chief prosecutor the power to write his own criminal code. That “is delegation running riot.”</p>

Congress, of course, could enact a law overturning an agency’s rule, but requiring legislative action obviously limits the circumstances in which Congress can or will exercise its checking function.</p>
<p id="fba46876-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, in the 1930s, not coincidentally corresponding to the time of great growth in federal administrative agencies, Congress created the “legislative veto” as a check on the actions of administrative agencies. Congress included in statutes provisions authorizing Congress or one of its houses or committees to overturn an agency’s action by doing something less than adopting a new law. A typical form of a legislative veto provision authorized Congress to overturn an agency’s decision by a resolution of one house of Congress. Legislative vetoes also took the form of overturning agency rules by resolution of both houses of Congress or even by action of a congressional committee. Nearly 200 federal laws contained legislative veto provisions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104D8_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N104D8_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">7</a></span></p>

He was lawfully admitted to the United States in 1966 on a nonimmigrant student visa. His visa expired on June 30, 1972. On October 11, 1973, the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered Chadha to show cause why he should not be deported for having “remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted.” Pursuant to §242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), a deportation hearing was held before an immigration judge on January 11, 1974. Chadha conceded that he was deportable for overstaying his visa and the hearing was adjourned to enable him to file an application for suspension of deportation under §244(a)(1) of the Act.</p>
<p id="fba48f92-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Chadha submitted his application for suspension of deportation, the deportation hearing was resumed on February 7, 1974. On the basis of evidence adduced at the hearing, affidavits submitted with the application, and the results of a character investigation conducted by the INS, the immigration judge, on June 25, 1974, ordered that Chadha’s deportation be suspended. The immigration judge found that Chadha met the requirements of §244(a)(1): he had resided continuously in the United States for over seven years, was of good moral character, and would suffer “extreme hardship” if deported.</p>
<p id="fba48f93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to §244(c)(1) of the Act, the immigration judge suspended Chadha’s deportation and a report of the suspension was transmitted to Congress. Once the Attorney General’s recommendation for suspension of Chadha’s deportation was conveyed to Congress [by resolution of either the Senate or the House of Representatives], Congress had the power under §244(c)(2) of the Act to veto the Attorney General’s determination that Chadha should not be deported.</p>
<p id="fba48f94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 12, 1975, Representative Eilberg, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and International Law, introduced a resolution opposing “the granting of permanent residence in the United States to [six] aliens,” including Chadha. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On December 16, 1975, the resolution was discharged from further consideration by the House Committee on the Judiciary and submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote. The resolution had not been printed and was not made available to other Members of the House prior to or at the time it was voted on. So far as the record before us shows, the House consideration of the resolution was based on Representative Eilberg’s statement from the floor that “[i]t was the feeling of the committee, after reviewing 340 cases, that the <span title="306" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-306">p. 306</span>aliens contained in the resolution [Chadha and five others] did not meet these statutory requirements, particularly as it relates to hardship; and it is the opinion of the committee that their deportation should not be suspended.” The resolution was passed without debate or recorded vote. Since the House action was pursuant to §244(c)(2), the resolution was not treated as an Article I legislative act; it was not submitted to the Senate or presented to the President for his action.</p>

Convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives — or the hallmarks — of democratic government and our inquiry is sharpened rather than blunted by the fact that Congressional veto provisions are appearing with increasing frequency in statutes which delegate authority to executive and independent agencies: “Since 1932, when the first veto provision was enacted into law, 295 congressional veto-type procedures have been inserted in 196 different statutes as follows: from 1932 to 1939, five statutes were affected; from 1940-49, nineteen statutes; between 1950-59, thirty-four statutes; and from 1960-69, forty-nine. From the year 1970 through 1975, at least one hundred sixty-three such provisions were included in eighty-nine laws.”</p>
<p id="fba48f98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Explicit and unambiguous provisions of the Constitution prescribe and define the respective functions of the Congress and of the Executive in the legislative process. Since the precise terms of those familiar provisions are critical to the resolution of this case, we set them out verbatim. Art. I provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba48f99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” “Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; . . .” “Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.”</p>

<p id="fba4b6ac-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The records of the Constitutional Convention reveal that the requirement that all legislation be presented to the President before becoming law was uniformly accepted by the framers.

<p id="fba4b6ad-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision to provide the President with a limited and qualified power to nullify proposed legislation by veto was based on the profound conviction of the framers that the powers conferred on Congress were the powers to be most carefully circumscribed. It is beyond doubt that lawmaking was a power to be shared by both Houses and the President. The President’s role in the lawmaking process also reflects the framers’ careful efforts to check whatever propensity a particular Congress might have to enact oppressive, improvident, or ill-considered measures.</p>

<p id="fba4b6af-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bicameral requirement of Art. I, §1, 7 was of scarcely less concern to the framers than was the Presidential veto and indeed the two concepts are interdependent. By providing that no law could take effect without the concurrence of the prescribed majority of the Members of both Houses, the framers reemphasized their belief, already remarked upon in connection with the Presentment Clauses, that legislation should not be enacted unless it has been carefully and fully considered by the Nation’s elected officials.</p>
<p id="fba4b6b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However familiar, it is useful to recall that apart from their fear that special interests could be favored at the expense of public needs, the framers were also concerned, although not of one mind, over the apprehensions of the smaller states. Those states feared a commonality of interest among the larger states would work to their disadvantage; representatives of the larger states, on the other hand, were skeptical of a legislature that could pass laws favoring a minority of the people. It need hardly be repeated here that the Great Compromise, under which one House was viewed as representing the people and the other the states, allayed the fears of both the large and small states.</p>
<p id="fba4b6b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see therefore that the framers were acutely conscious that the bicameral requirement and the Presentment Clauses would serve essential constitutional functions. The President’s participation in the legislative process was to protect the Executive Branch from Congress and to protect the whole people from improvident laws. The division of the Congress into two distinctive bodies assures that the legislative power would be exercised only after opportunity for full study and debate in separate settings. The President’s unilateral veto power, in turn, was limited by the power of two thirds of both Houses of Congress to overrule a veto thereby precluding final arbitrary action of one person. It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative action in Art. I, §1, 7 represents the framers’ decision that the legislative power of the Federal government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure.</p>

In purporting to exercise power defined in Art. I, §8, cl. 4 to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” the House took action that had the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties and relations of persons, including the Attorney General, Executive Branch officials and Chadha, all outside the legislative branch. Section 244(c)(2) purports to authorize one House of Congress to require the Attorney General to deport an individual alien whose deportation otherwise would be canceled under §244. The one-House veto operated in this case to overrule the Attorney General and mandate Chadha’s deportation; absent the House action, Chadha would remain in the United States. Congress has acted and its action has altered Chadha’s status.</p>
<p id="fba4b6b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nature of the decision implemented by the one-House veto in this case further manifests its legislative character. After long experience with the clumsy, time consuming private bill procedure, Congress made a deliberate choice to delegate to the Executive Branch, and specifically to the Attorney General, the authority to allow deportable aliens to remain in this country in certain specified circumstances. It is not disputed that this choice to delegate authority is precisely the kind of decision that can be implemented only in accordance with the procedures set out in Art. I. Disagreement with the Attorney General’s decision on Chadha’s deportation — that is, Congress’s decision to deport Chadha — no less than Congress’s original choice to delegate to the Attorney General the authority to make that decision, involves determinations of policy that Congress can implement in only one way; bicameral passage followed by presentment to the President. Congress must abide by its delegation of authority until that delegation is legislatively altered or revoked.</p>
<p id="fba4b6b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we see that when the framers intended to authorize either House of Congress to act alone and outside of its prescribed bicameral legislative role, they narrowly and precisely defined the procedure for such action. There are but four provisions in the Constitution, explicit and unambiguous, by which one House may act alone with the unreviewable force of law, not subject to the President’s veto:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba4b6b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) The House of Representatives alone was given the power to initiate impeachments. Art. I, §2, cl. 6;</p>

<p id="fba4ddcb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clearly, when the Draftsmen sought to confer special powers on one House, independent of the other House, or of the President, they did so in explicit, unambiguous terms. These carefully defined exceptions from presentment and bicameralism underscore the difference between the legislative functions of Congress and other unilateral but important and binding one-House acts provided for in the Constitution. These exceptions are narrow, explicit, and <span title="309" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-309">p. 309</span>separately justified; none of them authorize the action challenged here. On the contrary, they provide further support for the conclusion that Congressional authority is not to be implied and for the conclusion that the veto provided for in §244(c)(2) is not authorized by the constitutional design of the powers of the Legislative Branch.</p>
<p id="fba4ddcc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since it is clear that the action by the House under §244(c)(2) was not within any of the express constitutional exceptions authorizing one House to act alone, and equally clear that it was an exercise of legislative power, that action was subject to the standards prescribed in Article I. The bicameral requirement, the Presentment Clauses, the President’s veto, and Congress’s power to override a veto were intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve those checks, and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded. To accomplish what has been attempted by one House of Congress in this case requires action in conformity with the express procedures of the Constitution’s prescription for legislative action: passage by a majority of both Houses and presentment to the President.</p>
<p id="fba4ddcd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The choices we discern as having been made in the Constitutional Convention impose burdens on governmental processes that often seem clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable, but those hard choices were consciously made by men who had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked. There is no support in the Constitution or decisions of this Court for the proposition that the cumbersomeness and delays often encountered in complying with explicit Constitutional standards may be avoided, either by the Congress or by the President. With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="fba4ddce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Powell,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fba4ddcf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decision, based on the Presentment Clauses, Art. I, §7, cls. 2 and 3, apparently will invalidate every use of the legislative veto. The breadth of this holding gives one pause. Congress has included the veto in literally hundreds of statutes, dating back to the 1930s. Congress clearly views this procedure as essential to controlling the delegation of power to administrative agencies. One reasonably may disagree with Congress’ assessment of the veto’s utility, but the respect due its judgment as a coordinate branch of Government cautions that our holding should be no more extensive than necessary to decide this case. In my view, the case may be decided on a narrower ground. When Congress finds that a particular person does not satisfy the statutory criteria for permanent residence in this country it has assumed a judicial function in violation of the principle of separation of powers. Accordingly, I concur only in the judgment.</p>
<p id="fba4ddd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Functionally, the doctrine [of separation of powers] may be violated in two ways. One branch may interfere impermissibly with the other’s performance of its constitutionally assigned function. <i>See</i> Nixon v. Administrator of General Services (1977); United States v. Nixon (1974). Alternatively, the doctrine may be violated when one branch assumes a function that more properly is entrusted to another. <i>See</i> Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer. This case presents the latter situation.</p>
<p id="fba4ddd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="310" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-310">p. 310</span>On its face, the House’s action appears clearly adjudicatory. The House did not enact a general rule; rather it made its own determination that six specific persons did not comply with certain statutory criteria. It thus undertook the type of decision that traditionally has been left to other branches. Even if the House did not make a de novo determination, but simply reviewed the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s findings, it still assumed a function ordinarily entrusted to the federal courts. Where, as here, Congress has exercised a power “that cannot possibly be regarded as merely in aid of the legislative function of Congress,” the decisions of this Court have held that Congress impermissibly assumed a function that the Constitution entrusted to another branch.</p>
<p id="fba4ddd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impropriety of the House’s assumption of this function is confirmed by the fact that its action raises the very danger the framers sought to avoid — the exercise of unchecked power. In deciding whether Chadha deserves to be deported, Congress is not subject to any internal constraints that prevent it from arbitrarily depriving him of the right to remain in this country. Unlike the judiciary or an administrative agency, Congress is not bound by established substantive rules. Nor is it subject to the procedural safeguards, such as the right to counsel and a hearing before an impartial tribunal, that are present when a court or an agency adjudicates individual rights. The only effective constraint on Congress’s power is political, but Congress is most accountable politically when it prescribes rules of general applicability. When it decides rights of specific persons, those rights are subject to “the tyranny of a shifting majority.”</p>
<p id="fba4ddd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, when Congress undertook to apply its rules to Chadha, it exceeded the scope of its constitutionally prescribed authority. I would not reach the broader question whether legislative vetoes are invalid under the Presentment Clauses.</p>

<p id="fba504e5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court not only invalidates §244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but also sounds the death knell for nearly 200 other statutory provisions in which Congress has reserved a “legislative veto.” For this reason, the Court’s decision is of surpassing importance. And it is for this reason that the Court would have been well-advised to decide the case, if possible, on the narrower grounds of separation of powers, leaving for full consideration the constitutionality of other congressional review statutes operating on such varied matters as war powers and agency rulemaking, some of which concern the independent regulatory agencies.</p>
<p id="fba504e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prominence of the legislative veto mechanism in our contemporary political system and its importance to Congress can hardly be overstated. It has become a central means by which Congress secures the accountability of executive and independent agencies. Without the legislative veto, Congress is faced with a Hobson’s choice: either to refrain from delegating the necessary authority, leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances across the entire policy landscape, or in the alternative, to abdicate its law-making function to the executive branch and independent agencies. To choose the former leaves major national problems unresolved; to opt for the latter risks unaccountable policymaking by those not elected to fill that role. Accordingly, over the past five decades, the legislative veto has been placed in nearly 200 statutes. The device is known in every field of governmental concern: reorganization, budgets, foreign affairs, war powers, and regulation of trade, safety, energy, the environment and the economy.</p>
<p id="fba504e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="311" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-311">p. 311</span>[T]he legislative veto is more than “efficient, convenient, and useful.” It is an important if not indispensable political invention that allows the President and Congress to resolve major constitutional and policy differences, assures the accountability of independent regulatory agencies, and preserves Congress’ control over lawmaking. Perhaps there are other means of accommodation and accountability, but the increasing reliance of Congress upon the legislative veto suggests that the alternatives to which Congress must now turn are not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p id="fba504e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of the legislative veto also makes clear that it has not been a sword with which Congress has struck out to aggrandize itself at the expense of the other branches — the concerns of Madison and Hamilton. Rather, the veto has been a means of defense, a reservation of ultimate authority necessary if Congress is to fulfill its designated role under Article I as the nation’s lawmaker. While the President has often objected to particular legislative vetoes, generally those left in the hands of congressional committees, the Executive has more often agreed to legislative review as the price for a broad delegation of authority. To be sure, the President may have preferred unrestricted power, but that could be precisely why Congress thought it essential to retain a check on the exercise of delegated authority.</p>
<p id="fba504e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all these reasons, the apparent sweep of the Court’s decision today is regrettable. The Court’s Article I analysis appears to invalidate all legislative vetoes irrespective of form or subject. Because the legislative veto is commonly found as a check upon rulemaking by administrative agencies and upon broad-based policy decisions of the Executive Branch, it is particularly unfortunate that the Court reaches its decision in a case involving the exercise of a veto over deportation decisions regarding particular individuals. Courts should always be wary of striking statutes as unconstitutional; to strike an entire class of statutes based on consideration of a somewhat atypical and more-readily indictable exemplar of the class is irresponsible.</p>
<p id="fba504ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reality of the situation is that the constitutional question posed today is one of immense difficulty over which the executive and legislative branches — as well as scholars and judges — have understandably disagreed. That disagreement stems from the silence of the Constitution on the precise question: The Constitution does not directly authorize or prohibit the legislative veto. Thus, our task should be to determine whether the legislative veto is consistent with the purposes of Art. I and the principles of Separation of Powers which are reflected in that Article and throughout the Constitution. We should not find the lack of a specific constitutional authorization for the legislative veto surprising, and I would not infer disapproval of the mechanism from its absence. From the summer of 1787 to the present the government of the United States has become an endeavor far beyond the contemplation of the framers. Only within the last half century has the complexity and size of the Federal Government’s responsibilities grown so greatly that the Congress must rely on the legislative veto as the most effective if not the only means to insure their role as the nation’s lawmakers. But the wisdom of the framers was to anticipate that the nation would grow and new problems of governance would require different solutions. Accordingly, our Federal Government was intentionally chartered with the flexibility to respond to contemporary needs without losing sight of fundamental democratic principles.</p>
<p id="fba504eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to exercise a legislative veto is not the power to write new law without bicameral approval or presidential consideration. The veto must be authorized by statute and may only negative what an Executive department or independent agency has proposed.

<p id="fba504ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central concern of the presentation and bicameralism requirements of Article I is that when a departure from the legal status quo is undertaken, it is done with the approval of the President and both Houses of Congress — or, in the event of a presidential veto, a two-thirds majority in both Houses. This interest is fully satisfied by the operation of §244(c)(2). The President’s approval is found in the Attorney General’s action in recommending to Congress that the deportation order for a given alien be suspended. The House and the Senate indicate their approval of the Executive’s action by not passing a resolution of disapproval within the statutory period. Thus, a change in the legal status quo — the deportability of the alien — is consummated only with the approval of each of the three relevant actors. The disagreement of any one of the three maintains the alien’s pre-existing status: the Executive may choose not to recommend suspension; the House and Senate may each veto the recommendation. The effect on the rights and obligations of the affected individuals and upon the legislative system is precisely the same as if a private bill were introduced but failed to receive the necessary approval.</p>
<p id="fba504ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus understood, §244(c)(2) fully effectuates the purposes of the bicameralism and presentation requirements. I regret that I am in disagreement with my colleagues on the fundamental questions that this case presents. But even more I regret the destructive scope of the Court’s holding. It reflects a profoundly different conception of the Constitution than that held by the Courts which sanctioned the modern administrative state. Today’s decision strikes down in one fell swoop provisions in more laws enacted by Congress than the Court has cumulatively invalidated in its history. I fear it will now be more difficult “to insure that the fundamental policy decisions in our society will be made not by an appointed official but by the body immediately responsible to the people,” Arizona v. California (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting). I must dissent.</p>

<p id="fba504ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Chadha</i> involved a legislative veto of an adjudicatory proceeding; Congress, by resolution of the House of Representatives, overturned an immigration judge’s decision to allow Chadha to remain in the country. Almost immediately after <i>Chadha</i>, the Court extended its holding to preclude legislative vetoes of agency rules. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Process Gas Consumers Group v. Consumers Energy Council of America, 463 U.S. 1216 (1983). It is thus clearly established that if Congress wants to overturn an executive action there must be bicameralism, passage by both houses of Congress, and presentment, giving the bill to the President for signature or veto. Anything less is a legislative veto and legislative vetoes are unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="fba52c01-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What other mechanisms exist to check administrative agencies and are they sufficient? Congress can control administrative agencies through statutes. For instance, laws can be enacted directing agencies to perform certain tasks or denying them authority in particular areas. Also, Congress can overturn agency decisions by statute, following the prescribed procedures for bicameralism and <span title="313" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-313">p. 313</span>presentment.

<p id="fba52c02-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, Congress controls the budget of administrative agencies and can use this to exercise an important check on their work.

<p id="fba52c03-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another important check on agencies is the appointment and removal power. The president’s authority to select members of agencies, subject to confirmation by the Senate, often directs the conduct of the agencies. Also, the president’s power to remove agency officials is another check. The appointment and removal power have generated many constitutional issues concerning separation of powers and are worth examining.</p>

<p id="fba5531e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents us with a challenge to the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. We hold today that these provisions of the Act do not violate the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the limitations of Article III, nor do they impermissibly interfere with the President’s authority under Article II in violation of the constitutional principle of separation of powers.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fba5531f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">I</p></div>
<p id="fba55320-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Briefly stated, Title VI of the Ethics in Government Act allows for the appointment of an “independent counsel” to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute certain high-ranking Government officials for violations of federal criminal laws. The Act requires the Attorney General, upon receipt of information that he determines is “sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether any person [covered by the Act] may have violated any Federal criminal law,” to conduct a preliminary investigation of the matter. When the Attorney General has completed this investigation, or 90 days has elapsed, he is required to report to a special court (the Special Division) created by the Act “for the purpose of appointing <span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-314">p. 314</span>independent counsels.” If the Attorney General determines that “there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted,” then he must notify the Special Division of this result. In such a case, “the division of the court shall have no power to appoint an independent counsel.”</p>
<p id="fba55321-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, however, the Attorney General has determined that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted,” then he “shall apply to the division of the court for the appointment of an independent counsel.” Upon receiving this application, the Special Division “shall appoint an appropriate independent counsel and shall define that independent counsel’s prosecutorial jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="fba55322-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to all matters within the independent counsel’s jurisdiction, the Act grants the counsel “full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and any other officer or employee of the Department of Justice.” Under §594(a)(9), the counsel’s powers include “initiating and conducting prosecutions in any court of competent jurisdiction, framing and signing indictments, filing informations, and handling all aspects of any case, in the name of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fba55323-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two statutory provisions govern the length of an independent counsel’s tenure in office. The first defines the procedure for removing an independent counsel. Section 596(a)(1) provides: “An independent counsel appointed under this chapter may be removed from office, other than by impeachment and conviction, only by the personal action of the Attorney General and only for good cause, physical disability, mental incapacity, or any other condition that substantially impairs the performance of such independent counsel’s duties.”</p>
<p id="fba55324-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other provision governing the tenure of the independent counsel defines the procedures for “terminating” the counsel’s office. Under §596(b)(1), the office of an independent counsel terminates when he or she notifies the Attorney General that he or she has completed or substantially completed any investigations or prosecutions undertaken pursuant to the Act. In addition, the Special Division, acting either on its own or on the suggestion of the Attorney General, may terminate the office of an independent counsel at any time if it finds that “the investigation of all matters within the prosecutorial jurisdiction of such independent counsel . . . have been completed or so substantially completed that it would be appropriate for the Department of Justice to complete such investigations and prosecutions.”</p>
<p id="fba55325-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Act provides for congressional oversight of the activities of independent counsel. An independent counsel may from time to time send Congress statements or reports on his or her activities.</p>

<p id="fba55327-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Appointments Clause of Article II reads as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fba55328-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.</p>
</div>
<p id="fba55329-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="315" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-315">p. 315</span>U.S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2.</p>
<p id="fba5532a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties do not dispute that “[t]he Constitution for purposes of appointment . . . divides all its officers into two classes.” As we stated in Buckley v. Valeo (1976): “[P]rincipal officers are selected by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Inferior officers Congress may allow to be appointed by the President alone, by the heads of departments, or by the Judiciary.” The initial question is, accordingly, whether appellant is an “inferior” or a “principal” officer. If she is the latter, as the Court of Appeals concluded, then the Act is in violation of the Appointments Clause.</p>
<p id="fba5532b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The line between “inferior” and “principal” officers is one that is far from clear, and the framers provided little guidance into where it should be drawn. We need not attempt here to decide exactly where the line falls between the two types of officers, because in our view appellant clearly falls on the “inferior officer” side of that line. Several factors lead to this conclusion.</p>
<p id="fba5532c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, appellant is subject to removal by a higher Executive Branch official. Although appellant may not be “subordinate” to the Attorney General (and the President) insofar as she possesses a degree of independent discretion to exercise the powers delegated to her under the Act, the fact that she can be removed by the Attorney General indicates that she is to some degree “inferior” in rank and authority. Second, appellant is empowered by the Act to perform only certain, limited duties. An independent counsel’s role is restricted primarily to investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution for certain federal crimes. Admittedly, the Act delegates to appellant “full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice,” but this grant of authority does not include any authority to formulate policy for the Government or the Executive Branch, nor does it give appellant any administrative duties outside of those necessary to operate her office. The Act specifically provides that in policy matters appellant is to comply to the extent possible with the policies of the Department.</p>
<p id="fba5532d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, appellant’s office is limited in jurisdiction. Not only is the Act itself restricted in applicability to certain federal officials suspected of certain serious federal crimes, but an independent counsel can only act within the scope of the jurisdiction that has been granted by the Special Division pursuant to a request by the Attorney General. Finally, appellant’s office is limited in tenure. There is concededly no time limit on the appointment of a particular counsel. Nonetheless, the office of independent counsel is “temporary” in the sense that an independent counsel is appointed essentially to accomplish a single task, and when that task is over the office is terminated, either by the counsel herself or by action of the Special Division. Unlike other prosecutors, appellant has no ongoing responsibilities that extend beyond the accomplishment of the mission that she was appointed for and authorized by the Special Division to undertake. In our view, these factors relating to the “ideas of tenure, duration . . . and duties” of the independent counsel are sufficient to establish that appellant is an “inferior” officer in the constitutional sense.</p>
<p id="fba57a3e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia,</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="fba57a3f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is what this suit is about. Power. The allocation of power among Congress, the President, and the courts in such fashion as to preserve the equilibrium the Constitution sought to establish — so that “a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department,” Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison), <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>can effectively be resisted. Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep’s clothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effect important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately evident, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive analysis. But this wolf comes as a wolf.</p>
<p id="fba57a40-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To repeat, Article II, §1, cl. 1, of the Constitution provides: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fba57a41-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power. It seems to me, therefore, that the decision of the Court of Appeals invalidating the present statute must be upheld on fundamental separation-of-powers principles if the following two questions are answered affirmatively: (1) Is the conduct of a criminal prosecution (and of an investigation to decide whether to prosecute) the exercise of purely executive power? (2) Does the statute deprive the President of the United States of exclusive control over the exercise of that power? Surprising to say, the Court appears to concede an affirmative answer to both questions, but seeks to avoid the inevitable conclusion that since the statute vests some purely executive power in a person who is not the President of the United States it is void.</p>
<p id="fba57a42-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concedes that “[t]here is no real dispute that the functions performed by the independent counsel are ‘executive,’” though it qualifies that concession by adding “in the sense that they are law enforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by officials within the Executive Branch.” The qualifier adds nothing but atmosphere. In what other sense can one identify “the executive Power” that is supposed to be vested in the President (unless it includes everything the Executive Branch is given to do) except by reference to what has always and everywhere — if conducted by government at all — been conducted never by the legislature, never by the courts, and always by the executive. There is no possible doubt that the independent counsel’s functions fit this description. She is vested with the “full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice [and] the Attorney General.” Governmental investigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive function.</p>
<p id="fba57a43-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the second question, whether the statute before us deprives the President of exclusive control over that quintessentially executive activity: The Court does not, and could not possibly, assert that it does not. That is indeed the whole object of the statute. Instead, the Court points out that the President, through his Attorney General, has at least some control. That concession is alone enough to invalidate the statute, but I cannot refrain from pointing out that the Court greatly exaggerates the extent of that “some” Presidential control. “Most importan[t]” among these controls, the Court asserts, is the Attorney General’s “power to remove the counsel for ‘good cause.’” This is somewhat like referring to shackles as an effective means of locomotion.</p>
<p id="fba57a44-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The utter incompatibility of the Court’s approach with our constitutional traditions can be made more clear, perhaps, by applying it to the powers of the other two branches. Is it conceivable that if Congress passed a statute depriving itself of less than full and entire control over some insignificant area of legislation, we would inquire whether the matter was “so central to the functioning of the Legislative Branch” as really to require complete control, or whether the statute gives Congress “sufficient control over the surrogate legislator to ensure that Congress is able to perform its constitutionally assigned duties”? Of <span title="317" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-317">p. 317</span>course we would have none of that. Once we determined that a purely legislative power was at issue we would require it to be exercised, wholly and entirely, by Congress. Or to bring the point closer to home, consider a statute giving to non-Article III judges just a tiny bit of purely judicial power in a relatively insignificant field, with substantial control, though not total control, in the courts — perhaps “clear error” review, which would be a fair judicial equivalent of the Attorney General’s “for cause” removal power here. Is there any doubt that we would not pause to inquire whether the matter was “so central to the functioning of the Judicial Branch” as really to require complete control, or whether we retained “sufficient control over the matters to be decided that we are able to perform our constitutionally assigned duties”? We would say that our “constitutionally assigned duties” include complete control over all exercises of the judicial power. We should say here that the President’s constitutionally assigned duties include complete control over investigation and prosecution of violations of the law, and that the inexorable command of Article II is clear and definite: the executive power must be vested in the President of the United States.</p>
<p id="fba57a45-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it unthinkable that the President should have such exclusive power, even when alleged crimes by him or his close associates are at issue? No more so than that Congress should have the exclusive power of legislation, even when what is at issue is its own exemption from the burdens of certain laws. No more so than that this Court should have the exclusive power to pronounce the final decision on justiciable cases and controversies, even those pertaining to the constitutionality of a statute reducing the salaries of the Justices. A system of separate and coordinate powers necessarily involves an acceptance of exclusive power that can theoretically be abused. As we reiterate this very day, “[i]t is a truism that constitutional protections have costs.” While the separation of powers may prevent us from righting every wrong, it does so in order to ensure that we do not lose liberty.</p>
<p id="fba57a46-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, this statute does deprive the President of substantial control over the prosecutory functions performed by the independent counsel, and it does substantially affect the balance of powers. That the Court could possibly conclude otherwise demonstrates both the wisdom of our former constitutional system, in which the degree of reduced control and political impairment were irrelevant, since all purely executive power had to be in the President; and the folly of the new system of standardless judicial allocation of powers we adopt today.</p>

<p id="fba57a47-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authority for creating an Independent Counsel, the Ethics in Government Act, expired in 1999. After the investigation of President Bill Clinton by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, described more fully in the last section of this chapter, Congress simply let the Act expire and did not renew the authority for the creation of an Independent Counsel. Some believe that this is a vindication for the views expressed by Justice Scalia in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson, while others contend that the expiration of the authority for an Independent Counsel is a serious mistake that will be regretted when there are future scandals involving the President or high-level executive officials.</p>
<p id="fba57a48-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has imposed one important limit on who may possess the appointment power: The Court has held that Congress cannot give the appointment <span title="318" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-318">p. 318</span>power to itself or to its officers. Article II specifies several possibilities as to who may possess the appointment power; Congress is not among them. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), the Court held unconstitutional a federal law that empowered the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate to appoint four of the six members of the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p id="fba5a159-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court emphasized the text of Article II, which specifies who may possess the appointment power. The Court said that under Article II, Congress could vest the appointment power for inferior offices in the President, the heads of departments, or the lower federal courts. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tem of the Senate are obviously none of these and therefore the Court found that they could not possess the appointment power.</p>
<p id="fba5a15a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most recent case concerning the definition of “officers” was Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018). In <i>Lucia</i>, the Court considered whether administrative law judges should be regarded as “Officers of the United States” — as distinct from mere employees of the federal government — who must be appointed by the President, courts of law, or heads of departments.</p>
<p id="fba5a15b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted a proceeding against Raymond Lucia for deceiving prospective clients about a retirement savings strategy called “Buckets of Money.” The case was adjudicated by an administrative law judge (ALJ), who found Lucia guilty and imposed sanctions, including $300,000 in civil penalties and a lifetime bar from the investment industry.</p>
<p id="fba5a15c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his appeal, Lucia argued that the administrative appeal was invalid because the ALJ had not been constitutionally appointed. Lucia argued that ALJs are officers of the United States and subject to the appointments clause, and that the ALJ had not been appointed by the president, a court of law, or a head of department.</p>
<p id="fba5a15d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Kagan, writing for the majority, said that under Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), ALJs should be considered officers of the United States. In <i>Freytag</i>, the Court held that the special tax judges of the United States Tax Court are officers of the United States. The Court noted that they held a “continuing office” and exercised “significant discretion.”</p>
<p id="fba5a15e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Lucia</i> concluded that administrative law judges likewise hold continuing offices and exercise significant discretion. Justice Kagan, writing for the Court, explained: “<i>Freytag</i> says everything necessary to decide this case. To begin, the Commission’s ALJs, like the Tax Court’s STJs, hold a continuing office established by law. . . . Far from serving temporarily or episodically, SEC ALJs ‘receive[ ] a career appointment.’ Still more, the Commission’s ALJs exercise the same ‘significant discretion’ when carrying out the same ‘important functions’ as STJs do.”</p>
<p id="fba5a15f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court thus ruled that Lucia should get a new hearing before a properly appointed officer of the United States. This, of course, affects administrative law judges throughout the federal government. The SEC only has five ALJs, but the Social Security Administration has 1,500. It is hard to see how they would be any different from the ALJs at the SEC. That means Congress will have to decide whether to have them appointed by the President, the federal courts, or, most likely, the heads of departments.</p>
<p id="fba5a160-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Court also leaves open the definition of inferior officers, and this will invite litigation outside the ALJ context. What authority is enough to make <span title="319" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-319">p. 319</span>someone an officer of the United States? Also, once they are deemed “officers” this raises issues concerning the constitutionality of limits on removal. The Court did not address this issue, though it was briefed in the case and raised by Justice Breyer.</p>
<p id="fba5a161-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also recently dealt with another issue concerning the appointments power: When may the president make recess appointments?</p>

<p id="fba5c878-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily the President must obtain “the Advice and Consent of the Senate” before appointing an “Office[r] of the United States.” But the Recess Appointments Clause creates an exception. It gives the President alone the power “to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.” Art. II, §2, cl. 3. We here consider three questions about the application of this Clause.</p>
<p id="fba5c879-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first concerns the scope of the words “recess of the Senate.” Does that phrase refer only to an inter-session recess (<i>i.e.,</i> a break between formal sessions of Congress), or does it also include an intra-session recess, such as a summer recess in the midst of a session? We conclude that the Clause applies to both kinds of recess.</p>
<p id="fba5c87a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second question concerns the scope of the words “vacancies that may happen.” Does that phrase refer only to vacancies that first come into existence during a recess, or does it also include vacancies that arise prior to a recess but continue to exist during the recess? We conclude that the Clause applies to both kinds of vacancy.</p>
<p id="fba5c87b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third question concerns calculation of the length of a “recess.” The President made the appointments here at issue on January 4, 2012. At that time the Senate was in recess pursuant to a December 17, 2011, resolution providing for a series of brief recesses punctuated by “<i>pro forma</i> session[s],” with “no business . . . transacted,” every Tuesday and Friday through January 20, 2012. In calculating the length of a recess are we to ignore the <i>pro forma</i> sessions, thereby treating the series of brief recesses as a single, month-long recess? We conclude that we cannot ignore these <i>pro forma</i> sessions.</p>
<p id="fba5c87c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our answer to the third question means that, when the appointments before us took place, the Senate was in the midst of a 3-day recess. Three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the scope of the Clause. Thus we conclude that the President lacked the power to make the recess appointments here at issue.</p>

<p id="fba5c87e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case before us arises out of a labor dispute. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that a Pepsi-Cola distributor, Noel Canning, had unlawfully refused to reduce to writing and execute a collective-bargaining agreement with a labor union. The Board ordered the distributor to execute the agreement and to make employees whole for any losses.</p>

<p id="fba5c880-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three members in question were Sharon Block, Richard Griffin, and Terence Flynn. In 2011 the President had nominated each of them to the Board. As of January 2012, Flynn’s nomination had been pending in the Senate awaiting confirmation for approximately a year. The nominations of each of the other two had been pending for a few weeks. On January 4, 2012, the President, invoking the Recess Appointments Clause, appointed all three to the Board.</p>

<p id="fba5c882-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before turning to the specific questions presented, we shall mention two background considerations that we find relevant to all three. First, <i>the Recess Appointments Clause sets forth a subsidiary, not a primary, method for appointing officers of the United States</i>. [T]he Recess Appointments Clause reflects the tension between, on the one hand, the President’s continuous need for “the assistance of subordinates,” and, on the other, the Senate’s practice, particularly during the Republic’s early years, of meeting for a single brief session each year.</p>
<p id="fba5ee93-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, <i>in interpreting the Clause, we put significant weight upon historical practice</i>. There is a great deal of history to consider here. Presidents have made recess appointments since the beginning of the Republic. Their frequency suggests that the Senate and President have recognized that recess appointments can be both necessary and appropriate in certain circumstances. We have not previously interpreted the Clause, and, when doing so for the first time in more than 200 years, we must hesitate to upset the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of Government themselves have reached.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fba5ee94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">III</p></div>
<p id="fba5ee95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question concerns the scope of the phrase “<i>the recess</i> of the Senate.” The Constitution provides for congressional elections every two years. And the 2-year life of each elected Congress typically consists of two formal 1-year sessions, each separated from the next by an “intersession recess.” The Senate or the House of Representatives announces an inter-session recess by approving a resolution stating that it will “adjourn <i>sine die</i>,” <i>i.e.,</i> without specifying a date to return (in which case Congress will reconvene when the next formal session is scheduled to begin).</p>
<p id="fba5ee96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Senate and the House also take breaks in the midst of a session. The Senate or the House announces any such “intra-session recess” by adopting a resolution stating that it will “adjourn” to a fixed date, a few days or weeks or even months later. All agree that the phrase “the recess of the Senate” covers inter-session recesses. The question is whether it includes intra-session recesses as well.</p>
<p id="fba5ee97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the phrase “the recess” includes an intra-session recess of substantial length. Its words taken literally can refer to both types of recess. Founding-era dictionaries define the word “recess,” much as we do today, simply as “a period of cessation from usual work.”</p>
<p id="fba5ee98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="321" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-321">p. 321</span>We recognize that the word “the” in “<i>the</i> recess” might suggest that the phrase refers to the single break separating formal sessions of Congress. That is because the word “the” frequently (but not always) indicates “a particular thing.” But the word can also refer “to a term used generically or universally.” Reading “the” generically in this way, there is no linguistic problem applying the Clause’s phrase to both kinds of recess. And, in fact, the phrase “the recess” was used to refer to intra-session recesses at the time of the founding.</p>
<p id="fba5ee99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutional text is thus ambiguous. And we believe the Clause’s purpose demands the broader interpretation. The Clause gives the President authority to make appointments during “the recess of the Senate” so that the President can ensure the continued functioning of the Federal Government when the Senate is away. The Senate is equally away during both an inter-session and an intra-session recess, and its capacity to participate in the appointments process has nothing to do with the words it uses to signal its departure.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">History also offers strong support for the broad interpretation. In all, between the founding and the Great Depression, Congress took substantial intra-session breaks (other than holiday breaks) in four years: 1867, 1868, 1921, and 1929. And in each of those years the President made intra-session recess appointments.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since 1929, and particularly since the end of World War II, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks as it has taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks; Presidents have correspondingly made more intra-session recess appointments. Indeed, if we include military appointments, Presidents have made thousands of intra-session recess appointments.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is that restricting the Clause to inter-session recesses would frustrate its purpose. It would make the President’s recess-appointment power dependent on a formalistic distinction of Senate procedure. Moreover, the President has consistently and frequently interpreted the word “recess” to apply to intra-session recesses, and has acted on that interpretation. The Senate as a body has done nothing to deny the validity of this practice for at least three-quarters of a century. And three-quarters of a century of settled practice is long enough to entitle a practice to “great weight in a proper interpretation” of the constitutional provision.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The greater interpretive problem is determining how long a recess must be in order to fall within the Clause. Is a break of a week, or a day, or an hour too short to count as a “recess”? The Clause itself does not say. And Justice Scalia claims that this silence itself shows that the Framers intended the Clause to apply only to an inter-session recess.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree. For one thing, the most likely reason the Framers did not place a textual floor underneath the word “recess” is that they did not foresee the <i>need</i> for one. They might have expected that the Senate would meet for a single session lasting at most half a year. Moreover, the lack of a textual floor raises a problem that plagues <i>both</i> interpretations — Justice Scalia’s and ours. Today a brief inter-session recess is just as possible as a brief intra-session recess.</p>
<p id="fba5ee9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Solicitor General that a 3-day recess would be too short. A Senate recess that is so short that it does not require the consent of the House is not long enough to trigger the President’s recess-appointment power.</p>
<p id="fba5eea0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is not to say that the President may make recess appointments during any recess that is “more than three days.” The Recess Appointments Clause seeks to permit the Executive Branch to function smoothly when Congress is unavailable. And though Congress has taken short breaks for almost 200 years, <span title="322" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-322">p. 322</span>and there have been many thousands of recess appointments in that time, we have not found a single example of a recess appointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than 10 days.</p>
<p id="fba5eea1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we conclude that the phrase “the recess” applies to both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of the House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.</p>

<p id="fba615b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second question concerns the scope of the phrase “vacancies <i>that may happen</i> during the recess of the Senate.” All agree that the phrase applies to vacancies that initially occur during a recess. But does it also apply to vacancies that initially occur before a recess and continue to exist during the recess? In our view the phrase applies to both kinds of vacancy.</p>
<p id="fba615b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that the Clause’s language, read literally, permits, though it does not naturally favor, our broader interpretation. We concede that the most natural meaning of “happens” as applied to a “vacancy” (at least to a modern ear) is that the vacancy “happens” when it initially occurs. But that is not the only possible way to use the word.</p>
<p id="fba615b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, the linguistic question here is not whether the phrase can be, but whether it must be, read more narrowly. The question is whether the Clause is ambiguous. And the broader reading, we believe, is at least a permissible reading of a “‘doubtful’” phrase. We consequently go on to consider the Clause’s purpose and historical practice.</p>
<p id="fba615b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Clause’s purpose strongly supports the broader interpretation. That purpose is to permit the President to obtain the assistance of subordinate officers when the Senate, due to its recess, cannot confirm them.</p>
<p id="fba615b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, we recognize one important purpose-related consideration that argues in the opposite direction. A broad interpretation might permit a President to avoid Senate confirmations as a matter of course. If the Clause gives the President the power to “fill up all vacancies” that occur before, and continue to exist during, the Senate’s recess, a President might not submit any nominations to the Senate. He might simply wait for a recess and then provide all potential nominees with recess appointments. He might thereby routinely avoid the constitutional need to obtain the Senate’s “advice and consent.”</p>
<p id="fba615b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we concede that both interpretations carry with them some risk of undesirable consequences, we believe the narrower interpretation risks undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and more often. It would prevent the President from making any recess appointment that arose before a recess, no matter who the official, no matter how dire the need, no matter how uncontroversial the appointment, and no matter how late in the session the office fell vacant.</p>
<p id="fba615b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historical practice over the past 200 years strongly favors the broader interpretation. The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at least to President James Madison.</p>
<p id="fba615ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is that the President has consistently and frequently interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause to apply to vacancies that initially occur before, but continue to exist during, a recess of the Senate. The Senate as a body has not <span title="323" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-323">p. 323</span>countered this practice for nearly three-quarters of a century, perhaps longer. The tradition is long enough to entitle the practice “to great regard in determining the true construction” of the constitutional provision. And we are reluctant to upset this traditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presidents have believed existed and have exercised for so long.</p>
<p id="fba615bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of some linguistic ambiguity, the basic purpose of the Clause, and the historical practice we have described, we conclude that the phrase “all vacancies” includes vacancies that come into existence while the Senate is in session.</p>

<p id="fba615bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third question concerns the calculation of the length of the Senate’s “recess.” On December 17, 2011, the Senate by unanimous consent adopted a resolution to convene “<i>pro forma</i> session[s]” only, with “no business . . . transacted,” on every Tuesday and Friday from December 20, 2011, through January 20, 2012. At the end of each <i>pro forma</i> session, the Senate would “adjourn until” the following <i>pro forma</i> session. During that period, the Senate convened and adjourned as agreed. It held <i>pro forma</i> sessions on December 20, 23, 27, and 30, and on January 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 20; and at the end of each <i>pro forma</i> session, it adjourned until the time and date of the next.</p>
<p id="fba615be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President made the recess appointments before us on January 4, 2012, in between the January 3 and the January 6 <i>pro forma</i> sessions. We must determine the significance of these sessions — that is, whether, for purposes of the Clause, we should treat them as periods when the Senate was in session or as periods when it was in recess. If the former, the period between January 3 and January 6 was a 3-day recess, which is too short to trigger the President’s recess-appointment power. If the latter, however, then the 3-day period was part of a much longer recess during which the President did have the power to make recess appointments.</p>
<p id="fba615bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Solicitor General argues that we must treat the <i>pro forma</i> sessions as periods of recess. He says that these “sessions” were sessions in name only because the Senate was in recess as a <i>functional</i> matter. The Senate, he contends, remained in a single, unbroken recess from January 3, when the second session of the 112th Congress began by operation of the Twentieth Amendment, until January 23, when the Senate reconvened to do regular business.</p>
<p id="fba615c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, however, the <i>pro forma</i> sessions count as sessions, not as periods of recess. We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business. The Senate met that standard here.</p>
<p id="fba615c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard we apply is consistent with the Constitution’s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business. The Constitution explicitly empowers the Senate to “determine the Rules of its Proceedings.” Art. I, §5, cl. 2.</p>
<p id="fba615c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying this standard, we find that the <i>pro forma</i> sessions were sessions for purposes of the Clause. First, the Senate said it was in session. Second, the Senate’s rules make clear that during its <i>pro forma</i> sessions, despite its resolution that it would conduct no business, the Senate retained the power to conduct business. During any <i>pro forma</i> session, the Senate could have conducted business simply by passing a unanimous consent agreement. The Senate in fact conducts much of its business through unanimous consent.</p>

<p id="fba63cd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Recess Appointments Clause responds to a structural difference between the Executive and Legislative Branches: The Executive Branch is perpetually in operation, while the Legislature only acts in intervals separated by recesses. The purpose of the Clause is to allow the Executive to continue operating while the Senate is unavailable. We believe that the Clause’s text, standing alone, is ambiguous. It does not resolve whether the President may make appointments during intra-session recesses, or whether he may fill pre-recess vacancies. But the broader reading better serves the Clause’s structural function. Moreover, that broader reading is reinforced by centuries of history, which we are hesitant to disturb. We thus hold that the Constitution empowers the President to fill any existing vacancy during any recess — intra-session or inter-session — of sufficient length.</p>
<p id="fba63cd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Scalia would render illegitimate thousands of recess appointments reaching all the way back to the founding era. More than that: Calling the Clause an “anachronism,” he would basically read it out of the Constitution. He performs this act of judicial excision in the name of liberty. We fail to see how excising the Recess Appointments Clause preserves freedom.</p>
<p id="fba63cd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given our answer to the last question before us, we conclude that the Recess Appointments Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue.</p>

<p id="fba63cd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To prevent the President’s recess-appointment power from nullifying the Senate’s role in the appointment process, the Constitution cabins that power in two significant ways. First, it may be exercised only in “the Recess of the Senate,” that is, the intermission between two formal legislative sessions. Second, it may be used to fill only those vacancies that “happen during the Recess,” that is, offices that become vacant during that intermission. Both conditions are clear from the Constitution’s text and structure, and both were well understood at the founding. The Court of Appeals correctly held that the appointments here at issue are invalid because they did not meet either condition.</p>
<p id="fba63cd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decision transforms the recess-appointment power from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and specific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presidents against future Senates. To reach that result, the majority casts aside the plain, original meaning of the constitutional text in deference to late-arising historical practices that are ambiguous at best. The majority’s insistence on deferring to the Executive’s untenably broad interpretation of the power is in clear conflict with our precedent and forebodes a diminution of this Court’s role in controversies involving the separation of powers and the structure of government. I concur in the judgment only.</p>

<p id="fba63cdb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s majority disregards two overarching principles that ought to guide our consideration of the questions presented here.</p>
<p id="fba63cdc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the Constitution’s core, government-structuring provisions are no less critical to preserving liberty than are the later adopted provisions of the Bill <span title="325" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-325">p. 325</span>of Rights.

<p id="fba63cdd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second and relatedly, when questions involving the Constitution’s government-structuring provisions are presented in a justiciable case, it is the solemn responsibility of the Judicial Branch “to say what the law is.” This Court does not defer to the other branches’ resolution of such controversies; our role is in no way “lessened” because it might be said that “the two political branches are adjusting their own powers between themselves.” Since the separation of powers exists for the protection of individual liberty, its vitality “does not depend” on “whether ‘the encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment.’” Rather, policing the “enduring structure” of constitutional government when the political branches fail to do so is “one of the most vital functions of this Court.”</p>

I would hold that “the Recess” is the gap between sessions and that the appointments at issue here are invalid because they undisputedly were made <i>during</i> the Senate’s session. The Court’s contrary conclusion — that “the Recess” includes “breaks in the midst of a session,” — is inconsistent with the Constitution’s text and structure, and it requires judicial fabrication of vague, unadministrable limits on the recess-appointment power (thus defined) that overstep the judicial role.

<p id="fba663f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A sensible interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause should start by recognizing that the Clause uses the term “Recess” in contradistinction to the term “Session.” In the founding era, the terms “recess” and “session” had well-understood meanings in the marking-out of legislative time. The life of each elected Congress typically consisted (as it still does) of two or more formal sessions separated by adjournments “<i>sine die</i>,” that is, without a specified return date.</p>
<p id="fba663f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, in colloquial usage both words, “recess” and “session,” could take on alternative, less precise meanings. A session could include any short period when a legislature’s members were “assembled for business,” and a recess could refer to any brief “suspension” of legislative “business.” But as even the majority acknowledges, the Constitution’s use of “the word ‘the’ in ‘<i>the</i> [R]ecess’” tends to suggest “that the phrase refers to the single break separating formal sessions.”</p>
<p id="fba663f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides being linguistically unsound, the majority’s reading yields the strange result that an appointment made during a short break near the beginning of one official session will not terminate until the end of the <i>following</i> official session, enabling the appointment to last for up to two years.</p>
<p id="fba663f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To avoid the absurd results that follow from its colloquial reading of “the Recess,” the majority is forced to declare that some intra-session breaks—though undisputedly within the phrase’s colloquial meaning—are simply “too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause.” But it identifies no textual basis whatsoever for limiting the length of “the Recess,” nor does it point to any clear <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>standard for determining how short is too short. It is inconceivable that the Framers would have left the circumstances in which the President could exercise such a significant and potentially dangerous power so utterly indeterminate.</p>
<p id="fba663f5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And what about breaks longer than three days? The majority says that a break of four to nine days is “presumptively too short” but that the presumption may be rebutted in an “unusual circumstance,” such as a “national catastrophe . . . that renders the Senate unavailable but calls for an urgent response.”</p>
<p id="fba663f6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the many questions raised by the majority’s failure to articulate a standard could be answered, a larger question would remain: If the Constitution’s text empowers the President to make appointments during any break in the Senate’s proceedings, by what right does the majority subject the President’s exercise of that power to vague, court-crafted limitations with no textual basis? The majority claims its temporal guideposts are informed by executive practice, but a President’s self-restraint cannot “bind his successors by diminishing their powers.”</p>

<p id="fba663f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, the Constitution’s text and structure unambiguously refute the majority’s freewheeling interpretation of “the Recess.” It is not plausible that the Constitution uses that term in a sense that authorizes the President to make unilateral appointments during <i>any</i> break in Senate proceedings, subject only to hazy, atextual limits crafted by this Court centuries after ratification. The majority, however, insists that history “offers strong support” for its interpretation. The historical practice of the political branches is, of course, irrelevant when the Constitution is clear. But even if the Constitution were thought ambiguous on this point, history does not support the majority’s interpretation.</p>
<p id="fba663f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does all this amount to? In short: Intra-session recess appointments were virtually unheard of for the first 130 years of the Republic, were deemed unconstitutional by the first Attorney General to address them, were not openly defended by the Executive until 1921, were not made in significant numbers until after World War II, and have been repeatedly criticized as unconstitutional by Senators of both parties. It is astonishing for the majority to assert that this history lends “strong support,” to its interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. And the majority’s contention that recent executive practice in this area merits deference because the Senate has not done more to oppose it is utterly divorced from our precedent. “The structural interests protected by the Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch of Government but of the entire Republic,” and the Senate could not give away those protections even if it wanted to.</p>

<p id="fba663fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second question presented is whether vacancies that “happen during the Recess of the Senate,” which the President is empowered to fill with recess appointments, are (a) vacancies that <i>arise</i> during the recess, or (b) all vacancies that <i>exist</i> during the recess, regardless of when they arose. I would hold that the recess-appointment power is limited to vacancies that arise during the recess in which they are filled, and I would hold that the appointments at issue here — which undisputedly filled pre-recess vacancies — are invalid for that reason as well as for the reason that they were made during the session. The Court’s <span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-327">p. 327</span>contrary conclusion is inconsistent with the Constitution’s text and structure, and it further undermines the balance the Framers struck between Presidential and Senatorial power. Historical practice also fails to support the majority’s conclusion on this issue.</p>

<p id="fba663fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority concedes, “the most natural meaning of ‘happens’ as applied to a ‘vacancy’ . . . is that the vacancy ‘happens’ when it initially occurs.” The majority adds that this meaning is most natural “to a modern ear,” but it fails to show that founding-era ears heard it differently. “Happen” meant then, as it does now, “[t]o fall out; to chance; to come to pass.” Thus, a vacancy that <i>happened</i> during the Recess was most reasonably understood as one that <i>arose</i> during the recess. It was, of course, possible in certain contexts for the word “happen” to mean “happen to be” rather than “happen to occur,” as in the idiom “it so happens.” But that meaning is not at all natural when the subject is a vacancy, a state of affairs that comes into existence at a particular moment in time.</p>
<p id="fba663fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For another thing, the majority’s reading not only strains the Clause’s language but distorts its constitutional role, which was meant to be subordinate. As Hamilton explained, appointment with the advice and consent of the Senate was to be “the general mode of appointing officers of the United States.”</p>
<p id="fba663ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, however, the Clause had allowed the President to fill <i>all</i> pre-existing vacancies during the recess by granting commissions that would last throughout the following session, it would have been impossible to regard it — as the Framers plainly did — as a mere codicil to the Constitution’s principal, power-sharing scheme for filling federal offices. On the majority’s reading, the President would have had no need <i>ever</i> to seek the Senate’s advice and consent for his appointments: Whenever there was a fair prospect of the Senate’s rejecting his preferred nominee, the President could have appointed that individual unilaterally during the recess, allowed the appointment to expire at the end of the next session, renewed the appointment the following day, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. (Circumvention would have been especially easy if, as the majority also concludes, the President was authorized to make such appointments during any intra-session break of more than a few days.) It is unthinkable that such an obvious means for the Executive to expand its power would have been overlooked during the ratification debates.</p>

<p id="fba68b11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons just given, it is clear that the Constitution authorizes the President to fill unilaterally only those vacancies that arise during a recess, not every vacancy that happens to exist during a recess. Again, however, the majority says “[h]istorical practice” requires the broader interpretation. And again the majority is mistaken. Even if the Constitution were wrongly thought to be ambiguous on this point, a fair recounting of the relevant history does not support the majority’s interpretation.</p>
<p id="fba68b12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum: Washington’s and Adams’ Attorneys General read the Constitution to restrict recess appointments to vacancies arising during the recess, and there is no evidence that any of the first four Presidents consciously departed from that reading. The contrary reading was first defended by an executive official in 1823, was vehemently rejected by the Senate in 1863, was vigorously resisted by legislation in place from 1863 until 1940, and is arguably inconsistent with <span title="328" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-328">p. 328</span>legislation in place from 1940 to the present. The Solicitor General has identified only about 100 appointments that have ever been made under the broader reading, and while it seems likely that a good deal more have been made in the last few decades, there is good reason to doubt that many were made before 1940 (since the appointees could not have been compensated). I can conceive of no sane constitutional theory under which this evidence of “historical practice” — which is actually evidence of a long-simmering inter-branch conflict — would require us to defer to the views of the Executive Branch.</p>

<p id="fba68b14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the majority needs to sustain its judgment is an ambiguous text and a clear historical practice. What it has is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical practice. The majority replaces the Constitution’s text with a new set of judge-made rules to govern recess appointments. Henceforth, the Senate can avoid triggering the President’s now-vast recess-appointment power by the odd contrivance of never adjourning for more than three days without holding a <i>pro forma</i> session at which it is understood that no business will be conducted. How this new regime will work in practice remains to be seen. Perhaps it will reduce the prevalence of recess appointments. But perhaps not: Members of the President’s party in Congress may be able to prevent the Senate from holding <i>pro forma</i> sessions with the necessary frequency, and if the House and Senate disagree, the President may be able to adjourn both “to such Time as he shall think proper.” U.S. Const., Art. II, §3. In any event, the limitation upon the President’s appointment power is there not for the benefit of the Senate, but for the protection of the people; it should not be dependent on Senate action for its existence.</p>
<p id="fba68b15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The real tragedy of today’s decision is not simply the abolition of the Constitution’s limits on the recess-appointment power and the substitution of a novel framework invented by this Court. It is the damage done to our separation-of-powers jurisprudence more generally. Sad, but true: The Court’s embrace of the adverse-possession theory of executive power (a characterization the majority resists but does not refute) will be cited in diverse contexts, including those presently unimagined, and will have the effect of aggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional bounds and undermining respect for the separation of powers.</p>

<p id="fba68b18-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no provision of the Constitution concerning the president’s authority to remove executive branch officials. The principle that has emerged from the cases is that, in general, the president may remove executive officials unless removal is limited by statute. Congress, by statute, may limit removal both if it is an office where independence from the president is desirable and if the law does not prohibit removal but, rather, limits removal to instances where good cause is shown.</p>
<p id="fba68b19-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No single case has clearly articulated this principle.

The perception was that Johnson’s sympathies were with the South and that he was obstructing reconstruction and the North’s claiming the benefits of its victory. Congress passed the Tenure in Office Act of 1867 to prevent him from removing key members of the cabinet.</p>
<p id="fba6b22e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secretary of War Edwin Stanton openly challenged the president’s authority, and Johnson fired Stanton, even though that violated the Tenure in Office Act. The House of Representatives voted articles of impeachment based almost entirely on this removal. The vote in the Senate, however, was one short of the two-thirds necessary for removal, and thus Johnson completed his term as president.</p>

<p id="fba6b231-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question whether under the Constitution the President has the exclusive power of removing executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p id="fba6b232-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Myers, appellant’s intestate, was on July 21, 1917, appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to be a postmaster of the first class at Portland, Or., for a term of four years. On January 20, 1920, Myers’ resignation was demanded. He refused the demand. On February 2, 1920, he was removed from office by order of the Postmaster General, acting by direction of the President. He protested to the department against his removal, and continued to do so until the end of his term. He pursued no other occupation and drew compensation for no other service during the interval. On April 21, 1921, he brought this suit in the Court of Claims for his salary from the date of his removal, which, as claimed by supplemental petition filed after July 21, 1921, the end of his term, amounted to $8,838.71.</p>
<p id="fba6b233-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question where the power of removal of executive officers appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate was vested, was presented early in the first session of the First Congress. There is no express provision respecting removals in the Constitution, except as section 4 of article 2, above quoted, provides for removal from office by impeachment. The subject was not discussed in the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p id="fba6b234-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to prevent the removal of an officer who has served under the President is different from the authority to consent to or reject his appointment<span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>. When a nomination is made, it may be presumed that the Senate is, or may become, as well advised as to the fitness of the nominee as the President, but in the nature of things the defects in ability or intelligence or loyalty in the administration of the laws of one who has served as an officer under the President are facts as to which the President, or his trusted subordinates, must be better informed than the Senate, and the power to remove him may therefore be regarded as confined for very sound and practical reasons, to the governmental authority which has administrative control. The power of removal is incident to the power of appointment, not to the power of advising and consenting to appointment, and when the grant of the executive power is enforced by the express mandate to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it emphasizes the necessity for including within the executive power as conferred the exclusive power of removal.</p>
<p id="fba6b235-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is reasonable to suppose also that had it been intended to give to Congress power to regulate or control removals in the manner suggested, it would have been included among the specifically enumerated legislative powers in Article 1, or in the specified limitations on the executive power in Article 2. The difference between the grant of legislative power under Article 1 to Congress which is limited to powers therein enumerated, and the more general grant of the executive power to the President under Article 2 is significant. The fact that the executive power is given in general terms strengthened by specific terms where emphasis is appropriate, and limited by direct expressions where limitation is needed, and that no express limit is placed on the power of removal by the executive is a convincing indication that none was intended.</p>

William E. Humphrey, the decedent, on December 10, 1931, was nominated by President Hoover to succeed himself as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, and was confirmed by the United States Senate. He was duly commissioned for a term of seven years, expiring September 25, 1938; and, after taking the required oath of office, entered upon his duties. On July 25, 1933, President Roosevelt addressed a letter to the commissioner asking for his resignation, on the ground “that the aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the Commission can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection,” but disclaiming any reflection upon the commissioner personally or upon his services. The commissioner replied, asking time to consult his friends. The commissioner declined to resign; and on October 7, 1933, the President wrote him: “Effective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.”</p>
<p id="fba6d949-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provisions of section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, stat[e] that “any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” The question first to be considered is whether, by the provisions of section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act already quoted, the President’s power is limited to removal for the specific causes enumerated therein.</p>

It is charged with the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law. Its duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative. Like the Interstate Commerce Commission, its members are called upon to exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts “appointed by law and informed by experience.”</p>
<p id="fba6d94b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative reports in both houses of Congress clearly reflect the view that a fixed term was necessary to the effective and fair administration of the law. The debates in both houses demonstrate that the prevailing view was that the Commission was not to be “subject to anybody in the government but . . . only to the people of the United States”; free from “political domination or control” or the “probability or possibility of such a thing”; to be “separate and apart from any existing department of the government — not subject to the orders of the President.”</p>
<p id="fba6d94c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the language of the act, the legislative reports, and the general purposes of the legislation as reflected by the debates, all combine to demonstrate the congressional intent to create a body of experts who shall gain experience by length of service; a body which shall be independent of executive authority, except in its selection, and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official or any department of the government. To the accomplishment of these purposes, it is clear that Congress was of opinion that length and certainty of tenure would vitally contribute. And to hold that, nevertheless, the members of the commission continue in office at the mere will of the President, might be to thwart, in large measure, the very ends which Congress sought to realize by definitely fixing the term of office.</p>
<p id="fba6d94d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To support its contention that the removal provision of section 1, as we have just construed it, is an unconstitutional interference with the executive power of the President, the government’s chief reliance is Myers v.

<p id="fba6d94e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The office of a postmaster is so essentially unlike the office now involved that the decision in the Myers Case cannot be accepted as controlling our decision here. A postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions. He is charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power. The actual decision in the Myers Case finds support in the theory that such an officer is merely one of the units in the executive department and, hence, inherently subject to the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief Executive, whose subordinate and aid he is. It goes no farther; much less does it include an officer who occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President.</p>
<p id="fba6d94f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Trade Commission is an administrative body created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the statute in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed, and to perform other specified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid. Such a body cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive. Its duties are performed without executive leave and, in the contemplation of the statute, must be free from executive control. In administering the provisions of the statute in respect of “unfair methods of competition,” that is to say, in filling in and administering the details embodied by that general standard, the commission acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi judicially. In making investigations and reports thereon for the information of Congress under section 6, in aid of the <span title="332" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-332">p. 332</span>legislative power, it acts as a legislative agency. Under section 7, which authorizes the commission to act as a master in chancery under rules prescribed by the court, it acts as an agency of the judiciary. To the extent that it exercises any executive function, as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense, it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi legislative or quasi judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government.</p>
<p id="fba6d950-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President in respect of officers of the character of those just named. The authority of Congress, in creating quasi legislative or quasi judicial agencies, to require them to act in discharge of their duties independently of executive control cannot well be doubted; and that authority includes, as an appropriate incident, power to fix the period during which they shall continue, and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime. For it is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter’s will.</p>

<p id="fba6d953-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a suit for back pay, based on petitioner’s alleged illegal removal as a member of the War Claims Commission. The facts are not in dispute. By the War Claims Act of 1948, Congress established that Commission with “jurisdiction to receive and adjudicate according to law,” claims for compensating internees, prisoners of war, and religious organizations, who suffered personal injury or property damage at the hands of the enemy in connection with World War II. The Commission was to be composed of three persons, at least two of whom were to be members of the bar, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commission was to wind up its affairs not later than three years after the expiration of the time for filing claims. This limit on the Commission’s life was the mode by which the tenure of the Commissioners was defined, and Congress made no provision for removal of a Commissioner.</p>
<p id="fba6d954-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having been duly nominated by President Truman, the petitioner was confirmed on June 2, 1950, and took office on June 8, following. On his refusal to heed a request for his resignation, he was, on December 10, 1953, removed by President Eisenhower.</p>
<p id="fba70065-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he most reliable factor for drawing an inference regarding the President’s power of removal in our case is the nature of the function that Congress vested in the War Claims Commission. What were the duties that Congress confided to this Commission? And can the inference fairly be drawn from the failure of Congress to provide for removal that these Commissioners were to remain in office at the will of the President? For such is the assertion of power on which petitioner’s removal must rest. The ground of President Eisenhower’s removal of petitioner was precisely the same as President Roosevelt’s removal of Humphrey. Both Presidents desired to have Commissioners, one on the Federal Trade Commission, the other on the War Claims Commission, “of my own selection.” They wanted these Commissioners to be their men. The terms of removal in the two cases are identical and express the assumption that the agencies of which the two Commissioners were members were subject in the discharge of their duties to the control of the Executive. An analysis of the Federal Trade <span title="333" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-333">p. 333</span>Commission Act left this Court in no doubt that such was not the conception of Congress in creating the Federal Trade Commission. The terms of the War Claims Act of 1948 leave no doubt that such was not the conception of Congress regarding the War Claims Commission.</p>
<p id="fba70066-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of this legislation emphatically underlines this fact. The Commission was established as an adjudicating body with all the paraphernalia by which legal claims are put to the test of proof, with finality of determination “not subject to review by any other official of the United States or by any court by mandamus or otherwise.” The claims were to be “adjudicated according to law,” that is, on the merits of each claim, supported by evidence and governing legal considerations, by a body that was “entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect,” Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, either the Executive or the Congress. If, as one must take for granted, the War Claims Act precluded the President from influencing the Commission in passing on a particular claim, a fortiori must it be inferred that Congress did not wish to have hang over the Commission the Damocles’ sword of removal by the President for no reason other than that he preferred to have on that Commission men of his own choosing.</p>
<p id="fba70067-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For such is this case. We have not a removal for cause involving the rectitude of a member of an adjudicatory body, nor even a suspensory removal until the Senate could act upon it by confirming the appointment of a new Commissioner or otherwise dealing with the matter. Judging the matter in all the nakedness in which it is presented, namely, the claim that the President could remove a member of an adjudicatory body like the War Claims Commission merely because he wanted his own appointees on such a Commission, we are compelled to conclude that no such power is given to the President directly by the Constitution, and none is impliedly conferred upon him by statute simply because Congress said nothing about it. The philosophy of <i>Humphrey’s Executor</i>, in its explicit language as well as its implications, precludes such a claim.</p>

<p id="fba7006a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented by these appeals is whether the assignment by Congress to the Comptroller General of the United States of certain functions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 violates the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>
<p id="fba7006b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 12, 1985, the President signed into law the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, popularly known as the “Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.” The purpose of the Act is to eliminate the federal budget deficit. To that end, the Act sets a “maximum deficit amount” for federal spending for each of fiscal years 1986 through 1991. The size of that maximum deficit amount progressively reduces to zero in fiscal year 1991. If in any fiscal year the federal budget deficit exceeds the maximum deficit amount by more than a specified sum, the Act requires across-the-board cuts in federal spending to reach the targeted deficit level, with half of the cuts made to defense programs and the other half made to nondefense programs. The Act exempts certain priority programs from these cuts.</p>
<p id="fba7006c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution does not contemplate an active role for Congress in the supervision of officers charged with the execution of the laws it enacts. We conclude that Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment. To permit the execution <span title="334" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-334">p. 334</span>of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control over the execution of the laws.</p>
<p id="fba7006d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To permit an officer controlled by Congress to execute the laws would be, in essence, to permit a congressional veto. Congress could simply remove, or threaten to remove, an officer for executing the laws in any fashion found to be unsatisfactory to Congress. This kind of congressional control over the execution of the laws, <i>Chadha</i> makes clear, is constitutionally impermissible.</p>
<p id="fba7006e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dangers of congressional usurpation of Executive Branch functions have long been recognized. “[T]he debates of the Constitutional Convention, and the Federalist Papers, are replete with expressions of fear that the Legislative Branch of the National Government will aggrandize itself at the expense of the other two branches.” Buckley v. Valeo (1976). Indeed, we also have observed only recently that “[t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its power, even to accomplish desirable objectives, must be resisted.” With these principles in mind, we turn to consideration of whether the Comptroller General is controlled by Congress.</p>
<p id="fba7006f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The critical factor lies in the provisions of the statute defining the Comptroller General’s office relating to removability. Although the Comptroller General is nominated by the President from a list of three individuals recommended by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate, and confirmed by the Senate, he is removable only at the initiative of Congress. He may be removed not only by impeachment but also by joint resolution of Congress “at any time” resting on any one of the following bases: “(i) permanent disability; (ii) inefficiency; (iii) neglect of duty; (iv) malfeasance; or (v) a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude.”</p>
<p id="fba70070-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that Congress has consistently viewed the Comptroller General as an officer of the Legislative Branch. Over the years, the Comptrollers General have also viewed themselves as part of the Legislative Branch. By placing the responsibility for execution of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act in the hands of an officer who is subject to removal only by itself, Congress in effect has retained control over the execution of the Act and has intruded into the executive function. The Constitution does not permit such intrusion.</p>

OLSON, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): The case involved the constitutionality of the provisions of the Ethics in Government Act, which provide for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate alleged wrongdoing by the president and other high-level executive officials. The portion of the opinion concerning the constitutionality of the act’s having appointment of the independent counsel done by federal court judges is presented above. This is the part of the opinion concerning the removal power.</p>
<p id="fba72783-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Rehnquist</span> delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>
<p id="fba72784-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to consider whether the Act is invalid under the constitutional principle of separation of powers. The first is whether the provision of the Act restricting the Attorney General’s power to remove the independent counsel to only those instances in which he can show “good cause,” taken by itself, impermissibly interferes with the President’s exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions.</p>
<p id="fba72785-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike both <i>Bowsher</i> and <i>Myers</i>, this case does not involve an attempt by Congress itself to gain a role in the removal of executive officials other than <span title="335" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-335">p. 335</span>its established powers of impeachment and conviction. The Act instead puts the removal power squarely in the hands of the Executive Branch; an independent counsel may be removed from office, “only by the personal action of the Attorney General, and only for good cause.” There is no requirement of congressional approval of the Attorney General’s removal decision, though the decision is subject to judicial review. In our view, the removal provisions of the Act make this case more analogous to Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (1935), and Wiener v. United States (1958), than to <i>Myers</i> or <i>Bowsher.</i></p>
<p id="fba72786-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend that <i>Humphrey’s Executor</i> and <i>Wiener</i> are distinguishable from this case because they did not involve officials who performed a “core executive function.” They argue that our decision in <i>Humphrey’s Executor</i> rests on a distinction between “purely executive” officials and officials who exercise “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” powers. In their view, when a “purely executive” official is involved, the governing precedent is <i>Myers</i>, not <i>Humphrey’s Executor.</i> And, under <i>Myers</i>, the President must have absolute discretion to discharge “purely” executive officials at will.</p>
<p id="fba72787-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We undoubtedly did rely on the terms “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” to distinguish the officials involved in <i>Humphrey’s Executor</i> and <i>Wiener</i> from those in <i>Myers</i>, but our present considered view is that the determination of whether the Constitution allows Congress to impose a “good cause”-type restriction on the President’s power to remove an official cannot be made to turn on whether or not that official is classified as “purely executive.” The analysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to define rigid categories of those officials who may or may not be removed at will by the President, but to ensure that Congress does not interfere with the President’s exercise of the “executive power” and his constitutionally appointed duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” under Article II. <i>Myers</i> was undoubtedly correct in its holding, and in its broader suggestion that there are some “purely executive” officials who must be removable by the President at will if he is to be able to accomplish his constitutional role.</p>
<p id="fba72788-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the other end of the spectrum from <i>Myers</i>, the characterization of the agencies in <i>Humphrey’s Executor</i> and <i>Wiener</i> as “quasi-legislative” or “quasi-judicial” in large part reflected our judgment that it was not essential to the President’s proper execution of his Article II powers that these agencies be headed up by individuals who were removable at will. We do not mean to suggest that an analysis of the functions served by the officials at issue is irrelevant. But the real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the functions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that light.</p>
<p id="fba74e99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering for the moment the “good cause” removal provision in isolation from the other parts of the Act at issue in this case, we cannot say that the imposition of a “good cause” standard for removal by itself unduly trammels on executive authority. Although the counsel exercises no small amount of discretion and judgment in deciding how to carry out his or her duties under the Act, we simply do not see how the President’s need to control the exercise of that discretion is so central to the functioning of the Executive Branch as to require as a matter of constitutional law that the counsel be terminable at will by the President.</p>
<p id="fba74e9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we think that the “good cause” removal provision at issue here impermissibly burdens the President’s power to control or supervise the independent <span title="336" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-336">p. 336</span>counsel, as an executive official, in the execution of his or her duties under the Act. This is not a case in which the power to remove an executive official has been completely stripped from the President, thus providing no means for the President to ensure the “faithful execution” of the laws. Rather, because the independent counsel may be terminated for “good cause,” the Executive, through the Attorney General, retains ample authority to assure that the counsel is competently performing his or her statutory responsibilities in a manner that comports with the provisions of the Act. Although we need not decide in this case exactly what is encompassed within the term “good cause” under the Act, the legislative history of the removal provision also makes clear that the Attorney General may remove an independent counsel for “misconduct.” We do not think that this limitation as it presently stands sufficiently deprives the President of control over the independent counsel to interfere impermissibly with his constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.</p>

The board is composed of five members, appointed to staggered five-year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

<p id="fba74e9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">May the President be restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United States?</p>
<p id="fba74e9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is contrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in the President. The President cannot “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than one level of good-cause protection, even if the President determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or discharging them improperly. That judgment is instead committed to another officer, who may or may not agree with the President’s determination, and whom the President cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees with him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”</p>
<p id="fba74ea0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have previously upheld limited restrictions on the President’s removal power. In those cases, however, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power. It was the President — or a subordinate he could remove at will — who decided whether the officer’s conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.</p>
<p id="fba74ea1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act before us does something quite different. It not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested instead in other tenured officers — the Commissioners — none of whom is subject to <span title="337" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-337">p. 337</span>the President’s direct control.

<p id="fba74ea2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of the President’s review. Now the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will. The President therefore cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Board’s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the Commission accountable for everything else that it does. The Commissioners are not responsible for the Board’s actions. They are only responsible for their own determination of whether the Act’s rigorous good-cause standard is met. And even if the President disagrees with their determination, he is powerless to intervene — unless that determination is so unreasonable as to constitute “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”</p>
<p id="fba74ea3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This novel structure does not merely add to the Board’s independence, but transforms it. Neither the President, nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full control over the Board. The President is stripped of the power our precedents have preserved, and his ability to execute the laws — by holding his subordinates accountable for their conduct — is impaired.</p>
<p id="fba775b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That arrangement is contrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board’s failings to those whom he <i>can</i> oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Board’s conduct. He is not the one who decides whether Board members are abusing their offices or neglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board member’s breach of faith. This violates the basic principle that the President “cannot delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that goes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.”</p>

<p id="fba775b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress and the President had good reason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision. First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. This Court has long recognized the appropriateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the personal independence of those who even only sometimes engage in adjudicatory functions.</p>
<p id="fba775b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves, technical professional experts. This Court has recognized that the “difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing reports require the application of “scientific accounting principles.” And this Court has recognized the constitutional legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independence upon the need for technical expertise. Here, the justification for insulating the “technical experts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to political influence is particularly strong. Congress deliberately sought to provide that kind of protection.</p>
<p id="fba775b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We should ask one further question. Even if the “for cause” provision before us does not itself significantly interfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize Congress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable, Congress might undercut the President’s central constitutional role? The answer to this question is that no such need has been shown. <span title="338" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-338">p. 338</span>Moreover, insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails. And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious than any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might bring about.</p>
<p id="fba775b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inherent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its rule may not apply to “the civil service.” But even if I assume that the majority categorically excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new rule, the exclusion would be insufficient. Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps thousands of high level government officials within the scope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally at risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bureaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute removable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies. Then it would be necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies (just below the top) who themselves are removable only “for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking officials. This list is a conservative estimate because it consists only of career appointees in the Senior Executive Service (SES). The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects is yet larger. [A]dministrative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.” My research reflects that the Federal Government relies on 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in over 25 agencies</p>
<p id="fba775ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view the Court’s decision is wrong — very wrong. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly broad. In light of the present imprecision, it must either narrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually alone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in place a broader rule of decision applicable to many other “inferior officers” as well. In doing the latter, it will undermine the President’s authority. And it will create an obstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper functioning of that workable Government that the Constitution seeks to create — in provisions this Court is sworn to uphold.</p>
<p id="fba775bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Together, these cases seem to establish that the president may fire any executive official. Congress, however, can limit removal by statute if it is an office for which independence from the president is desirable, the statute does not prohibit removal but limits it to where there is good cause, and the statute does not keep the president from firing executive branch officials where there is good cause.</p>
<p id="fba775bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately the question is whether these mechanisms for controlling administrative agencies — statutes, budget, informal committee controls, appointment, and removal — are sufficient. Some justices have suggested that it would be desirable to revive the nondelegation doctrine. Justice Scalia seemed to be arguing for this in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson, above. Additionally, in the early 1980s, Justice Rehnquist took a similar position. In Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607 (1980), the Court upheld provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act that authorized the secretary of labor to adopt standards that are “reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment” and to “set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.” Justice Rehnquist, in a dissenting opinion, argued that these provisions should <span title="339" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-339">p. 339</span>have been invalidated as an excessive delegation of legislative power. He wrote, “When fundamental policy decisions underlying important legislation about to be enacted are to be made, the buck stops with Congress and the President insofar as he exercises his constitutional role in the legislative process.” If the Court were to follow the views of Rehnquist and Scalia, the issue then would become how to distinguish permissible from impermissible delegations of power.</p>

<p id="fba79ccf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution says very little about foreign policy decision making. Article I, §8 grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, “[t]o declare War, grant letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water,” to raise and support armies, and to “define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations.” Article II says that the “President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.” Article II also provides that the president “shall have Power, by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.”</p>
<p id="fba79cd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These relatively few provisions raise many difficult and important issues. For example, what is the relationship between Congress’s power to declare war and the president’s authority as commander in chief? When may the president use troops, including in war situations, without a congressional declaration of war? Another illustration of the Constitution’s ambiguity is whether the president can use executive agreements instead of treaties in dealing with foreign countries. Is this an appropriate exercise of the power of the chief executive or is it an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate’s power?</p>
<p id="fba79cd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an area of constitutional law where reliance on the framers’ intent is particularly difficult. A world of instantaneous communications, missiles that can be sent across the world in minutes, and troops that can be sent anywhere within hours is vastly different from that which existed in 1787.</p>
<p id="fba79cd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This area of constitutional law is different in another way as well: the relative absence of judicial decisions. As described in Chapter 1, the Supreme Court frequently has declared that issues concerning foreign policy are nonjusticiable political questions — matters for the executive and legislature to resolve without judicial review. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996 (1979) (holding nonjusticiable a challenge to the president’s rescission of the U.S. treaty with Taiwan) (included in Chapter 1).</p>
<p id="fba79cd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section considers three issues. First, are foreign policy and domestic affairs different under the Constitution? Does the president have more inherent authority regarding foreign policy than as to domestic affairs? Second, what are the constitutional limits on agreements with foreign nations? In particular, may the president use executive agreements rather than treaties? Finally, how is decision-making authority over war powers allocated?</p><span title="340" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-340">p. 340</span>

<p id="fba79cd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do the same principles of separation of powers apply in foreign policy as in domestic affairs? Should the Constitution be interpreted as according the president more inherent powers as to foreign policy? The leading case supporting this view is United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. The issue in the case is the constitutionality of a congressional delegation of power to the president in the area of foreign policy. As you read the decision, it is important to remember that the Supreme Court was aggressively enforcing the nondelegation doctrine — the principle that Congress cannot delegate legislative power to executive agencies — at the time the case was decided.</p>

<p id="fba7c3ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to stop sales of arms to countries involved in the Chaco border dispute. President Roosevelt immediately issued an order prohibiting munitions sales to the warring nations in the Chaco border dispute.</p>
<p id="fba7c3ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 27, 1936, an indictment was returned in the court below, the first count of which charges that appellees, beginning with the 29th day of May, 1934, conspired to sell in the United States certain arms of war, namely, fifteen machine guns, to Bolivia, a country then engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco, in violation of the Joint Resolution of Congress approved May 28, 1934, and the provisions of a proclamation issued on the same day by the President of the United States pursuant to authority conferred by section 1 of the resolution.</p>
<p id="fba7c3ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether, if the Joint Resolution had related solely to internal affairs, it would be open to the challenge that it constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Executive, we find it unnecessary to determine. The whole aim of the resolution is to affect a situation entirely external to the United States, and falling within the category of foreign affairs. The determination which we are called to make, therefore, is whether the Joint Resolution, as applied to that situation, is vulnerable to attack under the rule that forbids a delegation of the lawmaking power. In other words, assuming (but not deciding) that the challenged delegation, if it were confined to internal affairs, would be invalid, may it nevertheless be sustained on the ground that its exclusive aim is to afford a remedy for a hurtful condition within foreign territory?</p>
<p id="fba7c3f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will contribute to the elucidation of the question if we first consider the differences between the powers of the federal government in respect of foreign or external affairs and those in respect of domestic or internal affairs. That there are differences between them, and that these differences are fundamental, may not be doubted.</p>
<p id="fba7c3f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two classes of powers are different, both in respect of their origin and their nature. The broad statement that the federal government can exercise no powers except those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and such implied powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the enumerated powers, is categorically true only in respect of our internal affairs. In that field, the primary purpose of the Constitution was to carve from the general mass of legislative powers then possessed by the states such portions as it was thought <span title="341" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-341">p. 341</span>desirable to vest in the federal government, leaving those not included in the enumeration still in the states. That this doctrine applies only to powers which the states had is self-evident. And since the states severally never possessed international powers, such powers could not have been carved from the mass of state powers but obviously were transmitted to the United States from some other source. During the Colonial period, those powers were possessed exclusively by and were entirely under the control of the Crown.</p>
<p id="fba7c3f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It results that the investment of the federal government with the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the Constitution, would have vested in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality.</p>
<p id="fba7c3f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only, as we have shown, is the federal power over external affairs in origin and essential character different from that over internal affairs, but participation in the exercise of the power is significantly limited. In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it. As Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representatives, “The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.”</p>
<p id="fba7c3f4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to bear in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations — a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution. It is quite apparent that if, in the maintenance of our international relations, embarrassment — perhaps serious embarrassment — is to be avoided and success for our aims achieved, congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry within the international field must often accord to the President a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved. Moreover, he, not Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the conditions which prevail in foreign countries, and especially is this true in time of war. He has his confidential sources of information. He has his agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials. Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful results.</p>

<p id="fba7c3f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Sutherland’s broad interpretation of presidential power in foreign affairs has been challenged by constitutional scholars. First, some contend that his view is inconsistent with a written Constitution that contains provisions concerning foreign policy. If Sutherland’s view were correct, there would have been no reason for the Constitution to enumerate any powers in the area of foreign <span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-342">p. 342</span>affairs; all powers would exist automatically as part of national sovereignty. The detailing of authority for conducting foreign policy rebuts the assumption that the president has complete control over foreign affairs simply by virtue of being chief executive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B81_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10B81_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">9</a></span></p>
<p id="fba7c3f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, many have criticized the historical account that is the foundation for Justice Sutherland’s opinion. Professor Charles Lofgren notes that the “history on which [<i>Curtiss-Wright</i>] rest[s] is ‘shockingly inaccurate’” and not based on either the text of the Constitution or the framers’ intent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B92_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10B92_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">10</a></span> In his view, the framers intended that the president, like all branches of the federal government, have limited powers, not the expansive inherent authority described in <i>Curtiss-Wright</i>.</p>
<p id="fba7eb0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the President has broad inherent power in foreign policy as indicated in <i>Curtiss-Wright</i>, does this mean that congressional actions to limit the president in this realm are unconstitutional? The issue arose during the 1980s in connection with an attempt by the Reagan administration to circumvent a federal law prohibiting aid to the contras in Nicaragua. The Boland Amendment to the appropriation bills barred any “agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities” from spending funds “to support military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BA5_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BA5_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">11</a></span></p>
<p id="fba7eb0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some high-level members of the Reagan administration intentionally violated the Boland Amendment by raising funds from third parties to fund the contras and by selling arms to Iran to fund the contras.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BAE_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BAE_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">12</a></span> Some have defended these actions on the ground that the Boland Amendment was an impermissible restriction on the president’s power to conduct foreign policy. For example, a Republican minority report to a House Committee report declared, “[The] Constitution gives the President some power to act on his own in foreign affairs. . . . Congress may not use its control over appropriations, including salaries, to prevent the executive or judiciary from fulfilling Constitutionally mandated obligations.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BBC_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10BBC_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">13</a></span></p>
<p id="fba7eb10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others, including the Democratic majority on the House Committee, argued that Congress controls the power of the purse and therefore should be able to control government spending. The Boland Amendment was a restriction on expenditures. Moreover, Article I gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce. Thus, supporters of the Boland Amendment contended that it was constitutional and the president has no authority to disobey a constitutional statute in the conduct of foreign or domestic affairs.</p>

<p id="fba7eb11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Boland Amendment thus poses an example concerning the scope of the President’s powers in foreign policy and the ability of Congress to impose limits. Another, more recent example of this involves the only time in history that the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional a federal law regulating presidential conduct in the realm of foreign policy. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, the Court considered the constitutionality of a federal law that allowed American citizens <span title="343" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-343">p. 343</span>who had a child born in Jerusalem to have the child’s passport say “Jerusalem, Israel” as the place of birth.

<p id="fba81228-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A delicate subject lies in the background of this case. That subject is Jerusalem. Questions touching upon the history of the ancient city and its present legal and international status are among the most difficult and complex in international affairs. In our constitutional system these matters are committed to the Legislature and the Executive, not the Judiciary. As a result, in this opinion the Court does no more, and must do no more, than note the existence of international debate and tensions respecting Jerusalem. Those matters are for Congress and the President to discuss and consider as they seek to shape the Nation’s foreign policies.</p>
<p id="fba81229-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court addresses two questions to resolve the interbranch dispute now before it. First, it must determine whether the President has the exclusive power to grant formal recognition to a foreign sovereign. Second, if he has that power, the Court must determine whether Congress can command the President and his Secretary of State to issue a formal statement that contradicts the earlier recognition. The statement in question here is a congressional mandate that allows a United States citizen born in Jerusalem to direct the President and Secretary of State, when issuing his passport, to state that his place of birth is “Israel.”</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fba8122b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jerusalem’s political standing has long been, and remains, one of the most sensitive issues in American foreign policy, and indeed it is one of the most delicate issues in current international affairs. In 1948, President Truman formally recognized Israel in a signed statement of “recognition.” That statement did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. Over the last 60 years, various actors have sought to assert full or partial sovereignty over the city, including Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians. Yet, in contrast to a consistent policy of formal recognition of Israel, neither President Truman nor any later United States President has issued an official statement or declaration acknowledging any country’s sovereignty over Jerusalem. Instead, the Executive Branch has maintained that “‘the status of Jerusalem . . . should be decided not unilaterally but in consultation with all concerned.’”</p>
<p id="fba8122c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President’s position on Jerusalem is reflected in State Department policy regarding passports and consular reports of birth abroad. Understanding that passports will be construed as reflections of American policy, the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual instructs its employees, in general, to record the place of birth on a passport as the “country [having] present sovereignty over the actual area of birth.” Because the United States does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem, the FAM instructs employees to record the place of birth for citizens born there as “Jerusalem.”</p>
<p id="fba8122d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>In 2002, Congress passed the Act at issue here, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003. Section 214 of the Act is titled “United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.” The subsection that lies at the heart of this case, §214(d), addresses passports. That subsection seeks to override the FAM by allowing citizens born in Jerusalem to list their place of birth as “Israel.” Titled “Record of Place of Birth as Israel for Passport Purposes,” §214(d) states “[f]or purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.”</p>
<p id="fba8393e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2002, petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born to United States citizens living in Jerusalem. In December 2002, Zivotofsky’s mother visited the American Embassy in Tel Aviv to request both a passport and a consular report of birth abroad for her son. She asked that his place of birth be listed as “‘Jerusalem, Israel.’” The Embassy clerks explained that, pursuant to State Department policy, the passport would list only “Jerusalem.” Zivotofsky’s parents objected and, as his guardians, brought suit on his behalf in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking to enforce §214(d).</p>

<p id="fba83940-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering claims of Presidential power this Court refers to Justice Jackson’s familiar tripartite framework from Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952) (concurring opinion). The framework divides exercises of Presidential power into three categories: First, when “the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.” Second, “in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority” there is a “zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority,” and where “congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may” invite the exercise of executive power. Finally, when “the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress . . . he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.” To succeed in this third category, the President’s asserted power must be both “exclusive” and “conclusive” on the issue.</p>
<p id="fba83941-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the Secretary contends that §214(d) infringes on the President’s exclusive recognition power by “requiring the President to contradict his recognition position regarding Jerusalem in official communications with foreign sovereigns.” In so doing the Secretary acknowledges the President’s power is “at its lowest ebb.” Because the President’s refusal to implement §214(d) falls into Justice Jackson’s third category, his claim must be “scrutinized with caution,” and he may rely solely on powers the Constitution grants to him alone.</p>
<p id="fba83942-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To determine whether the President possesses the exclusive power of recognition the Court examines the Constitution’s text and structure, as well as precedent and history bearing on the question.</p><span title="345" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-345">p. 345</span>

<p id="fba83944-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognition is a “formal acknowledgement” that a particular “entity possesses the qualifications for statehood” or “that a particular regime is the effective government of a state.” It may also involve the determination of a state’s territorial bounds. Recognition is often effected by an express “written or oral declaration.” It may also be implied — for example, by concluding a bilateral treaty or by sending or receiving diplomatic agents.</p>
<p id="fba83945-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal consequences follow formal recognition. Recognized sovereigns may sue in United States courts, and may benefit from sovereign immunity when they are sued. The actions of a recognized sovereign committed within its own territory also receive deference in domestic courts under the act of state doctrine. Recognition at international law, furthermore, is a precondition of regular diplomatic relations. Recognition is thus “useful, even necessary,” to the existence of a state.</p>
<p id="fba83946-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the importance of the recognition power in foreign relations, the Constitution does not use the term “recognition,” either in Article II or elsewhere. The Secretary asserts that the President exercises the recognition power based on the Reception Clause, which directs that the President “shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.” Art. II, §3. As Zivotofsky notes, the Reception Clause received little attention at the Constitutional Convention. In fact, during the ratification debates, Alexander Hamilton claimed that the power to receive ambassadors was “more a matter of dignity than of authority,” a ministerial duty largely “without consequence.” The Federalist No. 69, p. 420 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>
<p id="fba83947-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of the founding, however, prominent international scholars suggested that receiving an ambassador was tantamount to recognizing the sovereignty of the sending state. It is a logical and proper inference, then, that a Clause directing the President alone to receive ambassadors would be understood to acknowledge his power to recognize other nations.</p>
<p id="fba83948-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result, the Reception Clause provides support, although not the sole authority, for the President’s power to recognize other nations.</p>
<p id="fba83949-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inference that the President exercises the recognition power is further supported by his additional Article II powers. It is for the President, “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,” to “make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2. In addition, “he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors” as well as “other public Ministers and Consuls.”</p>
<p id="fba8394a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of constitutional structure, these additional powers give the President control over recognition decisions. At international law, recognition may be effected by different means, but each means is dependent upon Presidential power. In addition to receiving an ambassador, recognition may occur on “the conclusion of a bilateral treaty,” or the “formal initiation of diplomatic relations,” including the dispatch of an ambassador. The President has the sole power to negotiate treaties, and the Senate may not conclude or ratify a treaty without Presidential action. The President, too, nominates the Nation’s ambassadors and dispatches other diplomatic agents. Congress may not send an ambassador without his involvement. Beyond that, the President himself has the power to open diplomatic channels simply by engaging in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers. The Constitution thus assigns the President means to effect recognition on his own initiative. Congress, by contrast, has no constitutional power that would enable it to initiate diplomatic relations with a foreign nation.</p>
<p id="fba8394b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The text and structure of the Constitution grant the President the power to recognize foreign nations and governments. The question then becomes <span title="346" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-346">p. 346</span>whether that power is exclusive. The various ways in which the President may unilaterally effect recognition — and the lack of any similar power vested in Congress — suggest that it is. So, too, do functional considerations. Put simply, the Nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not. Foreign countries need to know, before entering into diplomatic relations or commerce with the United States, whether their ambassadors will be received; whether their officials will be immune from suit in federal court; and whether they may initiate lawsuits here to vindicate their rights. These assurances cannot be equivocal.</p>
<p id="fba8605c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognition is a topic on which the Nation must “‘speak . . . with one voice.’” That voice must be the President’s. Between the two political branches, only the Executive has the characteristic of unity at all times. And with unity comes the ability to exercise, to a greater degree, “[d]ecision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch.” The Federalist No. 70, p. 424 (A. Hamilton). The President is capable, in ways Congress is not, of engaging in the delicate and often secret diplomatic contacts that may lead to a decision on recognition. These qualities explain why the Framers listed the traditional avenues of recognition — receiving ambassadors, making treaties, and sending ambassadors — as among the President’s Article II powers.</p>

<p id="fba8605e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No single precedent resolves the question whether the President has exclusive recognition authority and, if so, how far that power extends. In part that is because, until today, the political branches have resolved their disputes over questions of recognition. The relevant cases, though providing important instruction, address the division of recognition power between the Federal Government and the States, or between the courts and the political branches, not between the President and Congress. As the parties acknowledge, some isolated statements in those cases lend support to the position that Congress has a role in the recognition process. In the end, however, a fair reading of the cases shows that the President’s role in the recognition process is both central and exclusive.</p>
<p id="fba8605f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having examined the Constitution’s text and this Court’s precedent, it is appropriate to turn to accepted understandings and practice. In separation-of-powers cases this Court has often “put significant weight upon historical practice.” Here, history is not all on one side, but on balance it provides strong support for the conclusion that the recognition power is the President’s alone. From the first Administration forward, the President has claimed unilateral authority to recognize foreign sovereigns. For the most part, Congress has acquiesced in the Executive’s exercise of the recognition power.</p>

<p id="fba86061-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the power to recognize foreign states resides in the President alone, the question becomes whether §214(d) infringes on the Executive’s consistent decision to withhold recognition with respect to Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="fba86062-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 214(d) requires that, in a passport or consular report of birth abroad, “the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel” for a “United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem.” That is, §214(d) requires the President, through the <span title="347" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-347">p. 347</span>Secretary, to identify citizens born in Jerusalem who so request as being born in Israel. But according to the President, those citizens were not born in Israel. As a matter of United States policy, neither Israel nor any other country is acknowledged as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. In this way, §214(d) “directly contradicts” the “carefully calibrated and longstanding Executive branch policy of neutrality toward Jerusalem.”</p>
<p id="fba86063-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the power over recognition is to mean anything, it must mean that the President not only makes the initial, formal recognition determination but also that he may maintain that determination in his and his agent’s statements. This conclusion is a matter of both common sense and necessity. If Congress could command the President to state a recognition position inconsistent with his own, Congress could override the President’s recognition determination. Under international law, recognition may be effected by “written or oral declaration of the recognizing state.” In addition an act of recognition must “leave no doubt as to the intention to grant it.” Thus, if Congress could alter the President’s statements on matters of recognition or force him to contradict them, Congress in effect would exercise the recognition power.</p>
<p id="fba86064-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Justice Jackson wrote in <i>Youngstown,</i> when a Presidential power is “exclusive,” it “disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject.” Here, the subject is quite narrow: The Executive’s exclusive power extends no further than his formal recognition determination. But as to that determination, Congress may not enact a law that directly contradicts it. This is not to say Congress may not express its disagreement with the President in myriad ways. For example, it may enact an embargo, decline to confirm an ambassador, or even declare war. But none of these acts would alter the President’s recognition decision.</p>
<p id="fba86065-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Congress may not pass a law, speaking in its own voice, that effects formal recognition, then it follows that it may not force the President himself to contradict his earlier statement. That congressional command would not only prevent the Nation from speaking with one voice but also prevent the Executive itself from doing so in conducting foreign relations.</p>
<p id="fba86066-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the statement required by §214(d) would not itself constitute a formal act of recognition, it is a mandate that the Executive contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State. As a result, it is unconstitutional. This is all the more clear in light of the longstanding treatment of a passport’s place-of-birth section as an official executive statement implicating recognition.</p>
<p id="fba86067-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the face of §214, from the legislative history, and from its reception, it is clear that Congress wanted to express its displeasure with the President’s policy by, among other things, commanding the Executive to contradict his own, earlier stated position on Jerusalem. This Congress may not do.</p>
<p id="fba86068-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, as Zivotofsky notes, that Congress has substantial authority over passports. The Court does not question the power of Congress to enact passport legislation of wide scope. In holding §214(d) invalid the Court does not question the substantial powers of Congress over foreign affairs in general or passports in particular. This case is confined solely to the exclusive power of the President to control recognition determinations, including formal statements by the Executive Branch acknowledging the legitimacy of a state or government and its territorial bounds. Congress cannot command the President to contradict an earlier recognition determination in the issuance of passports.</p><span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>

<p id="fba8877a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s decision is a first: Never before has this Court accepted a President’s direct defiance of an Act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs. We have instead stressed that the President’s power reaches “its lowest ebb” when he contravenes the express will of Congress, “for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.” Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>
<p id="fba8877b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the President claims the exclusive and preclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns. The Court devotes much of its analysis to accepting the Executive’s contention. I have serious doubts about that position. The majority places great weight on the Reception Clause, which directs that the Executive “shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.” But that provision, framed as an obligation rather than an authorization, appears alongside the <i>duties</i> imposed on the President by Article II, Section 3, not the <i>powers</i> granted to him by Article II, Section 2. Indeed, the People ratified the Constitution with Alexander Hamilton’s assurance that executive reception of ambassadors “is more a matter of dignity than of authority” and “will be without consequence in the administration of the government.” In short, at the time of the founding, “there was no reason to view the reception clause as a source of discretionary authority for the president.” Adler, The President’s Recognition Power: Ministerial or Discretionary?</p>
<p id="fba8877c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s other asserted textual bases are even more tenuous. The President does have power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. Art. II, §2. But those authorities are <i>shared</i> with Congress, so they hardly support an inference that the recognition power is <i>exclusive</i>.</p>
<p id="fba8877d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Precedent and history lend no more weight to the Court’s position. The majority cites dicta suggesting an exclusive executive recognition power, but acknowledges contrary dicta suggesting that the power is shared. When the best you can muster is conflicting dicta, precedent can hardly be said to support your side.</p>
<p id="fba8877e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for history, the majority admits that it too points in both directions. Some Presidents have claimed an exclusive recognition power, but others have expressed uncertainty about whether such preclusive authority exists. Those in the skeptical camp include Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, leaders not generally known for their cramped conceptions of Presidential power. Congress has also asserted its authority over recognition determinations at numerous points in history. The majority therefore falls short of demonstrating that “Congress has accepted” the President’s exclusive recognition power. In any event, we have held that congressional acquiescence is only “pertinent” when the President acts in the absence of express congressional authorization, not when he asserts power to disregard a statute, as the Executive does here.</p>
<p id="fba8877f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, although the President has authority over recognition, I am not convinced that the Constitution provides the “conclusive and preclusive” power required to justify defiance of an express legislative mandate.</p>
<p id="fba88780-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even if the President does have exclusive recognition power, he still cannot prevail in this case, because the statute at issue <i>does not implicate recognition</i>. The relevant provision, §214(d), simply gives an American citizen born in Jerusalem the option to designate his place of birth as Israel “[f]or purposes of” passports and other documents. The State Department itself has explained that “identification” — not recognition — “is the principal reason that U.S. <span title="349" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-349">p. 349</span>passports require ‘place of birth.’” Congress has not disputed the Executive’s assurances that §214(d) does not alter the longstanding United States position on Jerusalem. And the annals of diplomatic history record no examples of official recognition accomplished via optional passport designation.</p>
<p id="fba88781-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority acknowledges both that the “Executive’s exclusive power extends no further than his formal recognition determination” and that §214(d) does “not itself constitute a formal act of recognition.” Taken together, these statements come close to a confession of error. The majority attempts to reconcile its position by reconceiving §214(d) as a “mandate that the Executive contradict his prior recognition determination in an official document issued by the Secretary of State.” But as just noted, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch regards §214(d) as a recognition determination, so it is hard to see how the statute could contradict any such determination.</p>
<p id="fba88782-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The expansive language in <i>Curtiss–Wright</i> casting the President as the “sole organ” of the Nation in foreign affairs certainly has attraction for members of the Executive Branch. The Solicitor General invokes the case no fewer than ten times in his brief. But our precedents have never accepted such a sweeping understanding of executive power.</p>
<p id="fba88783-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Resolving the status of Jerusalem may be vexing, but resolving this case is not. Whatever recognition power the President may have, exclusive or otherwise, is not implicated by §214(d). It has not been necessary over the past 225 years to definitively resolve a dispute between Congress and the President over the recognition power. Perhaps we could have waited another 225 years. But instead the majority strains to reach the question based on the mere possibility that observers overseas might misperceive the significance of the birthplace designation at issue in this case. And in the process, the Court takes the perilous step — for the first time in our history — of allowing the President to defy an Act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs.</p>
<p id="fba88784-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">The Chief Justice</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Alito</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fba8ae95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case arises out of a dispute between the Executive and Legislative Branches about whether the United States should treat Jerusalem as a part of Israel. The Constitution contemplates that the political branches will make policy about the territorial claims of foreign nations the same way they make policy about other international matters: The President will exercise his powers on the basis of his views, Congress its powers on the basis of its views. That is just what has happened here.</p>
<p id="fba8ae96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before turning to Presidential power under Article II, I think it well to establish the statute’s basis in congressional power under Article I. Congress’s power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, enables it to grant American citizenship to someone born abroad. The naturalization power also enables Congress to furnish the people it makes citizens with papers verifying their citizenship — say a consular report of birth abroad (which certifies citizenship of an American born outside the United States) or a passport (which certifies citizenship for purposes of international travel). As the Necessary and Proper Clause confirms, every congressional power “carries with it all those incidental powers which are necessary to its complete and effectual execution.” Even on a miserly understanding of Congress’s incidental authority, Congress <span title="350" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-350">p. 350</span>may make grants of citizenship “effectual” by providing for the issuance of certificates authenticating them.</p>
<p id="fba8ae97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One would think that if Congress may grant Zivotofsky a passport and a birth report, it may also require these papers to record his birthplace as “Israel.” The birthplace specification promotes the document’s citizenship-authenticating function by identifying the bearer, distinguishing people with similar names but different birthplaces from each other, helping authorities uncover identity fraud, and facilitating retrieval of the Government’s citizenship records. To be sure, recording Zivotofsky’s birthplace as “Jerusalem” rather than “Israel” would fulfill these objectives, but when faced with alternative ways to carry its powers into execution, Congress has the “discretion” to choose the one it deems “most beneficial to the people.” It thus has the right to decide that recording birthplaces as “Israel” makes for better foreign policy. Or that regardless of international politics, a passport or birth report should respect its bearer’s conscientious belief that Jerusalem belongs to Israel.</p>
<p id="fba8ae98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court frames this case as a debate about recognition. Recognition is a sovereign’s official acceptance of a status under international law. A sovereign might recognize a foreign entity as a state, a regime as the other state’s government, a place as part of the other state’s territory, rebel forces in the other state as a belligerent power, and so on.</p>
<p id="fba8ae99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court holds that the Constitution makes the President alone responsible for recognition and that §214(d) invades this exclusive power. I agree that the Constitution <i>empowers</i> the President to extend recognition on behalf of the United States, but I find it a much harder question whether it makes that power exclusive. The Court tells us that “the weight of historical evidence” supports exclusive executive authority over “the formal determination of recognition.” But even with its attention confined to formal recognition, the Court is forced to admit that “history is not all on one side.”</p>
<p id="fba8ae9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To know all this is to realize at once that §214(d) has nothing to do with recognition. Section 214(d) does not require the Secretary to make a formal declaration about Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem. And nobody suggests that international custom infers acceptance of sovereignty from the birthplace designation on a passport or birth report, as it does from bilateral treaties or exchanges of ambassadors. Recognition would preclude the United States (as a matter of international law) from later contesting Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. But making a notation in a passport or birth report does not encumber the Republic with any international obligations. It leaves the Nation free (so far as international law is concerned) to change its mind in the future. That would be true even if the statute required <i>all</i> passports to list “Israel.” But in fact it requires only those passports to list “Israel” for which the citizen (or his guardian) <i>requests</i> “Israel”; all the rest, under the Secretary’s policy, list “Jerusalem.” It is utterly impossible for this deference to private requests to constitute an act that unequivocally manifests an intention to grant recognition.</p>
<p id="fba8ae9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Constitution gives the President sole power to extend recognition, it does not give him sole power to make all decisions relating to foreign disputes over sovereignty. The Constitution likewise does not give the President exclusive power to determine which claims to statehood and territory “are legitimate in the eyes of the United States.” Congress may express its own views about these matters by declaring war, restricting trade, denying foreign aid, and much else besides.</p>
<p id="fba8ae9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="351" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-351">p. 351</span>In the final analysis, the Constitution may well deny Congress power to -recognize — the power to make an international commitment accepting a foreign entity as a state, a regime as its government, a place as a part of its territory, and so on. But whatever else §214(d) may do, it plainly does not make (or require the President to make) a commitment accepting Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="fba8ae9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Constitution they approved, Congress may require Zivotofsky’s passport and birth report to record his birthplace as Israel, even if that requirement clashes with the President’s preference for neutrality about the status of Jerusalem.</p>

<p id="fba8aea0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article II, §2 states that the president “shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.” The major constitutional issue that has arisen concerns the authority of the president to use executive agreements rather than treaties for foreign policy commitments. A treaty is an agreement between the United States and a foreign country that is negotiated by the president and is effective when ratified by the Senate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D1E_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10D1E_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">14</a></span> An executive agreement, in contrast, is an agreement between the United States and a foreign country that is effective when signed by the president and the head of the other government. In other words, if the document is labeled “treaty,” Senate approval is required. If the document is titled “executive agreement,” no Senate ratification is necessary.</p>
<p id="fba8d5b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Constitution does not mention executive agreements, it is well established that such agreements are constitutional. Indeed, based on past experience, it appears that executive agreements can be used for any purpose; that is, anything that can be done by treaty can be done by executive agreement. Never in American history has the Supreme Court declared an executive agreement unconstitutional as usurping the Senate’s treaty-approving function. Even major foreign policy commitments have been implemented through executive agreements. For example, in 1940, the “Destroyer-Bases Agreement” substantially expanded American involvement in World War II when President Roosevelt agreed to loan Great Britain 50 naval destroyers in exchange for the United States receiving free 99-year leases to develop military bases on several sites in the Caribbean and Newfoundland.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D34_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10D34_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">15</a></span></p>

<p id="fba8d5b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court upheld the executive agreement and explained that because it was not a treaty, Senate approval was not required. New York courts had refused to enforce the Litvinov Agreement, but the Court ruled that states must comply with executive agreements. Executive agreements, like treaties, prevail over state law and policy. Justice Douglas, writing for the Court in <i>Pink</i>, explained, “A treaty is a ‘Law of the Land’ under the supremacy clause [of Article VI] of the Constitution. Such international compacts and agreements as the Litvinov Assignment have a similar dignity.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D5D_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10D5D_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">19</a></span> Similarly, in United States v.

<p id="fba8fcd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The questions presented by this case touch fundamentally upon the manner in which our Republic is to be governed. Throughout the nearly two centuries of our Nation’s existence under the Constitution, this subject has generated considerable debate. We have had the benefit of commentators such as John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison writing in The Federalist Papers at the Nation’s very inception, the benefit of astute foreign observers of our system such as Alexis de Tocqueville and James Bryce writing during the first century of the Nation’s existence, and the benefit of many other treatises as well as more than 400 volumes of reports of decisions of this Court. As these writings reveal it is doubtless both futile and perhaps dangerous to find any epigrammatical explanation of how this country has been governed. Indeed, as Justice Jackson noted, “[a] judge . . . may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually present themselves.”</p>

<p id="fba8fcd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 4, 1979, the American Embassy in Tehran was seized and our diplomatic personnel were captured and held hostage. In response to that crisis, President Carter, acting pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (hereinafter IEEPA) declared a national emergency on November 14, 1979, and blocked the removal or transfer of “all property and interests in <span title="353" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-353">p. 353</span>property of the Government of Iran, its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran which are or become subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. . . .” Exec. Order No. 12170.</p>
<p id="fba8fcd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 20, 1981, the Americans held hostage were released by Iran pursuant to an Agreement entered into the day before and embodied in two Declarations of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria. The Agreement stated that “[i]t is the purpose of [the United States and Iran] . . . to terminate all litigation as between the Government of each party and the nationals of the other, and to bring about the settlement and termination of all such claims through binding arbitration.” In furtherance of this goal, the Agreement called for the establishment of an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal which would arbitrate any claims not settled within six months. Awards of the Claims Tribunal are to be “final and binding” and “enforceable . . . in the courts of any nation in accordance with its laws.” Under the Agreement, the United States is obligated “to terminate all legal proceedings in United States courts involving claims of United States persons and institutions against Iran and its state enterprises, to nullify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, to prohibit all further litigation based on such claims, and to bring about the termination of such claims through binding arbitration.”</p>
<p id="fba8fcd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 28, 1981, petitioner filed this action in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief against the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury, seeking to prevent enforcement of the Executive Orders and Treasury Department regulations implementing the Agreement with Iran. In its complaint, petitioner alleged that the actions of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury implementing the Agreement with Iran were beyond their statutory and constitutional powers and, in any event, were unconstitutional to the extent they adversely affect petitioner’s final judgment against the Government of Iran and the Atomic Energy Organization, its execution of that judgment in the State of Washington, its prejudgment attachments, and its ability to continue to litigate against the Iranian banks.</p>
<p id="fba8fcd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not infrequently in affairs between nations, outstanding claims by nationals of one country against the government of another country are “sources of friction” between the two sovereigns. United States v. Pink (1942). To resolve these difficulties, nations have often entered into agreements settling the claims of their respective nationals. As one treatise writer puts it, international agreements settling claims by nationals of one state against the government of another “are established international practice reflecting traditional international theory.” L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the Constitution 262 (1972). Consistent with that principle, the United States has repeatedly exercised its sovereign authority to settle the claims of its nationals against foreign countries. Though those settlements have sometimes been made by treaty, there has also been a longstanding practice of settling such claims by executive agreement without the advice and consent of the Senate. Under such agreements, the President has agreed to renounce or extinguish claims of United States nationals against foreign governments in return for lump-sum payments or the establishment of arbitration procedures. It is clear that the practice of settling claims continues today. Since 1952, the President has entered into at least 10 binding settlements with foreign nations, including an $80 million settlement with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p id="fba8fcd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crucial to our decision today is the conclusion that Congress has implicitly approved the practice of claim settlement by executive agreement. This <span title="354" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-354">p. 354</span>is best demonstrated by Congress’ enactment of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. The Act had two purposes: (1) to allocate to United States nationals funds received in the course of an executive claims settlement with Yugoslavia, and (2) to provide a procedure whereby funds resulting from future settlements could be distributed. To achieve these ends Congress created the International Claims Commission, now the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and gave it jurisdiction to make final and binding decisions with respect to claims by United States nationals against settlement funds. By creating a procedure to implement future settlement agreements, Congress placed its stamp of approval on such agreements. Indeed, the legislative history of the Act observed that the United States was seeking settlements with countries other than Yugoslavia and that the bill contemplated settlements of a similar nature in the future.</p>
<p id="fba8fcd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years Congress has frequently amended the International Claims Settlement Act to provide for particular problems arising out of settlement agreements, thus demonstrating Congress’ continuing acceptance of the President’s claim settlement authority. In addition to congressional acquiescence in the President’s power to settle claims, prior cases of this Court have also recognized that the President does have some measure of power to enter into executive agreements without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate. In United States v. Pink (1942), for example, the Court upheld the validity of the Litvinov Assignment, which was part of an Executive Agreement whereby the Soviet Union assigned to the United States amounts owed to it by American nationals so that outstanding claims of other American nationals could be paid.</p>
<p id="fba922ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we re-emphasize the narrowness of our decision. We do not decide that the President possesses plenary power to settle claims, even as against foreign governmental entities. But where, as here, the settlement of claims has been determined to be a necessary incident to the resolution of a major foreign policy dispute between our country and another, and where, as here, we can conclude that Congress acquiesced in the President’s action, we are not prepared to say that the President lacks the power to settle such claims.</p>
<p id="fba922eb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 1940s and 1950s, Senator Bricker proposed a constitutional amendment, known as the Bricker Amendment, that would have prevented the use of executive agreements. The Amendment never was passed by Congress, but it reflects deep concern over the President’s ability to circumvent the treaty ratification process by using executive agreements instead.</p>

<p id="fba922ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution is an invitation for a struggle between the president and Congress over control of the war power. The Constitution, in Article I, grants Congress the power to declare war and the authority to raise and support the army and the navy. Article II makes the president the commander in chief.</p>
<p id="fba922ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Basic, unresolved questions exist concerning these powers. First, what constitutes a declaration of war? Must it be a formal declaration of war, such as was adopted by Congress after the bombing of Pearl Harbor to authorize America’s entry into World War II? Or may it be less explicit? For example, was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized the use of military force in Southeast Asia, sufficient to constitute a declaration of war for the Vietnam War? Might even <span title="355" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-355">p. 355</span>repeated congressional approval of funding for a war be regarded as sufficient even without passage of a resolution explicitly approving the war?</p>
<p id="fba922f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, when may the president use American troops in hostilities without congressional approval? To what extent does the president’s power as commander in chief authorize the use of troops in foreign countries without a formal declaration of war? Neither of these questions ever has been clearly answered by the Supreme Court. In fact, given the Court’s view that such foreign policy disputes constitute a political question, answers are unlikely to come from the judiciary.</p>
<p id="fba922f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the Supreme Court rarely has spoken as to the constitutionality of the president using troops in a war or warlike circumstances without congressional approval. In fact, the only Supreme Court case to address the issue was in the unique context of the Civil War and the actions of the president to deal with the rebellion. In the <i>Prize Cases</i>, the Court ruled that the president had the power to impose a blockade on Southern states without a congressional declaration of war.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DDE_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10DDE_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">21</a></span> No other Supreme Court case has addressed the constitutionality of presidential war making without a congressional declaration of war. Therefore, little exists in the way of law regarding the circumstances in which the president may use troops without congressional approval or as to what Congress may do to suspend American involvement in a war.</p>
<p id="fba922f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1973, Congress adopted the War Powers Resolution to address these two questions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DE8_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10DE8_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">22</a></span> The War Powers Resolution was a response to the Vietnam War in which two presidents, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, fought a highly unpopular war with great cost in lives and dollars without a formal declaration of war from Congress.</p>

<p id="fba9bf5f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution has not been tested. In 1999, Representative Tom Campbell brought a lawsuit arguing that the bombing of Yugoslavia was in violation of the War Powers Resolution. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the case for lack of standing and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. Campbell v. Clinton, 52 F. Supp. 2d 34 (D.D.C. 1999), <i>aff’d</i>, 203 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 2000). In 2003, a lawsuit was brought to have the impending war in Iraq declared unconstitutional. It, too, was dismissed as nonjusticiable. Doe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133 (1st Cir. 2003).

<p id="fba9bf63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tragic events of September 11, 2001, have led to many government actions that will raise important difficult constitutional questions: Is the indefinite detention of “unlawful combatants” constitutional? Are secret deportation proceedings constitutional? Is it permissible for the government to hold individuals indefinitely as “material witnesses”? Are provisions of the USA Patriot Act, which include expanded authorization for electronic eavesdropping by the government, constitutional?</p>
<p id="fba9bf64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The materials below consider two issues: When may the executive detain U.S. enemy combatants, and when, if at all, are military tribunals constitutional?</p>

<p id="fba9bf67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2004, the Supreme Court decided three major cases concerning civil liberties and the war on terrorism. Two were resolved largely on nonconstitutional grounds. In Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), the Supreme Court held that detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had a right to have their <span title="359" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-359">p. 359</span>habeas corpus petition heard in a federal court. In Padilla v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 426 (2004), the Court held that an American citizen, apprehended in the United States and held as an enemy combatant in a military prison in South Carolina, could not present a habeas corpus petition in federal court in New York, where he was earlier held. Rather, the habeas petition needed to be refiled in South Carolina.</p>
<p id="fba9bf68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, below, the Court considered whether an American citizen apprehended in a foreign country could be indefinitely detained as an enemy combatant without any form of due process. By a five-to-four margin, though without a majority opinion, the Court ruled that there was sufficient legal authority to detain Hamdi as an enemy combatant. But the Court, by an eight-to-one margin, concluded that Hamdi must be accorded due process, including a meaningful factual hearing. In October 2004, Hamdi was released from custody after agreeing to renounce his U.S. citizenship, not take up arms against the United States, and not to return to this country.</p>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioner’s detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label. We now vacate and remand. We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.</p>

<p id="fba9e681-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States. Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks. One week later, in response to these “acts of treacherous violence,” Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks” or “harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.” Soon thereafter, the President ordered United States Armed Forces to Afghanistan, with a mission to subdue al Qaeda and quell the Taliban regime that was known to support it.</p>
<p id="fba9e682-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case arises out of the detention of a man whom the Government alleges took up arms with the Taliban during this conflict. His name is Yaser Esam <span title="360" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-360">p. 360</span>Hamdi. Born an American citizen in Louisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi Arabia as a child. By 2001, the parties agree, he resided in Afghanistan. At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military. The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002. In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina. The Government contends that Hamdi is an “enemy combatant,” and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitely — without formal charges or proceedings — unless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.</p>

<p id="fba9e684-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as “enemy combatants.” There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such. It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the “enemy combatant” that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was “‘part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners’” in Afghanistan and who “‘engaged in an armed conflict against the United States’” there. We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution. We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Government’s alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdi’s detention.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d96-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdi’s principal argument for the illegality of his detention. He posits that his detention is forbidden by 18 U.S.C. §4001(a). Section 4001(a) states that “[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.” Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage. Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government again presses two alternative positions. First, it argues that §4001(a) applies only to “the control of civilian prisons and related detentions,” not to military detentions. Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained “pursuant to an Act of Congress” — the [Authorization for Use of Military Force]. Again, because we conclude that the Government’s second assertion is correct, we do not address the first. In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional <span title="361" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-361">p. 361</span>authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)’s requirement that a detention be “pursuant to an Act of Congress” (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).</p>
<p id="fbaa0d98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The AUMF authorizes the President to use “all necessary and appropriate force” against “nations, organizations, or persons” associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF. We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the “necessary and appropriate force” Congress has authorized the President to use.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The capture and detention of lawful combatants and the capture, detention, and trial of unlawful combatants, by “universal agreement and practice,” are “important incident[s] of war.” <i>Ex parte Quirin.</i> The purpose of detention is to prevent captured individuals from returning to the field of battle and taking up arms once again. [I]t is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention. Because detention to prevent a combatant’s return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of “necessary and appropriate force,” Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention. Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized. Further, we understand Congress’s grant of authority for the use of “necessary and appropriate force” to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles. If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel. But that is not the situation we face as of this date. Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan. The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who “engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.” If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of “necessary and appropriate force,” and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.</p>
<p id="fbaa0d9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ex parte Milligan</i> (1866) does not undermine our holding about the Government’s authority to seize enemy combatants, as we define that term today. In that case, the Court made repeated reference to the fact that its inquiry into whether the military tribunal had jurisdiction to try and punish Milligan turned in large part on the fact that Milligan was not a prisoner of war, but a resident of Indiana arrested while at home there. That fact was central to its conclusion. Had Milligan been captured while he was assisting Confederate soldiers by carrying a rifle against Union troops on a Confederate battlefield, the holding of the Court might well have been different. The Court’s repeated explanations that Milligan was not a prisoner of war suggest that had these <span title="362" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-362">p. 362</span>different circumstances been present he could have been detained under military authority for the duration of the conflict, whether or not he was a citizen.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F57_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N10F57_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">23</a></span></p>

<p id="fbaa0d9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status. Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that “extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay” does not comport with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Government counters that any more process than was provided below would be both unworkable and “constitutionally intolerable.” Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination both of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the Due Process Clause, which informs the procedural contours of that mechanism in this instance.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbaa0d9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">A</p></div>
<p id="fbaa34b0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though they reach radically different conclusions on the process that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground. All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States. Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ. All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here. Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention.</p>
<p id="fbaa34b1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuit’s holding below — that because it is “undisputed” that Hamdi’s seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary. This argument is easily rejected. As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdi’s seizure cannot in any way be characterized as “undisputed,” as “those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.” Further, the “facts” that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdi’s detention. Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress’s authorization, Hamdi would need to be “part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners” and “engaged in an armed conflict against the United States” to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict. The habeas petition states only that “[w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.” An assertion that one <i>resided</i> in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was <span title="363" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-363">p. 363</span>“<i>captured</i> in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war,” and certainly is not a concession that one was “part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners” and “engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.” Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.</p>
<p id="fbaa34b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s second argument requires closer consideration. This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake. Under the Government’s most extreme rendition of this argument, “[r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict” ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme. At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential “some evidence” standard. Under this review, a court would assume the accuracy of the Government’s articulated basis for Hamdi’s detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Declaration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a legitimate one.</p>
<p id="fbaa34b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his detention may not be held at the will of the Executive without recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executive’s asserted justifications for that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law.</p>
<p id="fbaa34b4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns. And both emphasize the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right. The ordinary mechanism that we use for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” is the test that we articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge (1976). <i>Mathews</i> dictates that the process due in any given instance is determined by weighing “the private interest that will be affected by the official action” against the Government’s asserted interest, “including the function involved” and the burdens the Government would face in providing greater process. The <i>Mathews</i> calculus then contemplates a judicious balancing of these concerns, through an analysis of “the risk of an erroneous deprivation” of the private interest if the process were reduced and the “probable value, if any, of additional or substitute safeguards.” We take each of these steps in turn.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="fbaa34b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a">1</p></div>
<p id="fbaa34b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is beyond question that substantial interests lie on both sides of the scale in this case. Hamdi’s “private interest . . . affected by the official action,” is the most elemental of liberty interests — the interest in being free from physical detention by one’s own government. Nor is the weight on this side of the <i>Mathews</i> scale offset by the circumstances of war or the accusation of treasonous behavior, for “[i]t is clear that commitment for <i>any</i> purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection,” and at this stage in the <i>Mathews</i> calculus, we consider the interest of the <i>erroneously</i> detained individual. Indeed, as <i>amicus</i> briefs from media and relief organizations emphasize, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a citizen’s liberty in the absence of <span title="364" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-364">p. 364</span>sufficient process here is very real. Moreover, as critical as the Government’s interest may be in detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the national security of the United States during ongoing international conflict, history and common sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do not present that sort of threat. We reaffirm today the fundamental nature of a citizen’s right to be free from involuntary confinement by his own government without due process of law, and we weigh the opposing governmental interests against the curtailment of liberty that such confinement entails.</p>

<p id="fbaa34b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the scale are the weighty and sensitive governmental interests in ensuring that those who have in fact fought with the enemy during a war do not return to battle against the United States. As discussed above, the law of war and the realities of combat may render such detentions both necessary and appropriate, and our due process analysis need not blink at those realities. Without doubt, our Constitution recognizes that core strategic matters of warmaking belong in the hands of those who are best positioned and most politically accountable for making them.</p>
<p id="fbaa34b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government also argues at some length that its interests in reducing the process available to alleged enemy combatants are heightened by the practical difficulties that would accompany a system of trial-like process. In its view, military officers who are engaged in the serious work of waging battle would be unnecessarily and dangerously distracted by litigation half a world away, and discovery into military operations would both intrude on the sensitive secrets of national defense and result in a futile search for evidence buried under the rubble of war. To the extent that these burdens are triggered by heightened procedures, they are properly taken into account in our due process analysis.</p>

<p id="fbaa5bcb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Striking the proper constitutional balance here is of great importance to the Nation during this period of ongoing combat. But it is equally vital that our calculus not give short shrift to the values that this country holds dear or to the privilege that is American citizenship. It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation’s commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.</p>
<p id="fbaa5bcc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that a citizen-detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an enemy combatant must receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government’s factual assertions before a neutral decision maker. These essential constitutional promises may not be eroded.</p>
<p id="fbaa5bcd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy-combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict. Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding. Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Government’s evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided. Thus, once the <span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-365">p. 365</span>Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria. A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant. In the words of <i>Mathews</i>, process of this sort would sufficiently address the “risk of erroneous deprivation” of a detainee’s liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures that have questionable additional value in light of the burden on the Government.</p>
<p id="fbaa5bce-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts. The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to <i>continue</i> to hold those who have been seized.</p>

<p id="fbaa5bd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In so holding, we necessarily reject the Government’s assertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances. Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to <i>condense</i> power into a single branch of government. We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens. Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake. Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge. Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.</p>
<p id="fbaa5bd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed “some evidence” standard is inadequate. Any process in which the Executive’s factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.</p>

Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent. The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government <span title="366" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-366">p. 366</span>claims.

<p id="fbaa5bd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: “No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.” Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Government’s stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act “pursuant” to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals? With one possible though important qualification, the answer has to be no. For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.</p>
<p id="fbaa82e6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation. The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage. That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in Korematsu v. United States (1944). The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell. Congress’s understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.</p>
<p id="fbaa82e7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized. The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each. In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security. For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nation’s entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises. A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that “the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other — that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.” The Federalist No. 51. Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.</p>
<p id="fbaa82e8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="367" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-367">p. 367</span>Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here. I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Government’s mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war. It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well. Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jackson’s observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952) (concurring opinion) (presidential authority is “at its lowest ebb” where the President acts contrary to congressional will).</p>
<p id="fbaa82e9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jackson’s statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority). This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.</p>
<p id="fbaa82ea-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons’ insistence, confined executive power by “the law of the land.”</p>

<p id="fbaa82ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I find Hamdi’s detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself. For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="fbaa82ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Government’s position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose. Although I think litigation of Hamdi’s status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the plurality’s remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.</p>

His father claims to the contrary, that he is an inexperienced aid worker caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. This case brings into conflict the competing demands of national security and our <span title="368" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-368">p. 368</span>citizens’ constitutional right to personal liberty. Although I share the Court’s evident unease as it seeks to reconcile the two, I do not agree with its resolution.</p>
<p id="fbaa82f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the Government accuses a citizen of waging war against it, our constitutional tradition has been to prosecute him in federal court for treason or some other crime. Where the exigencies of war prevent that, the Constitution’s Suspension Clause, Art. I, §9, cl. 2, allows Congress to relax the usual protections temporarily. Absent suspension, however, the Executive’s assertion of military exigency has not been thought sufficient to permit detention without charge. No one contends that the congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force, on which the Government relies to justify its actions here, is an implementation of the Suspension Clause. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision below.</p>
<p id="fbaa82f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive. The allegations here, of course, are no ordinary accusations of criminal activity. Yaser Esam Hamdi has been imprisoned because the Government believes he participated in the waging of war against the United States. The relevant question, then, is whether there is a different, special procedure for imprisonment of a citizen accused of wrongdoing <i>by aiding the enemy in wartime.</i></p>
<p id="fbaa82f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor, writing for a plurality of this Court, asserts that captured enemy combatants (other than those suspected of war crimes) have traditionally been detained until the cessation of hostilities and then released. That is probably an accurate description of wartime practice with respect to enemy <i>aliens.</i> The tradition with respect to American citizens, however, has been quite different. Citizens aiding the enemy have been treated as traitors subject to the criminal process.</p>
<p id="fbaa82f3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are times when military exigency renders resort to the traditional criminal process impracticable. English law accommodated such exigencies by allowing legislative suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for brief periods. Our Federal Constitution contains a provision explicitly permitting suspension, but limiting the situations in which it may be invoked: “The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The Suspension Clause was by design a safety valve, the Constitution’s only “express provision for exercise of extraordinary authority because of a crisis.”</p>
<p id="fbaaaa04-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several limitations give my views in this matter a relatively narrow compass. They apply only to citizens, accused of being enemy combatants, who are detained within the territorial jurisdiction of a federal court. This is not likely to be a numerous group; currently we know of only two, Hamdi and Jose Padilla. Where the citizen is captured outside and held outside the United States, the constitutional requirements may be different. Moreover, even within the United States, the accused citizen-enemy combatant may lawfully be detained once prosecution is in progress or in contemplation. The Government has been notably successful in securing conviction, and hence long-term custody or execution, of those who have waged war against the state.</p>
<p id="fbaaaa05-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I frankly do not know whether these tools are sufficient to meet the Government’s security needs, including the need to obtain intelligence through interrogation. It is far beyond my competence, or the Court’s competence, to determine that. But it is not beyond Congress’s. If the situation demands it, the Executive can ask Congress to authorize suspension of the writ — which can be made subject to whatever conditions Congress deems appropriate, including <span title="369" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-369">p. 369</span>even the procedural novelties invented by the plurality today. To be sure, suspension is limited by the Constitution to cases of rebellion or invasion. But whether the attacks of September 11, 2001, constitute an “invasion,” and whether those attacks still justify suspension several years later, are questions for Congress rather than this Court. If civil rights are to be curtailed during wartime, it must be done openly and democratically, as the Constitution requires, rather than by silent erosion through an opinion of this Court.</p>

<p id="fbaaaa07-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Executive Branch, acting pursuant to the powers vested in the President by the Constitution and with explicit congressional approval, has determined that Yaser Hamdi is an enemy combatant and should be detained. This detention falls squarely within the Federal Government’s war powers, and we lack the expertise and capacity to second-guess that decision. As such, petitioner’s habeas challenge should fail, and there is no reason to remand the case. The plurality reaches a contrary conclusion by failing adequately to consider basic principles of the constitutional structure as it relates to national security and foreign affairs and by using the balancing scheme of Mathews v. Eldridge (1976). I do not think that the Federal Government’s war powers can be balanced away by this Court. Arguably, Congress could provide for additional procedural protections, but until it does, we have no right to insist upon them. But even if I were to agree with the general approach the plurality takes, I could not accept the particulars. The plurality utterly fails to account for the Government’s compelling interests and for our own institutional inability to weigh competing concerns correctly. I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p id="fbaaaa08-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the President very well may have inherent authority to detain those arrayed against our troops, I agree with the plurality that we need not decide that question because Congress has authorized the President to do so. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) authorizes the President to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks” of September 11, 2001. But I do not think that the plurality has adequately explained the breadth of the President’s authority to detain enemy combatants, an authority that includes making virtually conclusive factual findings. In my view, the structural considerations discussed above, as recognized in our precedent, demonstrate that we lack the capacity and responsibility to second-guess this determination.</p>
<p id="fbaaaa09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s asserted authority to detain an individual that the President has determined to be an enemy combatant, at least while hostilities continue, comports with the Due Process Clause. As these cases also show, the Executive’s decision that a detention is necessary to protect the public need not and should not be subjected to judicial second-guessing. Indeed, at least in the context of enemy-combatant determinations, this would defeat the unity, secrecy, and dispatch that the Founders believed to be so important to the warmaking function.</p>
<p id="fbaaaa0a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, I conclude that the Government’s detention of Hamdi as an enemy combatant does not violate the Constitution. By detaining Hamdi, the President, in the prosecution of a war and authorized by Congress, has acted well within his authority. Hamdi thereby received all the process to which he was due under the circumstances. I therefore believe that this is no occasion to balance the competing interests, as the plurality unconvincingly attempts to do.</p>

Rumsfeld (2004), five Members of the Court recognized that detention of individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan “for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the ‘necessary and appropriate force’ Congress has authorized the President to use.” After <i>Hamdi</i>, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine whether individuals detained at Guantanamo were “enemy combatants,” as the Department defines that term. A later memorandum established procedures to implement the CSRTs. The Government maintains these procedures were designed to comply with the due process requirements identified by the plurality in <i>Hamdi</i>.</p>
<p id="fbaad129-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interpreting the AUMF, the Department of Defense ordered the detention of these petitioners, and they were transferred to Guantanamo. Some of these individuals were apprehended on the battlefield in Afghanistan, others in places as far away from there as Bosnia and Gambia. All are foreign nationals, but none is a citizen of a nation now at war with the United States. Each denies he is a member of the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks or of the Taliban regime that provided sanctuary for al Qaeda. Each petitioner appeared before a separate CSRT; was determined to be an enemy combatant; and has sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p id="fbaad12a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first actions commenced in February 2002. We granted certiorari and reversed, holding that 28 U.S.C. §2241 extended statutory habeas corpus jurisdiction to Guantanamo. See Rasul v. Bush (2004). After <i>Rasul</i>, petitioners’ cases were consolidated and entertained in two separate proceedings. In the first set of cases, Judge Richard J. Leon granted the Government’s motion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that could be vindicated in a habeas corpus action. In the second set of cases Judge Joyce Hens Green reached the opposite conclusion, holding the detainees had rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>

<p id="fbaaf845-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deciding the constitutional questions now presented we must determine whether petitioners are barred from seeking the writ or invoking the protections of the Suspension Clause either because of their status, i.e., petitioners’ designation by the Executive Branch as enemy combatants, or their physical location, i.e., their presence at Guantanamo Bay. The Government contends that non- citizens designated as enemy combatants and detained in territory located outside our Nation’s borders have no constitutional rights and no privilege of habeas corpus. Petitioners contend they do have cognizable constitutional rights and that Congress, in seeking to eliminate recourse to habeas corpus as a means to assert those rights, acted in violation of the Suspension Clause.</p>
<p id="fbaaf846-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom. Experience taught, however, that the common-law writ all too often had been insufficient to guard against the abuse of monarchial power. That history counseled the necessity for specific language in the Constitution to secure the writ and ensure its place in our legal system.</p>
<p id="fbaaf847-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, <span title="373" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-373">p. 373</span>unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” Art. I, §9, cl. 2. The word “privilege” was used, perhaps, to avoid mentioning some rights to the exclusion of others. (Indeed, the only mention of the term “right” in the Constitution, as ratified, is in its clause giving Congress the power to protect the rights of authors and inventors. See Art. I, §8, cl. 8.) Surviving accounts of the ratification debates provide additional evidence that the Framers deemed the writ to be an essential mechanism in the separation-of-powers scheme.</p>
<p id="fbaaf848-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our own system the Suspension Clause is designed to protect against these cyclical abuses. The Clause protects the rights of the detained by a means consistent with the essential design of the Constitution. It ensures that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the “delicate balance of governance” that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty. The Clause protects the rights of the detained by affirming the duty and authority of the Judiciary to call the jailer to account.</p>

<p id="fbaaf84a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Drawing from its position that at common law the writ ran only to territories over which the Crown was sovereign, the Government says the Suspension Clause affords petitioners no rights because the United States does not claim sovereignty over the place of detention.</p>
<p id="fbaaf84b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Guantanamo Bay is not formally part of the United States. And under the terms of the lease between the United States and Cuba, Cuba retains “ultimate sovereignty” over the territory while the United States exercises “complete jurisdiction and control.” Under the terms of the 1934 Treaty, however, Cuba effectively has no rights as a sovereign until the parties agree to modification of the 1903 Lease Agreement or the United States abandons the base.</p>
<p id="fbaaf84c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States contends, nevertheless, that Guantanamo is not within its sovereign control. This was the Government’s position well before the events of September 11, 2001. And in other contexts the Court has held that questions of sovereignty are for the political branches to decide. Even if this were a treaty interpretation case that did not involve a political question, the President’s construction of the lease agreement would be entitled to great respect.</p>
<p id="fbaaf84d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore do not question the Government’s position that Cuba, not the United States, maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense of the term, over Guantanamo Bay. But this does not end the analysis. Our cases do not hold it is improper for us to inquire into the objective degree of control the Nation asserts over foreign territory. Accordingly, for purposes of our analysis, we accept the Government’s position that Cuba, and not the United States, retains de jure sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay. As we did in <i>Rasul</i>, however, we take notice of the obvious and uncontested fact that the United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control over the base, maintains de facto sovereignty over this territory.</p>
<p id="fbaaf84e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were we to hold that the present cases turn on the political question doctrine, we would be required first to accept the Government’s premise that de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas corpus jurisdiction. This premise, however, is unfounded. For the reasons indicated above, the history of common-law <span title="374" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-374">p. 374</span>habeas corpus provides scant support for this proposition; and, for the reasons indicated below, that position would be inconsistent with our precedents and contrary to fundamental separation-of-powers principles.</p>

<p id="fbab1f60-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has discussed the issue of the Constitution’s extraterritorial application on many occasions. These decisions undermine the Government’s argument that, at least as applied to noncitizens, the Constitution necessarily stops where de jure sovereignty ends.</p>
<p id="fbab1f61-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Practical considerations weighed heavily as well in Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950), where the Court addressed whether habeas corpus jurisdiction extended to enemy aliens who had been convicted of violating the laws of war. The prisoners were detained at Landsberg Prison in Germany during the Allied Powers’ postwar occupation. The Court stressed the difficulties of ordering the Government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding. It “would require allocation of shipping space, guarding personnel, billeting and rations” and would damage the prestige of military commanders at a sensitive time.</p>
<p id="fbab1f62-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, the Court in <i>Eisentrager</i> denied access to the writ, and it noted the prisoners “at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and [that] the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.” The Government seizes upon this language as proof positive that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court adopted a formalistic, sovereignty-based test for determining the reach of the Suspension Clause. We reject this reading for three reasons.</p>
<p id="fbab1f63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we do not accept the idea that the above-quoted passage from <i>Eisentrager</i> is the only authoritative language in the opinion and that all the rest is dicta. The Court’s further determinations, based on practical considerations, were integral to Part II of its opinion and came before the decision announced its holding.</p>
<p id="fbab1f64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, because the United States lacked both de jure sovereignty and plenary control over Landsberg Prison, it is far from clear that the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court used the term sovereignty only in the narrow technical sense and not to connote the degree of control the military asserted over the facility. The Justices who decided <i>Eisentrager</i> would have understood sovereignty as a multifaceted concept. That the Court devoted a significant portion of Part II to a discussion of practical barriers to the running of the writ suggests that the Court was not concerned exclusively with the formal legal status of Landsberg Prison but also with the objective degree of control the United States asserted over it. Even if we assume the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court considered the United States’ lack of formal legal sovereignty over Landsberg Prison as the decisive factor in that case, its holding is not inconsistent with a functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. The formal legal status of a given territory affects, at least to some extent, the political branches’ control over that territory. De jure sovereignty is a factor that bears upon which constitutional guarantees apply there.</p>
<p id="fbab1f65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, if the Government’s reading of <i>Eisentrager</i> were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases’ functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality. We cannot accept the Government’s view. Nothing in <i>Eisentrager</i> says that de jure sovereignty is or has ever been the only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the Constitution or of habeas corpus.</p>

<p id="fbab1f67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s formal sovereignty-based test raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns as well. The political history of Guantanamo illustrates the deficiencies of this approach. The United States has maintained complete and uninterrupted control of the bay for over 100 years. Yet the Government’s view is that the Constitution had no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed sovereignty in the formal sense of the term. The necessary implication of the argument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over any unincorporated territory to a third party, while at the same time entering into a lease that grants total control over the territory back to the United States, it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint.</p>
<p id="fbab1f68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. Even when the United States acts outside its borders, its powers are not “absolute and unlimited” but are subject “to such restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution.” Abstaining from questions involving formal sovereignty and territorial governance is one thing. To hold the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will is quite another. The former position reflects this Court’s recognition that certain matters requiring political judgments are best left to the political branches. The latter would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say “what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison (1803).</p>
<p id="fbab1f69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspension Clause question in the cases now before us, for the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers. The test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.</p>

<p id="fbab467b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the practical concerns discussed above, the <i>Eisentrager</i> Court found relevant that each petitioner:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbab467c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.</p>
</div>
<p id="fbab467d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on this language from <i>Eisentrager</i>, and the reasoning in our other extraterritoriality opinions, we conclude that at least three factors are relevant in determining the reach of the Suspension Clause: (1) the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoner’s entitlement to the writ.</p>
<p id="fbab467e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying this framework, we note at the onset that the status of these detainees is a matter of dispute. The petitioners, like those in <i>Eisentrager</i>, are not American citizens. But the petitioners in <i>Eisentrager</i> did not contest, it seems, the Court’s assertion that they were “enemy alien[s].” In the instant cases, by contrast, the detainees deny they are enemy combatants. They have been afforded some process in CSRT proceedings to determine their status; but, unlike in <span title="376" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-376">p. 376</span><i>Eisentrager</i>, there has been no trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war. The difference is not trivial. The records from the <i>Eisentrager</i> trials suggest that, well before the petitioners brought their case to this Court, there had been a rigorous adversarial process to test the legality of their detention. The <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners were charged by a bill of particulars that made detailed factual allegations against them. To rebut the accusations, they were entitled to representation by counsel, allowed to introduce evidence on their own behalf, and permitted to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>
<p id="fbab467f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In comparison the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the CSRT hearings are far more limited, and, we conclude, fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review. Although the detainee is assigned a “Personal Representative” to assist him during CSRT proceedings, the Secretary of the Navy’s memorandum makes clear that person is not the detainee’s lawyer or even his “advocate.” The Government’s evidence is accorded a presumption of validity. The detainee is allowed to present “reasonably available” evidence, but his ability to rebut the Government’s evidence against him is limited by the circumstances of his confinement and his lack of counsel at this stage. And although the detainee can seek review of his status determination in the Court of Appeals, that review process cannot cure all defects in the earlier proceedings.</p>
<p id="fbab4680-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the second factor relevant to this analysis, the detainees here are similarly situated to the <i>Eisentrager</i> petitioners in that the sites of their apprehension and detention are technically outside the sovereign territory of the United States. As noted earlier, this is a factor that weighs against finding they have rights under the Suspension Clause. But there are critical differences between Landsberg Prison, circa 1950, and the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay in 2008. Unlike its present control over the naval station, the United States’ control over the prison in Germany was neither absolute nor indefinite. Like all parts of occupied Germany, the prison was under the jurisdiction of the combined Allied Forces. Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, is no transient possession. In every practical sense Guantanamo is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p id="fbab4681-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the third factor, we recognize, as the Court did in <i>Eisentrager</i>, that there are costs to holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention abroad. Habeas corpus proceedings may require expenditure of funds by the Government and may divert the attention of military personnel from other pressing tasks. While we are sensitive to these concerns, we do not find them dispositive. Compliance with any judicial process requires some incremental expenditure of resources. Yet civilian courts and the Armed Forces have functioned along side each other at various points in our history. The Government presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees’ claims. And in light of the plenary control the United States asserts over the base, none are apparent to us.</p>
<p id="fbab4682-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation in <i>Eisentrager</i> was far different, given the historical context and nature of the military’s mission in post-War Germany. When hostilities in the European Theater came to an end, the United States became responsible for an occupation zone encompassing over 57,000 square miles with a population of 18 million. In addition to supervising massive reconstruction and aid efforts the American forces stationed in Germany faced potential security threats from <span title="377" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-377">p. 377</span>a defeated enemy. In retrospect the post-War occupation may seem uneventful. But at the time <i>Eisentrager</i> was decided, the Court was right to be concerned about judicial interference with the military’s efforts to contain “enemy elements, guerilla fighters, and ‘were-wolves.’”</p>
<p id="fbab4683-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar threats are not apparent here; nor does the Government argue that they are. The United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay consists of 45 square miles of land and water. The base has been used, at various points, to house migrants and refugees temporarily. At present, however, other than the detainees themselves, the only long-term residents are American military personnel, their families, and a small number of workers. The detainees have been deemed enemies of the United States. At present, dangerous as they may be if released, they are contained in a secure prison facility located on an isolated and heavily fortified military base.</p>
<p id="fbab6d94-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no indication, furthermore, that adjudicating a habeas corpus petition would cause friction with the host government. No Cuban court has jurisdiction over American military personnel at Guantanamo or the enemy combatants detained there. While obligated to abide by the terms of the lease, the United States is, for all practical purposes, answerable to no other sovereign for its acts on the base. Were that not the case, or if the detention facility were located in an active theater of war, arguments that issuing the writ would be “impracticable or anomalous” would have more weight. Under the facts presented here, however, there are few practical barriers to the running of the writ. To the extent barriers arise, habeas corpus procedures likely can be modified to address them.</p>
<p id="fbab6d95-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that Art. I, §9, cl. 2, of the Constitution has full effect at Guantanamo Bay. If the privilege of habeas corpus is to be denied to the detainees now before us, Congress must act in accordance with the requirements of the Suspension Clause.</p>

<p id="fbab6d97-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this holding the question becomes whether the statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids the Suspension Clause mandate because Congress has provided adequate substitute procedures for habeas corpus.</p>
<p id="fbab6d98-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The gravity of the separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact that these detainees have been denied meaningful access to a judicial forum for a period of years render these cases exceptional.</p>
<p id="fbab6d99-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. We do consider it uncontroversial, however, that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to “the erroneous application or interpretation” of relevant law. And the habeas court must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained — though release need not be the exclusive remedy and is not the appropriate one in every case in which the writ is granted.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a person is detained by executive order, rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need for collateral review is most pressing. Habeas corpus proceedings need not resemble a criminal trial, even when the detention is by executive order. But the writ must be effective. The habeas court <span title="378" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-378">p. 378</span>must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executive’s power to detain.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To determine the necessary scope of habeas corpus review, therefore, we must assess the CSRT process, the mechanism through which petitioners’ designation as enemy combatants became final. Whether one characterizes the CSRT process as direct review of the Executive’s battlefield determination that the detainee is an enemy combatant — as the parties have and as we do — or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference in a proper analysis of whether the procedures Congress put in place are an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. What matters is the sum total of procedural protections afforded to the detainee at all stages, direct and collateral.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs. The most relevant for our purposes are the constraints upon the detainee’s ability to rebut the factual basis for the Government’s assertion that he is an enemy combatant. As already noted, at the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Government’s case against him. He does not have the assistance of counsel and may not be aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied upon to order his detention. The detainee can confront witnesses that testify during the CSRT proceedings. But given that there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence — the only requirement is that the tribunal deem the evidence “relevant and helpful,” — the detainee’s opportunity to question witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were to assume that the CSRTs satisfy due process standards, it would not end our inquiry. Habeas corpus is a collateral process that exists, in Justice Holmes’ words, to “cu[t] through all forms and g[o] to the very tissue of the structure. It comes in from the outside, not in subordination to the proceedings, and although every form may have been preserved opens the inquiry whether they have been more than an empty shell.” Even when the procedures authorizing detention are structurally sound, the Suspension Clause remains applicable and the writ relevant.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we make no judgment as to whether the CSRTs, as currently constituted, satisfy due process standards, we agree with petitioners that, even when all the parties involved in this process act with diligence and in good faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal’s findings of fact. And given that the consequence of error may be detention of persons for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, this is a risk too significant to ignore.</p>
<p id="fbab6d9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to function as an effective and proper remedy in this context, the court that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors that occurred during the CSRT proceedings. This includes some authority to assess the sufficiency of the Government’s evidence against the detainee. It also must have the authority to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding. Federal habeas petitioners long have had the means to supplement the record on review, even in the postconviction habeas setting. Here that opportunity is constitutionally required.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="fbab6da1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now consider whether the DTA allows the Court of Appeals to conduct a proceeding meeting these standards. The DTA does not explicitly empower the <span title="379" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-379">p. 379</span>Court of Appeals to order the applicant in a DTA review proceeding released should the court find that the standards and procedures used at his CSRT hearing were insufficient to justify detention. This is troubling. Yet, for present purposes, we can assume congressional silence permits a constitutionally required remedy. The absence of a release remedy and specific language allowing AUMF challenges are not the only constitutional infirmities from which the statute potentially suffers, however. The more difficult question is whether the DTA permits the Court of Appeals to make requisite findings of fact. Assuming the DTA can be construed to allow the Court of Appeals to review or correct the CSRT’s factual determinations, as opposed to merely certifying that the tribunal applied the correct standard of proof, we see no way to construe the statute to allow what is also constitutionally required in this context: an opportunity for the detainee to present relevant exculpatory evidence that was not made part of the record in the earlier proceedings.</p>
<p id="fbab94b2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face the statute allows the Court of Appeals to consider no evidence outside the CSRT record. By foreclosing consideration of evidence not presented or reasonably available to the detainee at the CSRT proceedings, the DTA disadvantages the detainee by limiting the scope of collateral review to a record that may not be accurate or complete.</p>
<p id="fbab94b3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we do not hold that an adequate substitute must duplicate §2241 in all respects, it suffices that the Government has not established that the detainees’ access to the statutory review provisions at issue is an adequate substitute for the writ of habeas corpus. MCA §7 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. In view of our holding we need not discuss the reach of the writ with respect to claims of unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement.</p>

<p id="fbab94b5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The real risks, the real threats, of terrorist attacks are constant and not likely soon to abate. The ways to disrupt our life and laws are so many and unforeseen that the Court should not attempt even some general catalogue of crises that might occur. Certain principles are apparent, however. Practical considerations and exigent circumstances inform the definition and reach of the law’s writs, including habeas corpus. The cases and our tradition reflect this precept.</p>
<p id="fbab94b6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In cases involving foreign citizens detained abroad by the Executive, it likely would be both an impractical and unprecedented extension of judicial power to assume that habeas corpus would be available at the moment the prisoner is taken into custody. If and when habeas corpus jurisdiction applies, as it does in these cases, then proper deference can be accorded to reasonable procedures for screening and initial detention under lawful and proper conditions of confinement and treatment for a reasonable period of time. Domestic exigencies, furthermore, might also impose such onerous burdens on the Government that here, too, the Judicial Branch would be required to devise sensible rules for staying habeas corpus proceedings until the Government can comply with its requirements in a responsible way. Here, as is true with detainees apprehended abroad, a relevant consideration in determining the courts’ role is whether there are suitable alternative processes in place to protect against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power.</p>
<p id="fbab94b7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="380" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-380">p. 380</span>The cases before us, however, do not involve detainees who have been held for a short period of time while awaiting their CSRT determinations. Were that the case, or were it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger. These qualifications no longer pertain here. In some of these cases six years have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute demands. And there has been no showing that the Executive faces such onerous burdens that it cannot respond to habeas corpus actions. To require these detainees to complete DTA review before proceeding with their habeas corpus actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay. The detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing.</p>
<p id="fbab94b8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision today holds only that the petitioners before us are entitled to seek the writ; that the DTA review procedures are an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus; and that the petitioners in these cases need not exhaust the review procedures in the Court of Appeals before proceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court. The only law we identify as unconstitutional is MCA §7. Accordingly, both the DTA and the CSRT process remain intact. Our holding with regard to exhaustion should not be read to imply that a habeas court should intervene the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs. The Executive is entitled to a reasonable period of time to determine a detainee’s status before a court entertains that detainee’s habeas corpus petition.</p>
<p id="fbab94b9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, proper deference must be accorded to the political branches. There are further considerations, however. Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom’s first principles. Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers. It is from these principles that the judicial authority to consider petitions for habeas corpus relief derives.</p>
<p id="fbab94ba-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our opinion does not undermine the Executive’s powers as Commander in Chief. On the contrary, the exercise of those powers is vindicated, not eroded, when confirmed by the Judicial Branch. Within the Constitution’s separation- of-powers structure, few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person. Some of these petitioners have been in custody for six years with no definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention. Their access to the writ is a necessity to determine the lawfulness of their status, even if, in the end, they do not obtain the relief they seek.</p>
<p id="fbab94bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because our Nation’s past military conflicts have been of limited duration, it has been possible to leave the outer boundaries of war powers undefined. If, as some fear, terrorism continues to pose dangerous threats to us for years to come, the Court might not have this luxury. This result is not inevitable, however. The political branches, consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the Constitution, can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the Nation from terrorism.</p>
<p id="fbab94bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears repeating that our opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners’ detention. That is a matter yet to be determined. We hold that petitioners may invoke the fundamental procedural protections of <span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-381">p. 381</span>habeas corpus. The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law. The Framers decided that habeas corpus, a right of first importance, must be a part of that framework, a part of that law.</p>
<p id="fbab94bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Souter</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span> join, concurring.</p>
<p id="fbab94be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the Court’s opinion in its entirety and add this afterword only to emphasize two things one might overlook after reading the dissents.</p>
<p id="fbabbbcf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four years ago, this Court in Rasul v. Bush (2004) held that statutory habeas jurisdiction extended to claims of foreign nationals imprisoned by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, “to determine the legality of the Executive’s potentially indefinite detention” of them. Subsequent legislation eliminated the statutory habeas jurisdiction over these claims, so that now there must be constitutionally based jurisdiction or none at all. But no one who reads the Court’s opinion in <i>Rasul</i> could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases, given the Court’s reliance on the historical background of habeas generally in answering the statutory question.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents is the length of the disputed imprisonments, some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years. Hence the hollow ring when the dissenters suggest that the Court is somehow precipitating the judiciary into reviewing claims that the military (subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) could handle within some reasonable period of time. These suggestions of judicial haste are all the more out of place given the Court’s realistic acknowledgment that in periods of exigency the tempo of any habeas review must reflect the immediate peril facing the country. After six years of sustained executive detentions in Guantanamo, subject to habeas jurisdiction but without any actual habeas scrutiny, today’s decision is no judicial victory, but an act of perseverance in trying to make habeas review, and the obligation of the courts to provide it, mean something of value both to prisoners and to the Nation.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Roberts</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Scalia</span>, Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Thomas</span>, and Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Alito</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants. The political branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongoing military conflict, after much careful investigation and thorough debate. The Court rejects them today out of hand, without bothering to say what due process rights the detainees possess, without explaining how the statute fails to vindicate those rights, and before a single petitioner has even attempted to avail himself of the law’s operation. And to what effect? The majority merely replaces a review system designed by the people’s representatives with a set of shapeless procedures to be defined by federal courts at some future date. One cannot help but think, after surveying the modest practical results of the majority’s ambitious opinion, that this decision is not really about the detainees at all, but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="382" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-382">p. 382</span>The majority is adamant that the Guantanamo detainees are entitled to the protections of habeas corpus — its opinion begins by deciding that question. I regard the issue as a difficult one, primarily because of the unique and unusual jurisdictional status of Guantanamo Bay. I nonetheless agree with Justice Scalia’s analysis of our precedents and the pertinent history of the writ, and accordingly join his dissent. The important point for me, however, is that the Court should have resolved these cases on other grounds. Habeas is most fundamentally a procedural right, a mechanism for contesting the legality of executive detention. The critical threshold question in these cases, prior to any inquiry about the writ’s scope, is whether the system the political branches designed protects whatever rights the detainees may possess. If so, there is no need for any additional process, whether called “habeas” or something else.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress entrusted that threshold question in the first instance to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as the Constitution surely allows Congress to do. But before the D.C. Circuit has addressed the issue, the Court cashiers the statute, and without answering this critical threshold question itself. The Court does eventually get around to asking whether review under the DTA is, as the Court frames it, an “adequate substitute” for habeas, but even then its opinion fails to determine what rights the detainees possess and whether the DTA system satisfies them. The majority instead compares the undefined DTA process to an equally undefined habeas right — one that is to be given shape only in the future by district courts on a case-by-case basis. This whole approach is misguided.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also fruitless. How the detainees’ claims will be decided now that the DTA is gone is anybody’s guess. But the habeas process the Court mandates will most likely end up looking a lot like the DTA system it replaces, as the district court judges shaping it will have to reconcile review of the prisoners’ detention with the undoubted need to protect the American people from the terrorist threat — precisely the challenge Congress undertook in drafting the DTA. All that today’s opinion has done is shift responsibility for those sensitive foreign policy and national security decisions from the elected branches to the Federal Judiciary.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe the system the political branches constructed adequately protects any constitutional rights aliens captured abroad and detained as enemy combatants may enjoy. I therefore would dismiss these cases on that ground. With all respect for the contrary views of the majority, I must dissent.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s overreaching is particularly egregious given the weakness of its objections to the DTA. Simply put, the Court’s opinion fails on its own terms. The majority strikes down the statute because it is not an “adequate substitute” for habeas review, but fails to show what rights the detainees have that cannot be vindicated by the DTA system.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority is equally wrong to characterize the CSRTs as part of that initial determination process. They are instead a means for detainees to challenge the Government’s determination. The Executive designed the CSRTs to mirror Army Regulation 190-8, the very procedural model the plurality in <i>Hamdi</i> said provided the type of process an enemy combatant could expect from a habeas court. The CSRTs operate much as habeas courts would if hearing the detainee’s collateral challenge for the first time: They gather evidence, call witnesses, take testimony, and render a decision on the legality of the Government’s detention. If the CSRT finds a particular detainee has been improperly held, it can order release.</p>
<p id="fbabbbd9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="383" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-383">p. 383</span>The majority insists that even if “the CSRTs satisf[ied] due process standards,” full habeas review would still be necessary, because habeas is a collateral remedy available even to prisoners “detained pursuant to the most rigorous proceedings imaginable.” This comment makes sense only if the CSRTs are incorrectly viewed as a method used by the Executive for determining the prisoners’ status, and not as themselves part of the collateral review to test the validity of that determination. The majority can deprecate the importance of the CSRTs only by treating them as something they are not.</p>
<p id="fbabbbda-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the <i>Hamdi</i> plurality concluded that this type of review would be enough to satisfy due process, even for citizens. Congress followed the Court’s lead, only to find itself the victim of a constitutional bait and switch.</p>
<p id="fbabbbdb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the statutory scheme the political branches adopted, and given <i>Hamdi</i>, it simply will not do for the majority to dismiss the CSRT procedures as “far more limited” than those used in military trials, and therefore beneath the level of process “that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review.” The question is not how much process the CSRTs provide in comparison to other modes of adjudication. The question is whether the CSRT procedures — coupled with the judicial review specified by the DTA — provide the “basic process” <i>Hamdi</i> said the Constitution affords American citizens detained as enemy combatants.</p>
<p id="fbabe2ec-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To what basic process are these detainees due as habeas petitioners? We have said that “at the absolute minimum,” the Suspension Clause protects the writ “‘as it existed in 1789.’” The majority admits that a number of historical authorities suggest that at the time of the Constitution’s ratification, “common-law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war.” If this is accurate, the process provided prisoners under the DTA is plainly more than sufficient — it allows alleged combatants to challenge both the factual and legal bases of their detentions.</p>
<p id="fbabe2ed-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming the constitutional baseline is more robust, the DTA still provides adequate process, and by the majority’s own standards. The DTA system — CSRT review of the Executive’s determination followed by D.C. Circuit review for sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the CSRT process — meets these criteria.</p>
<p id="fbabe2ee-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All told, the DTA provides the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay adequate opportunity to contest the bases of their detentions, which is all habeas corpus need allow. The DTA provides more opportunity and more process, in fact, than that afforded prisoners of war or any other alleged enemy combatants in history.</p>
<p id="fbabe2ef-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all its eloquence about the detainees’ right to the writ, the Court makes no effort to elaborate how exactly the remedy it prescribes will differ from the procedural protections detainees enjoy under the DTA. The Court objects to the detainees’ limited access to witnesses and classified material, but proposes no alternatives of its own. Indeed, it simply ignores the many difficult questions its holding presents. What, for example, will become of the CSRT process? The majority says federal courts should generally refrain from entertaining detainee challenges until after the petitioner’s CSRT proceeding has finished. But to what deference, if any, is that CSRT determination entitled?</p>
<p id="fbabe2f0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are other problems. Take witness availability. What makes the majority think witnesses will become magically available when the review procedure is labeled “habeas”? Will the location of most of these witnesses change — will they suddenly become easily susceptible to service of process? Or will subpoenas <span title="384" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-384">p. 384</span>issued by American habeas courts run to Basra? And if they did, how would they be enforced? Speaking of witnesses, will detainees be able to call active-duty military officers as witnesses? If not, why not?</p>
<p id="fbabe2f1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority has no answers for these difficulties. What it does say leaves open the distinct possibility that its “habeas” remedy will, when all is said and done, end up looking a great deal like the DTA review it rejects.</p>
<p id="fbabe2f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority rests its decision on abstract and hypothetical concerns. Step back and consider what, in the real world, Congress and the Executive have actually granted aliens captured by our Armed Forces overseas and found to be enemy combatants:</p>

This statutory scheme provides the combatants held at Guantanamo greater procedural protections than have ever been afforded alleged enemy detainees — whether citizens or aliens — in our national history.</p>
<p id="fbac0a09-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So who has won? Not the detainees. The Court’s analysis leaves them with only the prospect of further litigation to determine the content of their new habeas right, followed by further litigation to resolve their particular cases, followed by further litigation before the D.C. Circuit — where they could have started had they invoked the DTA procedure. Not Congress, whose attempt to “determine — through democratic means — how best” to balance the security of the American people with the detainees’ liberty interests, has been unceremoniously brushed aside. Not the Great Writ, whose majesty is hardly enhanced by its extension to a jurisdictionally quirky outpost, with no tangible benefit to anyone. Not the rule of law, unless by that is meant the rule of lawyers, who will now arguably have a greater role than military and intelligence officials in shaping policy for alien enemy combatants. And certainly not the American people, who today lose a bit more control over the conduct of this Nation’s foreign policy to unelected, politically unaccountable judges.</p>

<p id="fbac0a0b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, for the first time in our Nation’s history, the Court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war. The Chief Justice’s dissent, which I join, <span title="385" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-385">p. 385</span>shows that the procedures prescribed by Congress in the Detainee Treatment Act provide the essential protections that habeas corpus guarantees; there has thus been no suspension of the writ, and no basis exists for judicial intervention beyond what the Act allows. My problem with today’s opinion is more fundamental still: The writ of habeas corpus does not, and never has, run in favor of aliens abroad; the Suspension Clause thus has no application, and the Court’s intervention in this military matter is entirely ultra vires.</p>
<p id="fbac0a0c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.</p>
<p id="fbac0a0d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington, or board a plane anywhere in the country, to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed.</p>
<p id="fbac0a0e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The game of bait-and-switch that today’s opinion plays upon the Nation’s Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court’s blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950), when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President’s Office of Legal Counsel advised him “that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at [Guantanamo Bay].” Memorandum from Patrick F. Philbin and John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorneys General, Office of Legal Counsel, to William J. Haynes II, General Counsel, Dept. of Defense (Dec. 28, 2001). Had the law been otherwise, the military surely would not have transported prisoners there, but would have kept them in Afghanistan, transferred them to another of our foreign military bases, or turned them over to allies for detention. Those other facilities might well have been worse for the detainees themselves.</p>
<p id="fbac0a0f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the long term, then, the Court’s decision today accomplishes little, except perhaps to reduce the well-being of enemy combatants that the Court ostensibly seeks to protect. In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield. See S.Rep. No. 110-90, pt. 7, p. 13 (2007) (Minority Views of Sens. Kyl, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn) (hereinafter Minority Report). Some have been captured or killed. See also Mintz, Released Detainees Rejoining the Fight, Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2004, pp. A1, A12. But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used <span title="386" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-386">p. 386</span>as a human shield against Pakistani commandoes. Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Still another murdered an Afghan judge. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. See White, Ex-Guantanamo Detainee Joined Iraq Suicide Attack, Washington Post, May 8, 2008, p. A18.</p>
<p id="fbac0a10-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These, mind you, were detainees whom the military had concluded were not enemy combatants. Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection. Astoundingly, the Court today raises the bar, requiring military officials to appear before civilian courts and defend their decisions under procedural and evidentiary rules that go beyond what Congress has specified. As The Chief Justice’s dissent makes clear, we have no idea what those procedural and evidentiary rules are, but they will be determined by civil courts and (in the Court’s contemplation at least) will be more detainee-friendly than those now applied, since otherwise there would no reason to hold the congressionally prescribed procedures unconstitutional. If they impose a higher standard of proof (from foreign battlefields) than the current procedures require, the number of the enemy returned to combat will obviously increase.</p>
<p id="fbac0a11-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even when the military has evidence that it can bring forward, it is often foolhardy to release that evidence to the attorneys representing our enemies. And one escalation of procedures that the Court is clear about is affording the detainees increased access to witnesses (perhaps troops serving in Afghanistan?) and to classified information. During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted co-conspirators to the “Blind Sheik’s” defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks. In another case, trial testimony revealed to the enemy that the United States had been monitoring their cellular network, whereupon they promptly stopped using it, enabling more of them to evade capture and continue their atrocities.</p>
<p id="fbac0a12-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And today it is not just the military that the Court elbows aside. A mere two Terms ago in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), when the Court held (quite amazingly) that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 had not stripped habeas jurisdiction over Guantanamo petitioners’ claims, four Members of today’s five-Justice majority joined an opinion saying the following: “Nothing prevents the President from returning to Congress to seek the authority [for trial by military commission] he believes necessary.”</p>
<p id="fbac0a13-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turns out they were just kidding. For in response, Congress, at the President’s request, quickly enacted the Military Commissions Act, emphatically reasserting that it did not want these prisoners filing habeas petitions. It is therefore clear that Congress and the Executive — both political branches — have determined that limiting the role of civilian courts in adjudicating whether prisoners captured abroad are properly detained is important to success in the war that some 190,000 of our men and women are now fighting. As the Solicitor General argued, “the Military Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act . . . represent an effort by the political branches to strike an appropriate balance between the need to preserve liberty and the need to accommodate the weighty and sensitive governmental interests in ensuring that those who have in fact <span title="387" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-387">p. 387</span>fought with the enemy during a war do not return to battle against the United States.”</p>
<p id="fbac0a14-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But it does not matter. The Court today decrees that no good reason to accept the judgment of the other two branches is “apparent.” “The Government,” it declares, “presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees’ claims.” What competence does the Court have to second-guess the judgment of Congress and the President on such a point? None whatever. But the Court blunders in nonetheless. Henceforth, as today’s opinion makes unnervingly clear, how to handle enemy prisoners in this war will ultimately lie with the branch that knows least about the national security concerns that the subject entails.</p>
<p id="fbac0a15-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable “functional” test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson’s opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager. It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into detentions of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner.</p>
<p id="fbac0a16-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.</p>

The order for military tribunals raises many basic questions: Does the president, as commander in chief, have the authority to create military tribunals or is creating courts entirely a congressional power under the Constitution? Can the government suspend provisions of the Bill of Rights in trying noncitizens accused of terrorism or supporting terrorism? More generally, how should the Constitution be interpreted during wartime?</p>

<p id="fbac302f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After denial of their applications by the District Court, petitioners asked leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in this Court. In view of the public importance of the questions raised by their petitions and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay, we directed that petitioners’ applications be set down for full oral argument at a special term of this Court, convened on July 29, 1942.</p>
<p id="fbac3030-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following facts appear from the petitions or are stipulated. Except as noted they are undisputed. All the petitioners were born in Germany; all have lived in the United States. All returned to Germany between 1933 and 1941. All except petitioner Haupt are admittedly citizens of the German Reich, with which the United States is at war. Haupt came to this country with his parents when he was five years old; it is contended that he became a citizen of the United States by virtue of the naturalization of his parents during his minority and that he has not since lost his citizenship. The Government, however, takes the position that on attaining his majority he elected to maintain German allegiance and citizenship or in any case that he has by his conduct renounced or abandoned his United States citizenship. For reasons presently to be stated we do not find it necessary to resolve these contentions.</p>
<p id="fbac3031-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the declaration of war between the United States and the German Reich, petitioners received training at a sabotage school near Berlin, Germany, where they were instructed in the use of explosives and in methods of secret writing.

The four were there landed from the submarine in the hours of darkness, on or about June 13, 1942, carrying with them a supply of explosives, fuses and incendiary and timing devices.

<p id="fbac3032-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining four petitioners at the same French port boarded another German submarine, which carried them across the Atlantic to Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. On or about June 17, 1942, they came ashore during the hours of darkness wearing caps of the German Marine Infantry and carrying with them a supply of explosives, fuses, and incendiary and timing devices. They immediately buried their caps and the other articles mentioned and proceeded in civilian dress to Jacksonville, Florida, and thence to various points in the United States. All were taken into custody in New York or Chicago by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. All had received instructions in Germany from an officer of the German High Command to destroy war industries and war facilities in the United States, for which they or their relatives in Germany were to receive salary payments from the German Government. They also had been paid by the German Government during their course of training at the sabotage school and had received substantial sums in United States currency, which were in their possession when arrested.

On the same day, by Proclamation, the President declared that “all persons who are subjects, citizens or residents of any nation at war with the United States or who give obedience to or act under the direction of any such nation, and who during time of war enter or attempt to enter the United States . . . through coastal or boundary defenses, and are charged with committing or attempting or preparing to commit sabotage, espionage, hostile or warlike acts, or violations of the law of war, shall be subject to the law of war and to the jurisdiction of military tribunals.”</p>
<p id="fbac3034-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Proclamation also stated in terms that all such persons were denied access to the courts.

On July 27th, before petitioners’ applications to the District Court, all the evidence for the prosecution and the defense had been taken by the Commission and the case had been closed except for arguments of counsel. It is conceded that ever since petitioners’ arrest the state and federal courts in Florida, New York, and the District of Columbia, and in the states in which each of the petitioners was arrested or detained, have been open and functioning normally.</p>
<p id="fbac574b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners’ main contention is that the President is without any statutory or constitutional authority to order the petitioners to be tried by military tribunal for offenses with which they are charged; that in consequence they are entitled to be tried in the civil courts with the safeguards, including trial by jury, which the Fifth and Sixth Amendments guarantee to all persons charged in such courts with criminal offenses. In any case it is urged that the President’s Order, in prescribing the procedure of the Commission and the method for review of its findings and sentence, and the proceedings of the Commission under the Order, conflict with Articles of War adopted by Congress and are illegal and void.</p>

But regardless of their merits, it also insists that petitioners must be denied access to the courts, both because they are enemy aliens or have entered our territory as enemy belligerents, and because the President’s Proclamation undertakes in terms to deny such access to the class of persons defined by the Proclamation, which aptly describes the character and conduct of petitioners. It is urged that if they are enemy aliens or if the Proclamation has force no court may afford the petitioners a hearing. But there is certainly nothing in the Proclamation to preclude access to the courts for determining its applicability to the particular case. And neither the Proclamation nor the fact that they are enemy aliens forecloses consideration by the courts of petitioners’ contentions that the Constitution and laws of the United States constitutionally enacted forbid their trial by military commission. [W]e have resolved those questions by our conclusion that the Commission has jurisdiction to try the charge preferred against petitioners. There is therefore no occasion to decide contentions of the parties unrelated to this issue. We pass at once to the consideration of the basis of the Commission’s authority.</p>
<p id="fbac574d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not here concerned with any question of the guilt or innocence of petitioners. Constitutional safeguards for the protection of all who are charged with offenses are not to be disregarded in order to inflict merited punishment on some who are guilty. But the detention and trial of petitioners — ordered by the President in the declared exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief of the Army in time of war and of grave public danger — are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that they are in conflict with the Constitution or laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.</p>
<p id="fbac574e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress and the President, like the courts, possess no power not derived from the Constitution. But one of the objects of the Constitution, as declared by its preamble, is to “provide for the common defence.” As a means to that end the Constitution gives to Congress the power to “provide for the common Defence,” Art. I, §8, cl. 1; “To raise and support Armies,” “To provide and maintain a Navy,” Art. I, §8, cls. 12, 13; and “To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” Art. I, §8, cl. 14. Congress is given authority “To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water,” Art. I, §8, cl. 11; and “To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations,” Art. I, §8, cl. 10. And finally the Constitution authorizes Congress “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18.</p>
<p id="fbac574f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution confers on the President the “executive Power,” Art II, §1, cl. 1, and imposes on him the duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art.

<p id="fbac5750-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the Articles of War, Congress has provided rules for the government of the Army. It has provided for the trial and punishment, by courts martial, of violations of the Articles by members of the armed forces and by specified classes of persons associated or serving with the Army. Arts. 1, 2. But the Articles also recognize the “military commission” appointed by military command as an appropriate tribunal for the trial and punishment of offenses against the law of war <span title="391" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-391">p. 391</span>not ordinarily tried by court martial. <i>See</i> Arts. 12, 15. Articles 38 and 46 authorize the President, with certain limitations, to prescribe the procedure for military commissions. Articles 81 and 82 authorize trial, either by court martial or military commission, of those charged with relieving, harboring or corresponding with the enemy and those charged with spying. And Article 15 declares that “the provisions of these articles conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commission . . . or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions . . . or other military tribunals.” Article 2 includes among those persons subject to military law the personnel of our own military establishment. But this, as Article 12 provides, does not exclude from that class “any other person who by the law of war is subject to trial by military tribunals” and who under Article 12 may be tried by court martial or under Article 15 by military commission.</p>
<p id="fbac5751-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the very beginning of its history this Court has recognized and applied the law of war as including that part of the law of nations which prescribes, for the conduct of war, the status, rights and duties of enemy nations as well as of enemy individuals. By the Articles of War, and especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war in appropriate cases. Congress, in addition to making rules for the government of our Armed Forces, has thus exercised its authority to define and punish offenses against the law of nations by sanctioning, within constitutional limitations, the jurisdiction of military commissions to try persons for offenses which, according to the rules and precepts of the law of nations, and more particularly the law of war, are cognizable by such tribunals. And the President, as Commander in Chief, by his Proclamation in time of war has invoked that law. By his Order creating the present Commission he has undertaken to exercise the authority conferred upon him by Congress, and also such authority as the Constitution itself gives the Commander in Chief, to direct the performance of those functions which may constitutionally be performed by the military arm of the nation in time of war.</p>
<p id="fbac5752-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military command not only to repel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine to what extent the President as Commander in Chief has constitutional power to create military commissions without the support of Congressional legislation. For here Congress has authorized trial of offenses against the law of war before such commissions. We are concerned only with the question whether it is within the constitutional power of the national government to place petitioners upon trial before a military commission for the offenses with which they are charged. We must therefore first inquire whether any of the acts charged is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military tribunal, and if so whether the Constitution prohibits the trial. We may assume that there are acts regarded in other countries, or by some writers on international law, as offenses against the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal here, either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations of the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses constitutionally triable only by a jury. It was upon such grounds that the Court denied <span title="392" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-392">p. 392</span>the right to proceed by military tribunal in <i>Ex parte Milligan</i>, supra. But as we shall show, these petitioners were charged with an offense against the law of war which the Constitution does not require to be tried by jury.</p>
<p id="fbac7e63-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no objection that Congress in providing for the trial of such offenses has not itself undertaken to codify that branch of international law or to mark its precise boundaries, or to enumerate or define by statute all the acts which that law condemns. An Act of Congress punishing “the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations” is an appropriate exercise of its constitutional authority, Art. I, §8, cl. 10, “to define and punish” the offense since it has adopted by reference the sufficiently precise definition of international law. Similarly by the reference in the 15th Article of War to “offenders or offenses that . . . by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions,” Congress has incorporated by reference, as within the jurisdiction of military commissions, all offenses which are defined as such by the law of war and which may constitutionally be included within that jurisdiction. Congress had the choice of crystallizing in permanent form and in minute detail every offense against the law of war, or of adopting the system of common law applied by military tribunals so far as it should be recognized and deemed applicable by the courts. It chose the latter course.</p>
<p id="fbac7e64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By universal agreement and practice the law of war draws a distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful populations of belligerent nations and also between those who are lawful and unlawful combatants. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.</p>
<p id="fbac7e65-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such was the practice of our own military authorities before the adoption of the Constitution, and during the Mexican and Civil Wars. During the Civil War the military commission was extensively used for the trial of offenses against the law of war. By a long course of practical administrative construction by its military authorities, our Government has likewise recognized that those who during time of war pass surreptitiously from enemy territory into our own, discarding their uniforms upon entry, for the commission of hostile acts involving destruction of life or property, have the status of unlawful combatants punishable as such by military commission. This precept of the law of war has been so recognized in practice both here and abroad, and has so generally been accepted as valid by authorities on international law that we think it must be regarded as a rule or principle of the law of war recognized by this Government by its enactment of the Fifteenth Article of War.</p>
<p id="fbac7e66-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This specification so plainly alleges violation of the law of war as to require but brief discussion of petitioners’ contentions. As we have seen, entry upon our territory in time of war by enemy belligerents, including those acting under the direction of the armed forces of the enemy, for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war, is a hostile and war-like act. It subjects those who participate in it without uniform to the punishment <span title="393" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-393">p. 393</span>prescribed by the law of war for unlawful belligerents. It is without significance that petitioners were not alleged to have borne conventional weapons or that their proposed hostile acts did not necessarily contemplate collision with the Armed Forces of the United States. Paragraphs 351 and 352 of the Rules of Land Warfare, already referred to, plainly contemplate that the hostile acts and purposes for which unlawful belligerents may be punished are not limited to assaults on the Armed Forces of the United States. Modern warfare is directed at the destruction of enemy war supplies and the implements of their production and transportation quite as much as at the armed forces. Every consideration which makes the unlawful belligerent punishable is equally applicable whether his objective is the one or the other. The law of war cannot rightly treat those agents of enemy armies who enter our territory, armed with explosives intended for the destruction of war industries and supplies, as any the less belligerent enemies than are agents similarly entering for the purpose of destroying fortified places or our Armed Forces. By passing our boundaries for such purposes without uniform or other emblem signifying their belligerent status, or by discarding that means of identification after entry, such enemies become unlawful belligerents subject to trial and punishment.</p>
<p id="fbac7e67-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Citizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency which is unlawful because in violation of the law of war. Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy government, and with its aid, guidance and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the Hague Convention and the law of war. It is as an enemy belligerent that petitioner Haupt is charged with entering the United States, and unlawful belligerency is the gravamen of the offense of which he is accused.</p>
<p id="fbac7e68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor are petitioners any the less belligerents if, as they argue, they have not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations. The argument leaves out of account the nature of the offense which the Government charges and which the Act of Congress, by incorporating the law of war, punishes. It is that each petitioner, in circumstances which gave him the status of an enemy belligerent, passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose. The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered — or, having so entered, they remained upon — our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification. For that reason, even when committed by a citizen, the offense is distinct from the crime of treason defined in Article III, §3 of the Constitution, since the absence of uniform essential to one is irrelevant to the other.</p>
<p id="fbac7e69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But petitioners insist that even if the offenses with which they are charged are offenses against the law of war, their trial is subject to the requirement of the Fifth Amendment that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, and that such trials by Article III, §2, and the Sixth Amendment must be by jury in a civil court. Before the Amendments, §2 of Article III, the Judiciary Article, had provided: “The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury,” and had directed that “such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.”</p>
<p id="fbac7e6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Presentment by a grand jury and trial by a jury of the vicinage where the crime was committed were at the time of the adoption of the Constitution familiar <span title="394" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-394">p. 394</span>parts of the machinery for criminal trials in the civil courts. But they were procedures unknown to military tribunals, which are not courts in the sense of the Judiciary Article, and which in the natural course of events are usually called upon to function under conditions precluding resort to such procedures. As this Court has often recognized, it was not the purpose or effect of §2 of Article III, read in the light of the common law, to enlarge the then existing right to a jury trial. The object was to preserve unimpaired trial by jury in all those cases in which it had been recognized by the common law and in all cases of a like nature as they might arise in the future, but not to bring within the sweep of the guaranty those cases in which it was then well understood that a jury trial could not be demanded as of right. The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, while guaranteeing the continuance of certain incidents of trial by jury which Article III, §2 had left unmentioned, did not enlarge the right to jury trial as it had been established by that Article.</p>
<p id="fbac7e6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All these are instances of offenses committed against the United States, for which a penalty is imposed, but they are not deemed to be within the provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments relating to “crimes” and “criminal prosecutions.” In the light of this long-continued and consistent interpretation we must conclude that §2 of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments cannot be taken to have extended the right to demand a jury to trials by military commission, or to have required that offenses against the law of war not triable by jury at common law be tried only in the civil courts. It has not hitherto been challenged, and so far as we are advised it has never been suggested in the very extensive literature of the subject that an alien spy, in time of war, could not be tried by military tribunal without a jury.</p>
<p id="fbac7e6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exception from the Amendments of “cases arising in the land or naval forces” was not aimed at trials by military tribunals, without a jury, of such offenses against the law of war. Its objective was quite different — to authorize the trial by court martial of the members of our Armed Forces for all that class of crimes which under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments might otherwise have been deemed triable in the civil courts. The cases mentioned in the exception are not restricted to those involving offenses against the law of war alone, but extend to trial of all offenses, including crimes which were of the class traditionally triable by jury at common law.</p>
<p id="fbac7e6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot say that Congress in preparing the Fifth and Sixth Amendments intended to extend trial by jury to the cases of alien or citizen offenders against the law of war otherwise triable by military commission, while withholding it from members of our own armed forces charged with infractions of the Articles of War punishable by death. It is equally inadmissible to construe the Amendments — whose primary purpose was to continue unimpaired presentment by grand jury and trial by petit jury in all those cases in which they had been customary — as either abolishing all trials by military tribunals, save those of the personnel of our own armed forces, or what in effect comes to the same thing, as imposing on all such tribunals the necessity of proceeding against unlawful enemy belligerents only on presentment and trial by jury. We conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not restrict whatever authority was conferred by the Constitution to try offenses against the law of war by military commission, and that petitioners, charged with such an offense not required to be tried by jury at common law, were lawfully placed on trial by the Commission without a jury.</p>
<p id="fbac7e6e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="395" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-395">p. 395</span>Accordingly, we conclude that Charge I, on which petitioners were detained for trial by the Military Commission, alleged an offense which the President is authorized to order tried by military commission; that his Order convening the Commission was a lawful order and that the Commission was lawfully constituted; that the petitioners were held in lawful custody and did not show cause for their discharge.</p>

The Court found that the procedures violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Accords. The Court did not consider the constitutional issues raised. Congress responded by enacting the Military Commission Act of 2006.

Under rational basis review, a court asks only whether there is a conceivable permissible purpose for the government’s action; its actual purpose is irrelevant.

<p id="fbaca58a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States undergo a vetting process to ensure that they satisfy the numerous requirements for admission. The Act also vests the President with authority to restrict the entry of aliens whenever he finds that their entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” Relying on that delegation, the President concluded that it was necessary to impose entry restrictions on nationals of countries that do not share adequate information for an informed entry determination, or that otherwise present national security risks. The plaintiffs in this litigation, respondents here, challenged the application of those entry restrictions to certain aliens abroad. We now decide whether the President had authority under the Act to issue the Proclamation, and whether the entry policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p><span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-396">p. 396</span>

<p id="fbaca58c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after taking office, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. EO-1 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review to examine the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments about their nationals seeking to enter the United States. Pending that review, the order suspended for 90 days the entry of foreign nationals from seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — that had been previously identified by Congress or prior administrations as posing heightened terrorism risks. The District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a temporary restraining order blocking the entry restrictions, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s request to stay that order.</p>
<p id="fbaccc9d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, the President revoked EO-1, replacing it with Executive Order No. 13780, which again directed a worldwide review. Citing investigative burdens on agencies and the need to diminish the risk that dangerous individuals would enter without adequate vetting, EO-2 also temporarily restricted the entry (with case-by-case waivers) of foreign nationals from six of the countries covered by EO-1: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The order explained that those countries had been selected because each ”is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.” The entry restriction was to stay in effect for 90 days, pending completion of the worldwide review.</p>
<p id="fbaccc9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These interim measures were immediately challenged in court. The District Courts for the Districts of Maryland and Hawaii entered nationwide preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the entry suspension, and the respective Courts of Appeals upheld those injunctions, albeit on different grounds. The temporary restrictions in EO-2 expired before this Court took any action, and we vacated the lower court decisions as moot.</p>
<p id="fbaccc9f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 24, 2017, after completion of the worldwide review, the President issued the Proclamation before us — Proclamation No. 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats. The Proclamation (as its title indicates) sought to improve vetting procedures by identifying ongoing deficiencies in the information needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries present “public safety threats.” To further that purpose, the Proclamation placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate.</p>
<p id="fbaccca0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the 50-day period, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security concluded that eight countries — Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen — remained deficient in terms of their risk profile and willingness to provide requested information. The Proclamation further directs DHS to assess on a continuing basis whether entry restrictions should be modified or continued, and to report to the President every 180 days. §4. Upon completion of the first such review period, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary of Homeland Security, determined that Chad had sufficiently improved its practices, and he accordingly lifted restrictions on its nationals.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="fbaccca3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”</p>
</div>
<p id="fbaccca4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By its terms, §1182(f) exudes deference to the President in every clause. It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry (“[w]henever [he] finds that the entry” of aliens “would be detrimental” to the national interest); whose entry to suspend (“all aliens or any class of aliens”); for how long (“for such period as he shall deem necessary”); and on what conditions (“any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate”).</p>
<p id="fbaccca5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Proclamation falls well within this comprehensive delegation. The sole prerequisite set forth in §1182(f) is that the President “find[ ]” that the entry of the covered aliens “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.</p>
<p id="fbaccca6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ final statutory argument is that the President’s entry suspension violates §1152(a)(1)(A), which provides that “no person shall . . . be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.” In any event, we reject plaintiffs’ interpretation because it ignores the basic distinction between admissibility determinations and visa issuance that runs throughout the INA.</p>
<p id="fbaccca7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction between admissibility — to which §1152(a)(1)(A) does not apply — and visa issuance — to which it does — is apparent from the text of the provision, which specifies only that its protections apply to the “issuance” of “immigrant visa[s],” without mentioning admissibility or entry. Had Congress instead intended in §1152(a)(1)(A) to constrain the President’s power to determine who may enter the country, it could easily have chosen language directed to that end.</p>
<p id="fbaccca8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common sense and historical practice confirm as much. Section 1152(a)(1)(A) has never been treated as a constraint on the criteria for admissibility in §1182.

<p id="fbacf3bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases recognize that “[t]he clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.” Plaintiffs believe that the Proclamation violates this prohibition by singling out Muslims for disfavored treatment. The entry suspension, they contend, operates as a “religious gerrymander,” in part because most of the countries covered by the Proclamation have Muslim-majority populations. Relying <span title="398" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-398">p. 398</span>on Establishment Clause precedents concerning laws and policies applied domestically, plaintiffs allege that the primary purpose of the Proclamation was religious animus and that the President’s stated concerns about vetting protocols and national security were but pretexts for discriminating against Muslims.</p>
<p id="fbacf3bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the heart of plaintiffs’ case is a series of statements by the President and his advisers casting doubt on the official objective of the Proclamation. For example, while a candidate on the campaign trail, the President published a “Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration” that called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” Then-candidate Trump also stated that “Islam hates us” and asserted that the United States was “having problems with Muslims coming into the country.” Shortly after being elected, when asked whether violence in Europe had affected his plans to “ban Muslim immigration,” the President replied, “You know my plans. All along, I’ve been proven to be right.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One week after his inauguration, the President issued EO-1. In a television interview, one of the President’s campaign advisers explained that when the President “first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’” The adviser said he assembled a group of Members of Congress and lawyers that “focused on, instead of religion, danger. . . . [The order] is based on places where there [is] substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs also note that after issuing EO-2 to replace EO-1, the President expressed regret that his prior order had been “watered down” and called for a “much tougher version” of his “Travel Ban.” Shortly before the release of the Proclamation, he stated that the “travel ban . . . should be far larger, tougher, and more specific,” but “stupidly that would not be politically correct.” More recently, on November 29, 2017, the President retweeted links to three anti-Muslim propaganda videos. In response to questions about those videos, the President’s deputy press secretary denied that the President thinks Muslims are a threat to the United States, explaining that “the President has been talking about these security issues for years now, from the campaign trail to the White House” and “has addressed these issues with the travel order that he issued earlier this year and the companion proclamation.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3bf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President of the United States possesses an extraordinary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf. Our Presidents have frequently used that power to espouse the principles of religious freedom and tolerance on which this Nation was founded.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue that this President’s words strike at fundamental standards of respect and tolerance, in violation of our constitutional tradition. But the issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements. It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case before us differs in numerous respects from the conventional Establishment Clause claim. Unlike the typical suit involving religious displays or school prayer, plaintiffs seek to invalidate a national security directive regulating the entry of aliens abroad. Their claim accordingly raises a number of delicate issues regarding the scope of the constitutional right and the manner of <span title="399" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-399">p. 399</span>proof. The Proclamation, moreover, is facially neutral toward religion. Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to probe the sincerity of the stated justifications for the policy by reference to extrinsic statements — many of which were made before the President took the oath of office. These various aspects of plaintiffs’ challenge inform our standard of review.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than a century, this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a “fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from judicial control.” Because decisions in these matters may implicate “relations with foreign powers,” or involve “classifications defined in the light of changing political and economic circumstances,” such judgments “are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3c3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, although foreign nationals seeking admission have no constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[J]udicial inquiry into the national-security realm raises concerns for the separation of powers” by intruding on the President’s constitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs. For another, “when it comes to collecting evidence and drawing inferences” on questions of national security, “the lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot of our cases in this context is clear: “Any rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility” of the President “to respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,” and our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained. For our purposes today, we assume that we may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying rational basis review. That standard of review considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government’s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes. As a result, we may consider plaintiffs’ extrinsic evidence, but will uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the standard of review, it should come as no surprise that the Court hardly ever strikes down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny. On the few occasions where we have done so, a common thread has been that the laws at issue lack any purpose other than a “bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.”</p>
<p id="fbacf3c7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Proclamation does not fit this pattern. It cannot be said that it is impossible to “discern a relationship to legitimate state interests” or that the policy is “inexplicable by anything but animus.” Indeed, the dissent can only attempt to argue otherwise by refusing to apply anything resembling rational basis review. But because there is persuasive evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility, we must accept that independent justification.</p>
<p id="fbacf3c8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices. The text says nothing about religion. Plaintiffs and the dissent nonetheless emphasize that five of the seven nations currently included in the Proclamation have Muslim-majority populations. Yet that fact alone does not support an inference of religious hostility, given that the policy <span title="400" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-400">p. 400</span>covers just 8% of the world’s Muslim population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.</p>
<p id="fbad1ad9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Proclamation, moreover, reflects the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their agencies.</p>
<p id="fbad1ada-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the dissent invokes Korematsu v. United States (1944). Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, <i>Korematsu </i>has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority. But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission. The entry suspension is an act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President — the only question is evaluating the actions of this particular President in promulgating an otherwise valid Proclamation.</p>
<p id="fbad1adb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent’s reference to <i>Korematsu,</i> however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: <i>Korematsu</i> was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — “has no place in law under the Constitution.”</p>
<p id="fbad1adc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under these circumstances, the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review. We express no view on the soundness of the policy. We simply hold today that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim. Because plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, we reverse the grant of the preliminary injunction as an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p id="fbad1add-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kennedy</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="fbad1ade-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the Court’s opinion in full. In all events, it is appropriate to make this further observation. There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of Government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention. That does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects. The oath that all officials take to adhere to the Constitution is not confined to those spheres in which the Judiciary can correct or even comment upon what those officials say or do. Indeed, the very fact that an official may have broad discretion, discretion free from judicial scrutiny, makes it all the more imperative for him or her to adhere to the Constitution and to its meaning and its promise.</p>
<p id="fbad1adf-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment prohibits the establishment of religion and promises the free exercise of religion. From these safeguards, and from the guarantee of freedom of speech, it follows there is freedom of belief and expression. It is an urgent necessity that officials adhere to these constitutional guarantees and mandates in all their actions, even in the sphere of foreign affairs. An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Breyer</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Kagan</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before us is whether Proclamation No. 9645 is lawful. If its promulgation or content was significantly affected by religious animus against <span title="401" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-401">p. 401</span>Muslims, it would violate the relevant statute or the First Amendment itself. If, however, its sole <i>ratio decidendi</i> was one of national security, then it would be unlikely to violate either the statute or the Constitution. Which is it? Members of the Court principally disagree about the answer to this question, <i>i.e., </i>about whether or the extent to which religious animus played a significant role in the Proclamation’s promulgation or content.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the Proclamation’s elaborate system of exemptions and waivers can and should help us answer this question. That system provides for case-by-case consideration of persons who may qualify for visas despite the Proclamation’s general ban. Those persons include lawful permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, students, children, and numerous others. There are likely many such persons, perhaps in the thousands. And I believe it appropriate to take account of their Proclamation-granted status when considering the Proclamation’s lawfulness.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, since the case-by-case exemptions and waivers apply without regard to the individual’s religion, application of that system would help make clear that the Proclamation does not deny visas to numerous Muslim individuals (from those countries) who do not pose a security threat. And that fact would help to rebut the First Amendment claim that the Proclamation rests upon anti-Muslim bias rather than security need. Finally, of course, the very fact that Muslims from those countries would enter the United States (under Proclamation-provided exemptions and waivers) would help to show the same thing.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, if the Government is <i>not </i>applying the system of exemptions and waivers that the Proclamation contains, then its argument for the Proclamation’s lawfulness becomes significantly weaker. And, perhaps most importantly, if the Government is not applying the Proclamation’s exemption and waiver system, the claim that the Proclamation is a “Muslim ban,” rather than a “security-based” ban, becomes much stronger. How could the Government successfully claim that the Proclamation rests on security needs if it is excluding Muslims who satisfy the Proclamation’s own terms? At the same time, denying visas to Muslims who meet the Proclamation’s own security terms would support the view that the Government excludes them for reasons based upon their religion.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unfortunately there is evidence that supports the second possibility, <i>i.e., </i>that the Government is not applying the Proclamation as written. An examination of publicly available statistics also provides cause for concern. The State Department reported that during the Proclamation’s first month, two waivers were approved out of 6,555 eligible applicants. In its reply brief, the Government claims that number increased from 2 to 430 during the first four months of implementation. That number, 430, however, when compared with the number of pre-Proclamation visitors, accounts for a miniscule percentage of those likely eligible for visas, in such categories as persons requiring medical treatment, academic visitors, students, family members, and others belonging to groups that, when considered as a group (rather than case by case), would not seem to pose security threats.</p>
<p id="fbad1ae6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Amici</i> have suggested that there are numerous applicants who could meet the waiver criteria. Other data suggest the same. The Proclamation does not apply to asylum seekers or refugees. Yet few refugees have been admitted since the Proclamation took effect. While more than 15,000 Syrian refugees arrived in the United States in 2016, only 13 have arrived since January 2018.</p>
<p id="fbad41f7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="402" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-402">p. 402</span>Declarations, anecdotal evidence, facts, and numbers taken from <i>amicus </i>briefs are not judicial factfindings. The Government has not had an opportunity to respond, and a court has not had an opportunity to decide. But, given the importance of the decision in this case, the need for assurance that the Proclamation does not rest upon a “Muslim ban,” and the assistance in deciding the issue that answers to the “exemption and waiver” questions may provide, I would send this case back to the District Court for further proceedings. And, I would leave the injunction in effect while the matter is litigated. Regardless, the Court’s decision today leaves the District Court free to explore these issues on remand.</p>
<p id="fbad41f8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor</span>, with whom Justice <span class="epub-small-caps">Ginsburg</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="fbad41f9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States of America is a Nation built upon the promise of religious liberty. Our Founders honored that core promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in the First Amendment. The Court’s decision today fails to safeguard that fundamental principle. It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a ”total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” because the policy now masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns. But this repackaging does little to cleanse Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 of the appearance of discrimination that the President’s words have created. Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus. That alone suffices to show that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim. The majority holds otherwise by ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens. Because that troubling result runs contrary to the Constitution and our precedent, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbad41fb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the merits of plaintiffs’ complex statutory claims, the Proclamation must be enjoined for a more fundamental reason: It runs afoul of the Establishment Clause’s guarantee of religious neutrality.</p>
<p id="fbad41fc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Establishment Clause forbids government policies “respecting an establishment of religion.” The “clearest command” of the Establishment Clause is that the Government cannot favor or disfavor one religion over another. ”When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose” of disfavoring a particular religion, “it violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the government’s ostensible object is to take sides.” To determine whether plaintiffs have proved an Establishment Clause violation, the Court asks whether a reasonable observer would view the government action as enacted for the purpose of disfavoring a religion.</p>
<p id="fbad41fd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering that question, this Court has generally considered the text of the government policy, its operation, and any available evidence regarding “the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by” the decisionmaker.</p>
<p id="fbad41fe-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-403">p. 403</span>Although the majority briefly recounts a few of the statements and background events that form the basis of plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge, that highly abridged account does not tell even half of the story. The full record paints a far more harrowing picture, from which a reasonable observer would readily conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by hostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.</p>
<p id="fbad41ff-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During his Presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged that, if elected, he would ban Muslims from entering the United States. Specifically, on December 7, 2015, he issued a formal statement “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” That statement remained on his campaign website until May 2017 (several months into his Presidency).</p>
<p id="fbad4200-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 8, 2015, Trump justified his proposal during a television interview by noting that President Franklin D. Roosevelt “did the same thing” with respect to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In January 2016, during a Republican primary debate, Trump was asked whether he wanted to “rethink [his] position” on “banning Muslims from entering the country.” He answered, “No.” A month later, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump told an apocryphal story about United States General John J. Pershing killing a large group of Muslim insurgents in the Philippines with bullets dipped in pigs’ blood in the early 1900’s. In March 2016, he expressed his belief that “Islam hates us. . . . [W]e can’t allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States . . . [a]nd of people that are not Muslim.” That same month, Trump asserted that “[w]e’re having problems with the Muslims, and we’re having problems with Muslims coming into the country.” He therefore called for surveillance of mosques in the United States, blaming terrorist attacks on Muslims’ lack of “assimilation” and their commitment to “sharia law.” A day later, he opined that Muslims “do not respect us at all” and “don’t respect a lot of the things that are happening throughout not only our country, but they don’t respect other things.”</p>
<p id="fbad4201-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Trump’s presidential campaign progressed, he began to describe his policy proposal in slightly different terms. In June 2016, for instance, he characterized the policy proposal as a suspension of immigration from countries “where there’s a proven history of terrorism.” He also described the proposal as rooted in the need to stop “importing radical Islamic terrorism to the West through a failed immigration system.” Asked in July 2016 whether he was “pull[ing] back from” his pledged Muslim ban, Trump responded, “I actually don’t think it’s a rollback. In fact, you could say it’s an expansion.” He then explained that he used different terminology because “[p]eople were so upset when [he] used the word Muslim.”</p>
<p id="fbad4202-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A month before the 2016 election, Trump reiterated that his proposed “Muslim ban” had “morphed into a[n] extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.” Then, on December 21, 2016, President-elect Trump was asked whether he would “rethink” his previous “plans to create a Muslim registry or ban Muslim immigration.” He replied: “You know my plans. All along, I’ve proven to be right.”</p>
<p id="fbad4203-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 27, 2017, one week after taking office, President Trump signed entitled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.” As he signed it, President Trump read the title, looked up, and said “We all know what that means.” That same day, President Trump explained to the <span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-404">p. 404</span>media that, under EO-1, Christians would be given priority for entry as refugees into the United States. The following day, one of President Trump’s key advisers candidly drew the connection between EO-1 and the “Muslim ban” that the President had pledged to implement if elected. According to that adviser, “[W]hen [Donald Trump] first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’”</p>
<p id="fbad4204-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While litigation over EO-2 was ongoing, President Trump repeatedly made statements alluding to a desire to keep Muslims out of the country. For instance, he said at a rally of his supporters that EO-2 was just a “watered down version of the first one” and had been “tailor[ed]” at the behest of “the lawyers.” He further added that he would prefer “to go back to the first [executive order] and go all the way” and reiterated his belief that it was “very hard” for Muslims to assimilate into Western culture. Then, on August 17, 2017, President Trump issued yet another tweet about Islam, once more referencing the story about General Pershing’s massacre of Muslims in the Philippines: “Study what General Pershing . . . did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!”</p>
<p id="fbad4205-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September 2017, President Trump tweeted that “[t]he travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific — but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” . . . On November 29, 2017, President Trump “retweeted” three anti-Muslim videos, entitled “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!”, “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!”, and “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!”</p>
<p id="fbad6916-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority correctly notes, “the issue before us is not whether to denounce” these offensive statements. Rather, the dispositive and narrow question here is whether a reasonable observer, presented with all “openly available data,” the text and “historical context” of the Proclamation, and the “specific sequence of events” leading to it, would conclude that the primary purpose of the Proclamation is to disfavor Islam and its adherents by excluding them from the country. The answer is unquestionably yes.</p>
<p id="fbad6917-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taking all the relevant evidence together, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was driven primarily by anti-Muslim animus, rather than by the Government’s asserted national-security justifications. Moreover, despite several opportunities to do so, President Trump has never disavowed any of his prior statements about Islam. Instead, he has continued to make remarks that a reasonable observer would view as an unrelenting attack on the Muslim religion and its followers. Given President Trump’s failure to correct the reasonable perception of his apparent hostility toward the Islamic faith, it is unsurprising that the President’s lawyers have, at every step in the lower courts, failed in their attempts to launder the Proclamation of its discriminatory taint.</p>
<p id="fbad6918-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, what began as a policy explicitly “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” has since morphed into a “Proclamation” putatively based on national-security concerns. But this new window dressing cannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the President and his advisers create the strong perception that the Proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers.</p>

The majority accepts that invitation and incorrectly applies a watered-down legal standard in an effort to short circuit plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim.</p>
<p id="fbad691b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even under rational-basis review, the Proclamation must fall. That is so because the Proclamation is “‘divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests,’ and ‘its sheer breadth [is] so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it’” that the policy is “‘inexplicable by anything but animus.’”</p>
<p id="fbad691c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, none of the features of the Proclamation highlighted by the majority supports the Government’s claim that the Proclamation is genuinely and primarily rooted in a legitimate national-security interest. What the unrebutted evidence actually shows is that a reasonable observer would conclude, quite easily, that the primary purpose and function of the Proclamation is to disfavor Islam by banning Muslims from entering our country.</p>

<p id="fbad902e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The First Amendment stands as a bulwark against official religious prejudice and embodies our Nation’s deep commitment to religious plurality and tolerance. That constitutional promise is why, “[f]or centuries now, people have come to this country from every corner of the world to share in the blessing of religious freedom.” Instead of vindicating those principles, today’s decision tosses them aside. In holding that the First Amendment gives way to an executive policy that a reasonable observer would view as motivated by animus against Muslims, the majority opinion upends this Court’s precedent, repeats tragic mistakes of the past, and denies countless individuals the fundamental right of religious liberty.</p>
<p id="fbad902f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just weeks ago, the Court rendered its decision in which applied the bedrock principles of religious neutrality and tolerance in considering a First Amendment challenge to government action. Those principles should apply equally here. In both instances, the question is whether a government actor exhibited tolerance and neutrality in reaching a decision that affects individuals’ fundamental religious freedom. But unlike in <i>Masterpiece,</i> where a state civil rights commission was found to have acted without “the neutrality that the Free Exercise Clause requires,” the government actors in this case will not be held accountable for breaching the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious neutrality and tolerance. Unlike in <i>Masterpiece,</i> where the majority considered the state commissioners’ statements about religion to be persuasive evidence of unconstitutional government action, the majority here completely sets aside the President’s charged statements about Muslims as irrelevant. That holding erodes the foundational principles of religious tolerance that the Court elsewhere has so emphatically protected, and it tells members of minority religions in our country “‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community.’”</p>
<p id="fbad9030-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s holding is all the more troubling given the stark parallels between the reasoning of this case and that of Korematsu v. United States <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>(1944)<i>.</i> In <i>Korematsu,</i> the Court gave ”a pass [to] an odious, gravely injurious racial classification” authorized by an executive order. As here, the Government invoked an ill-defined national-security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweeping proportion. As here, the exclusion order was rooted in dangerous stereotypes about, <i>inter alia,</i> a particular group’s supposed inability to assimilate and desire to harm the United States. As here, the Government was unwilling to reveal its own intelligence agencies’ views of the alleged security concerns to the very citizens it purported to protect. And as here, there was strong evidence that impermissible hostility and animus motivated the Government’s policy.</p>
<p id="fbad9031-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, the Court takes the important step of finally overruling <i>Korematsu</i>, denouncing it as “gravely wrong the day it was decided.” This formal repudiation of a shameful precedent is laudable and long overdue. But it does not make the majority’s decision here acceptable or right. By blindly accepting the Government’s misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the Court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying <i>Korematsu</i> and merely replaces one “gravely wrong” decision with another.</p>
<p id="fbad9032-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our Constitution demands, and our country deserves, a Judiciary willing to hold the coordinate branches to account when they defy our most sacred legal commitments. Because the Court’s decision today has failed in that respect, with profound regret, I dissent.</p>

<p id="fbadb751-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1970 the respondent A. Ernest Fitzgerald lost his job as a management analyst with the Department of the Air Force. Fitzgerald’s dismissal occurred in the context of a departmental reorganization and reduction in force, in which his job was eliminated. In announcing the reorganization, the Air Force characterized the action as taken to promote economy and efficiency in the Armed Forces.</p>
<p id="fbadb752-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent’s discharge attracted unusual attention in Congress and in the press. Fitzgerald had attained national prominence approximately one year earlier, during the waning months of the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. On November 13, 1968, Fitzgerald appeared before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress. To the evident embarrassment of his superiors in the Department of Defense, Fitzgerald testified that cost-overruns on the C-5A transport plane could approximate $2 billion. He also revealed that unexpected technical difficulties had arisen during the development of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="fbadb753-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fitzgerald’s proposed reassignment encountered resistance within the administration. In an internal memorandum of January 20, 1970, White House aide Alexander Butterfield reported to Haldeman that “‘Fitzgerald is no doubt a top-notch cost expert, but he must be given very low marks in loyalty; and after all, loyalty is the name of the game.’” Butterfield therefore recommended that “‘[W]e should let him bleed, for a while at least.’” There is no evidence of White House efforts to reemploy Fitzgerald subsequent to the Butterfield memorandum.</p>
<p id="fbadde64-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a news conference on January 31, 1973, the President was asked about [Fitzgerald’s firing]. Mr. Nixon took the opportunity to assume personal responsibility for Fitzgerald’s dismissal:</p>

<p id="fbadde68-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case now presents the claim that the President of the United States is shielded by absolute immunity from civil damages liability. In the case of the President the inquiries into history and policy, though mandated independently by our cases, tend to converge. Because the Presidency did not exist through most of the development of common law, any historical analysis must draw its <span title="408" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-408">p. 408</span>evidence primarily from our constitutional heritage and structure. Historical inquiry thus merges almost at its inception with the kind of “public policy” analysis appropriately undertaken by a federal court. This inquiry involves policies and principles that may be considered implicit in the nature of the President’s office in a system structured to achieve effective government under a constitutionally mandated separation of powers.</p>
<p id="fbadde69-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here a former President asserts his immunity from civil damages claims of two kinds. He stands named as a defendant in a direct action under the Constitution and in two statutory actions under federal laws of general applicability. In neither case has Congress taken express legislative action to subject the President to civil liability for his official acts.</p>
<p id="fbadde6a-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the principles of our cases to claims of this kind, we hold that petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts. We consider this immunity a functionally mandated incident of the President’s unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.</p>
<p id="fbadde6b-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President occupies a unique position in the constitutional scheme. Article II, §1, of the Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States. . . .” This grant of authority establishes the President as the chief constitutional officer of the Executive Branch, entrusted with supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity. These include the enforcement of federal law — it is the President who is charged constitutionally to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”; the conduct of foreign affairs — a realm in which the Court has recognized that “[i]t would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly held secret”; and management of the Executive Branch — a task for which “imperative reasons requir[e] an unrestricted power [in the President] to remove the most important of his subordinates in their most important duties.”</p>
<p id="fbadde6c-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In arguing that the President is entitled only to qualified immunity, the respondent relies on cases in which we have recognized immunity of this scope for governors and cabinet officers. We find these cases to be inapposite. The President’s unique status under the Constitution distinguishes him from other executive officials.</p>
<p id="fbadde6d-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the singular importance of the President’s duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government. As is the case with prosecutors and judges — for whom absolute immunity now is established — a President must concern himself with matters likely to “arouse the most intense feelings.” Yet, as our decisions have recognized, it is in precisely such cases that there exists the greatest public interest in providing an official “the maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially with” the duties of his office. This concern is compelling where the officeholder must make the most sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted to any official under our constitutional system. Nor can the sheer prominence of the President’s office be ignored. In view of the visibility of his office and the effect of his actions on countless people, the President would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil damages. Cognizance of this personal vulnerability frequently could distract a President from his public duties, to the detriment of not only the President and his office but also the Nation that the Presidency was designed to serve.</p>
<p id="fbadde6e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="409" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-409">p. 409</span>A rule of absolute immunity for the President will not leave the Nation without sufficient protection against misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive. There remains the constitutional remedy of impeachment. In addition, there are formal and informal checks on Presidential action that do not apply with equal force to other executive officials. The President is subjected to constant scrutiny by the press. Vigilant oversight by Congress also may serve to deter Presidential abuses of office, as well as to make credible the threat of impeachment. Other incentives to avoid misconduct may include a desire to earn reelection, the need to maintain prestige as an element of Presidential influence, and a President’s traditional concern for his historical stature.</p>
<p id="fbadde6f-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of alternative remedies and deterrents establishes that absolute immunity will not place the President “above the law.” For the President, as for judges and prosecutors, absolute immunity merely precludes a particular private remedy for alleged misconduct in order to advance compelling public ends.</p>

<p id="fbae0581-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Marbury v. Madison (1803), the Court, speaking through the Chief Justice, observed that while there were “important political powers” committed to the President for the performance of which neither he nor his appointees were accountable in court, “the question, whether the legality of an act of the head of a department be examinable in a court of justice or not, must always depend on the nature of that act.” The Court nevertheless refuses to follow this course with respect to the President. It makes no effort to distinguish categories of Presidential conduct that should be absolutely immune from other categories of conduct that should not qualify for that level of immunity. The Court instead concludes that whatever the President does and however contrary to law he knows his conduct to be, he may, without fear of liability, injure federal employees or any other person within or without the Government.</p>
<p id="fbae0582-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attaching absolute immunity to the Office of the President, rather than to particular activities that the President might perform, places the President above the law. It is a reversion to the old notion that the King can do no wrong. Until now, this concept had survived in this country only in the form of sovereign immunity. That doctrine forecloses suit against the Government itself and against Government officials, but only when the suit against the latter actually seeks relief against the sovereign. Suit against an officer, however, may be maintained where it seeks specific relief against him for conduct contrary to his statutory authority or to the Constitution. Now, however, the Court clothes the Office of the President with sovereign immunity, placing it beyond the law.</p>
<p id="fbae0583-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Marbury v. Madison, the Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, observed: “The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.” Until now, the Court has consistently adhered to this proposition. In Scheuer v. Rhodes (1974), a unanimous Court held that the Governor of a State was entitled only to a qualified immunity.</p>
<p id="fbae0584-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unfortunately, the Court now abandons basic principles that have been powerful guides to decision. It is particularly unfortunate since the judgment in this case has few, if any, indicia of a judicial decision; it is almost wholly a <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>policy choice, a choice that is without substantial support and that in all events is ambiguous in its reach and import.</p>

<p id="fbae2c9e-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 6, 1994, she commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by filing a complaint naming petitioner and Danny Ferguson, a former Arkansas State Police officer, as defendants.

She alleges that Ferguson persuaded her to leave her desk and to visit the Governor in a business suite at the hotel, where he made “abhorrent” sexual advances that she vehemently rejected.

<p id="fbae2ca3-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Only three sitting Presidents have been defendants in civil litigation involving their actions prior to taking office. Complaints against Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman had been dismissed before they took office; the dismissals were affirmed after their respective inaugurations. Two companion cases arising out of an automobile accident were filed against John F. Kennedy in 1960 during the Presidential campaign. After taking office, he unsuccessfully argued that his status as Commander in Chief gave him a right to a stay under the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940. The motion for a stay was denied by the District Court, and the matter was settled out of court. Thus, none of those cases sheds any light on the constitutional issue before us.</p>
<p id="fbae2ca4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal rationale for affording certain public servants immunity from suits for money damages arising out of their official acts is inapplicable to unofficial conduct. In cases involving prosecutors, legislators, and judges we have repeatedly explained that the immunity serves the public interest in enabling such officials to perform their designated functions effectively without fear that a particular decision may give rise to personal liability.</p>
<p id="fbae2ca5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This reasoning provides no support for an immunity for unofficial conduct. As we explained in <i>Fitzgerald</i>, “the sphere of protected action must be related closely to the immunity’s justifying purposes.” Because of the President’s broad responsibilities, we recognized in that case an immunity from damages claims arising out of official acts extending to the “outer perimeter of his authority.” But we have never suggested that the President, or any other official, has an immunity that extends beyond the scope of any action taken in an official capacity.</p>
<p id="fbae2ca6-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner’s effort to construct an immunity from suit for unofficial acts grounded purely in the identity of his office is unsupported by precedent. Petitioner’s strongest argument supporting his immunity claim is based on the text and structure of the Constitution. He does not contend that the occupant of the Office of the President is “above the law,” in the sense that his conduct is entirely immune from judicial scrutiny. The President argues merely for a postponement of the judicial proceedings that will determine whether he violated any law. His argument is grounded in the character of the office that was created by Article II of the Constitution, and relies on separation of powers principles that have structured our constitutional arrangement since the founding.</p>
<p id="fbae2ca7-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a starting premise, petitioner contends that he occupies a unique office with powers and responsibilities so vast and important that the public interest demands that he devote his undivided time and attention to his public duties. He submits that — given the nature of the office — the doctrine of separation of powers places limits on the authority of the Federal Judiciary to interfere with the Executive Branch that would be transgressed by allowing this action to proceed.</p>
<p id="fbae2ca8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have no dispute with the initial premise of the argument. Former presidents, from George Washington to George Bush, have consistently endorsed petitioner’s characterization of the office. It does not follow, however, that separation of powers principles would be violated by allowing this action to proceed. The doctrine of separation of powers is concerned with the allocation of official power among the three co-equal branches of our Government.</p>

Petitioner’s predictive judgment finds little support in either history or the relatively narrow compass of the issues raised in this particular case. As we have already noted, in the more than 200-year history of the Republic, only three sitting Presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. If the past is any indicator, it seems unlikely that a deluge of such litigation will ever engulf the Presidency. As for the case at hand, if properly managed by the District Court, it appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any substantial amount of petitioner’s time.</p>
<p id="fbae2caa-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, “[i]t is settled law that the separation-of-powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the President of the United States.” If the Judiciary may severely burden the Executive Branch by reviewing the legality of the President’s official conduct, and if it may direct appropriate process to the President himself, it must follow that the federal courts have power to determine the legality of his unofficial conduct. The burden on the President’s time and energy that is a mere by-product of such review surely cannot be considered as onerous as the direct burden imposed by judicial review and the occasional invalidation of his official actions. We therefore hold that the doctrine of separation of powers does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.</p>
<p id="fbae53bb-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We add a final comment on two matters that are discussed at length in the briefs: the risk that our decision will generate a large volume of politically motivated harassing and frivolous litigation, and the danger that national security concerns might prevent the President from explaining a legitimate need for a continuance.</p>
<p id="fbae53bc-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not persuaded that either of these risks is serious. Most frivolous and vexatious litigation is terminated at the pleading stage or on summary judgment, with little if any personal involvement by the defendant. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12, 56. Moreover, the availability of sanctions provides a significant deterrent to litigation directed at the President in his unofficial capacity for purposes of political gain or harassment. History indicates that the likelihood that a significant number of such cases will be filed is remote. Although scheduling problems may arise, there is no reason to assume that the District Courts will be either unable to accommodate the President’s needs or unfaithful to the tradition — especially in matters involving national security — of giving “the utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities.” Several Presidents, including petitioner, have given testimony without jeopardizing the Nation’s security. In short, we have confidence in the ability of our federal judges to deal with both of these concerns.</p>
<p id="fbae53bd-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Congress deems it appropriate to afford the President stronger protection, it may respond with appropriate legislation. As petitioner notes in his brief, Congress has enacted more than one statute providing for the deferral of civil litigation to accommodate important public interests.</p>
<p id="fbae53be-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal District Court has jurisdiction to decide this case. Like every other citizen who properly invokes that jurisdiction, respondent has a right to an orderly disposition of her claims.</p>

In March 1974, a federal grand jury considered indicting then-President Richard Nixon and decided instead to declare him an unindicted co-conspirator because it was unsure whether it could indict a sitting President. During the Clinton presidency, there was much discussion as to whether he could be criminally indicted for perjury while in office. This did not occur, either because the Independent Counsel believed that the President had immunity from criminal prosecution or because of a judgment about the merits of the case.</p>
<p id="fbae53c0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the spring of 2019, special counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating possible illegal activities by President Trump, said that he was bound by a Justice Department regulation that prevents indicting a sitting President. Moreover, he said that because Trump could not be indicted, Mueller could not express any views as to whether Trump had engaged in illegal activity. He said that he was not “exonerating” Trump; rather, he deemed it inappropriate to express an opinion about whether Trump had committed illegal acts.</p>
<p id="fbae53c1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the one hand, there is a strong argument that impeachment and removal should be the sole remedy against a President. The danger is that criminal prosecution inevitably would interfere with the President’s ability to perform and that the impeachment process is the appropriate remedy for wrongdoing. On the other hand, no principle is more basic than that no person is above the law. This justifies allowing the President, like all others, to be charged and tried for crimes.</p>

<p id="fbae53c4-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ultimate check on presidential power is impeachment and removal. Article II, §4 of the Constitution provides, “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Article I, §2 provides that the House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach. If there is an impeachment by the House, then a trial is held in the Senate. Article I, §3 gives the Senate the sole power to try impeachments and prescribes that “no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.”</p>
<p id="fbae53c5-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two major issues remain unresolved concerning these provisions. First, what are “high Crimes and Misdemeanors”?

<p id="fbae7ad8-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, what procedures must be followed when there is an impeachment and removal proceeding?

<p id="fbae7ad9-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no definitive answer to either of these questions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11734_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11734_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">26</a></span> There is no Supreme Court case addressing either.

Congress adopted the Tenure in Office Act of 1867 to keep Johnson from firing Lincoln’s cabinet. The act declared that such a firing would be deemed a “high misdemeanor,” indicating that Congress was considering the possibility of impeachment from the outset. The Supreme Court subsequently held that the Tenure in Office Act violated separation of powers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11763_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f" href="#note-N11763_ef80dd8b-f984-11e9-82da-13fa6eda8c9f">29</a></span> Nonetheless, the House impeached and Johnson avoided removal by just one vote in the Senate.</p>
<p id="fbae7ae0-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second serious attempt to impeach a president occurred in 1974 and was directed against Richard Nixon. The House Judiciary Committee voted three articles of impeachment. One was for obstruction of justice in connection with the Watergate cover-up; one was for using government agencies, such as the FBI and the IRS, for political advantages; and the final article was for failing to comply with subpoenas. Before the matter could be considered by the entire House, Nixon resigned.</p>
<p id="fbae7ae1-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most recently, of course, President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998, but the Senate did not convict him. A short version of a long story begins after the Supreme Court decided Clinton v. Jones, above, and allowed Paula Jones’s civil suit against Bill Clinton to proceed. The U.S. District Court then allowed Jones’s attorney to depose President Clinton and permitted questions to be asked about Clinton’s other sexual relationships.</p>
<p id="fbaea1f2-061f-11ea-8d8e-8f6987f9515a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Monica Lewinsky, a former White House aide, had described to her friend Linda Tripp a sexual relationship that Lewinsky had with the president that included many phone calls, private meetings, phone sex, and oral sex.
